4301,4301,6855,"Are there any good, free introductory Dungeon World adventures for a DM used to D&D?","I have been playing &amp; GMing for some time, mostly in various versions of D&amp;D, and other 80s-90s systems. And most of my GMing has been with published adventure modules.

I want to try Dungeon World, so have been looking for a free adventure that would work as an introduction to the system (for both the players and myself). But most of what I can find are ""Dungeon Starters"":


  Dungeon Starters are a form of GM prep for running the first session of a Dungeon World game. Dungeon Starters don’t dictate plot, they’re not Fronts (you write those after the first session), and they don’t replace the GM playbook. They are for those times when you want to just sit down and start a game right then. Dungeon Starters provide a unified flavor to your prep but, when you get down to it, they are really just an unordered cloud of blanks and hooks with some appropriate moving parts to make sure the players don’t catch you with nothing interesting to say. Dungeon Starters are made up of questions, impressions, custom moves, items and services, spells, and monsters (among other things).


Are there any free adventures with a level of detail closer to a D&amp;D module?

I am currently using PyGame to try and write a simple Minesweeper clone, except my sprites that I made are hexagon based and therefore have diagonal lines.

I drew up a nice, clean, crisp vector sprite set which looks very nice in Inkscape, however once I export it everything goes to hell.  I'm going to outline what I've done below and hopefully somebody here can set me straight :D

Disclaimer: Unfortunately I'm behind a proxy and cannot provide screenshots at the moment..I'll do my best to describe.

If I attempt to use a color key (0xFF00FF), then when I set the color key in PyGame I get a bunch of jagged pink edges along my sprite.  I believe this could be an anti-aliasing issue with Inkscape, but unfortunately my Googling didn't turn up a way to disable it.

If I import my PNG into Photoshop or the Gimp and delete the background, then I run into an issue where the background appears to be black when running the game.  I have tried to follow the instructions I saw on SO, but to no avail.

2180,2180,3473,Why do read links turn purple?,"Today I saw a post on Facebook that had this pun:


  Clicked links turn purple because blue + ""read"" equals purple


Is there any specific reason why a link is blue and when it is clicked/read, it turns to purple?

Do these colors have any meaning?
",Shevliaskovic,https://ux.stackexchange.com/users/41986,"There can of course be more than one reason in favour of a decision, whether conscious or unconscious, yet more against bad alternatives (so they get rejected before we even see them) and hence I reckon the other answers here are also partially true. Indeed, quite likely so, since there's an answer here that talks about TimBL while I'm going to talk about Mosaic, which was independent from him.

One stated reason for Mosaic choosing the colour, is that 4-bit colour was still common, and so designs would need to consider how well they would look on such displays. Most such displays used two sets of colours, one of which was of the sequence:

0) Black 1) Blue 2) Red 3) Magenta 4) Green 5) cyan 6) yellow 7) white

(Note the fun way the mixing of colours and adding of numbers has the same results).

Then there would be another set of the same colours, but lighter (sometimes ""light black"" would mean grey, sometimes ""dark white"" would mean grey, sometimes both).

Of this sequence, the colours were darkest to lightest in that order (still true of the equivalents in sRGB, NTSC and other richer colour-spaces, though the exact proportions are generally different). Indeed the scheme was designed so you could depend on different relative shades when used with a monochrome display (black and white, black and green or black and orange).

Hence the darkest colour other than black (already used for normal text) that therefore offered the next-greatest contrast against a white or (as used by said Mosaic browser) grey background, was blue. Hence what would later (when attributes for describing colours where added to HTML) be called #0000FF was the standard link colour. (#000080 would also have been available, but not as distinguished from the black of unlinked text).

Indeed, quite likely so, since there's an answer here that talks about TimBL while I'm going to talk about Mosaic, which was independent from him.

One stated reason for Mosaic choosing the colour, is that 4-bit colour was still common, and so designs would need to consider how well they would look on such displays. Most such displays used two sets of colours, one of which was of the sequence:

0) Black 1) Blue 2) Red 3) Magenta 4) Green 5) cyan 6) yellow 7) white

(Note the fun way the mixing of colours and adding of numbers has the same results).

Then there would be another set of the same colours, but lighter (sometimes ""light black"" would mean grey, sometimes ""dark white"" would mean grey, sometimes both).

Of this sequence, the colours were darkest to lightest in that order (still true of the equivalents in sRGB, NTSC and other richer colour-spaces, though the exact proportions are generally different). Indeed the scheme was designed so you could depend on different relative shades when used with a monochrome display (black and white, black and green or black and orange).

Hence the darkest colour other than black (already used for normal text) that therefore offered the next-greatest contrast against a white or (as used by said Mosaic browser) grey background, was blue. Hence what would later (when attributes for describing colours where added to HTML) be called #0000FF was the standard link colour. (#000080 would also have been available, but not as distinguished from the black of unlinked text).

Red is well-known as a means of emphasis, it would be an appropriate choice for an active link (and was used as such, though I'm pretty sure not until later on, with Netscape Navigator 2.0 if memory serves, since before &lt;frame&gt; and javascript an active link didn't mean much as the page was going to unload anyway), but inadvisable for a visited link, which if anything should be de-emphasised compared to unvisited.

2868,2868,4565,Career advice – mathematics,"I really need some opinions/advice on my situation.

My background

I'm studying for my master degree in mathematics. I have always (since I was 14) wanted to do my own research one day. As I grew older, I knew that mathematics was what I wanted to do. So I went to the university to study mathematics. After having encountered a course in group theory I knew that I belonged to the algebraic part of mathematics. I did my bachelor project in group theory and when I became a graduate student (September 2013), I took courses and made a project supporting my interest in algebra.

Along the way I created the vision that I would finish my master degree as a dedicated student in algebra. In order to realize this vision my plan was to study abroad for one semester taking new algebraic courses.

The situation

My situation today is that my study abroad semester begins tomorrow. As mentioned my dream is to do my own research, but more generally/important: I want to develop new ideas and be dedicated to something and I would love to follow/explore my passion.

My first thought (as many other students): I should get a PhD. So I did some research and figured out that there was an available position at the university I'm currently studying at in geometric group theory.

I don't know much about geometric group theory, but I do know that I love group theory. So I would really like to know if this is an opportunity or if I should just forget it.

I don't want to pursue a PhD for anything in this world. I just want to stay focus on creating a meaningful work life around my passion.

Any advice?



Further remarks

I'm a student from Denmark and I'm studying abroad in Austria for one semester. After my study abroad semester I still have to study one year for my master degree in Denmark. However this year consists of a half year with elective courses and a half year where I'm making my master's thesis. 

I don’t know much about the PhD position. I found it from a Google search (: “PhD position group theory”). There is only given a starting date and an e-mail address for contact. I’m going to attend a course held by the supervisor of the project, so the whole thing is a coincidence. 

I have investigated my opportunities for a position at my home university. One of my supervisors, a professor in group theory, told me that he couldn't offer me a position, since it was a question about money, but would like to recommend me. I don't think the university accepts PhD students without a master degree and the positions are without project descriptions.

However there is also another university (in Denmark) with a talent program where it is possible to get a PhD position without having a master degree. I contacted them and they told me I should apply after my study abroad semester (because I would have a stronger profile). But I don't know my chances.
",HelloProfile,https://academia.stackexchange.com/users/12557,"I'm having a lot of trouble nailing down your question.

From this I am guessing that you are not in the US, because in the US one would not have a position in ""geometric group theory"" specifically; one would just apply to the entire math department.

It seems clear that a PhD in geometric group theory is an indeed an opportunity to do everything that you said you wanted to do...in geometric group theory, which is a subfield of the field that you say you like.  Whether you will like GGT specifically seems best answered by learning some and finding out.  If the PhD program is so specifically invested in GGT that if you find out you don't want to do GGT per se then you'll need to leave the program, then you should study GGT on your own / during your master's degree first in order to find out whether it's interesting enough to you to spend years of your life on.  (I think GGT is really interesting.  If I hadn't done arithmetic geometry, I think I would have had fun with it.  So I assure you that there is nothing wrong with that subsubfield of mathematics!)

1460,1460,2297,How do I deal with a slow and undedicated colleague in the team?,"I have been working on a new project. The project works like this: The end user can access a webapp using a link and he can add multiple systems on his network and manage that particular systems details. My part involves the front end and the webserver, which is done in python. My python actually communicates with another project which is entirely done in c &amp; c++. The c/c++ project is the main app which does all the functionality. My python sends the user request to it and displays the response from it to the user. 

I am very familiar with my work and I will finish it soon. Since that's not much work in it. And I am a person who loves to work. I spends most of the time in office and only go home when I feel sleepy.

The c/c++ app is managed by another colleague who has 5+ year experience and can do things much faster than me, but he never does it. May be he doesn't like to do it. His app crashes often when my python communicate with it or returns wrong values. It's full of bugs. Since my app depends on it, I am having a hard time building it. Instead of fixing the bugs, he asks me to slow down my work. He asks me to tell manager that my work needs a lot of time. He is asking me to fool the manager and even forcing me to work slowly like him.

During project meeting, when manager asks him about the bugs he says that he fixed everything and it works fine. Since he is my colleague, I couldn't tell anything to the manager. I obviously need to have a good relationship with my colleagues more than my manager, since most of the time we will be with our colleagues, not with the manager.

I am not able to tell the manager anything regarding this, since if manager asks him why, then he may think I complained about him to the manager. And he keeps on lying in the meeting. And since he fixes the bug slowly, it even slows down my work. Now I thought of working on the front-end part of my app  and finishing it off so that in the mean time he can make his project stable. Now he is asking me to tell the manager that my front end part require a lot of work and I may need more and more time, simply so that he can drag the project down. And the sad thing is our actual manager has gone to the US, so we have a temporary manager and this guy doesn't know about the project much, so the c,c++ just fools him.

Can anyone suggest me how I deal with this?
I wanted to finish off the project soon. How can I make him work even by maintaining a good relationship with him?

Responses to comments:


  If he's really deliberately misleading the company, you should report him to management.


I am new to this company and the other guy has been there for many years. And I have just started knowing my colleagues. If I directly go and complaint him, I don't think so I can make good relationship with my other colleagues. Even he has the power to mislead them. I am not telling he is a bad guy, he can do the work, but he is not doing it.


  Doesn't your company have any kind of bug tracking system ? 


Here actual bug tracking system isn't there. The company tries to finish off the project as soon as possible and gives it to the QA. And then fixes the bugs reported by QA. 


  This is why companies should give employees stock / options or some sort of ownership. That way you can literally tell the guy ""You are costing me monetary growth... don't you want to make money also?"".


The company has the stock options they have given me a 2500 share, mostly he too would have got some more.


  Seniority does deserve some benefit of a doubt. You really need to speak to him first and try to understand the problem. He may be out of his depth, you may be able to help him, there could easily be variables you are unaware of. It may be hard now, but you could easily make the situation a lot worse by jumping the gun. 


I even does it, first his app wasn't handling multiple requests at a time, he was using a queue to handle the requests I sent to him. I even suggested to him some of my ideas on it. He said he already had these ideas, and will be executing them. His explanations was: ""Everything require certain time to do and this is a project which may need two years to complete and we are asked to finish it in two months"". I used to have a hard time coding during first few weeks because of this bug. But now he fixed it. But he is using a single queue for a user requests and that is now slowing down the app, since it processes one request at a time.


  What is QA doing this whole time? Why aren't they reporting/confirming the status of the project(s)? 


The manager is the person who decides when to give to the QA. As of now it has not yet given to QA. He said we should give it by this month end.

I have a question about a CMOS circuit, which I have been designing for me, while using 4066. I use 4066 to transmit random pulses, and I generate a feed noise generator with two outputs (the generator is connected to a JFET amplifier and then clamped with diodes to two different DC voltages) to 4050 (a buffer for each noise generator output). The pulse works normally. The only problem is that when 4066 is not enabled, about 1 volt pulses pass through each switch. I wonder if there is any way to solve this problem!

3082,3082,4906,God the Father's possession of a body of flesh and bones,"There is a belief out there that God the Father has always possessed a body of flesh and bones. Some of the proponents of this belief don't find it contradictory to John 4:24 (""God is a Spirit"") as the verse may be referring only to one part of God without limiting God to being only that one part - just like, for example, in 1 Pet 3:20 (""eight souls were saved by water"") Peter called some humans ""souls"", but he didn't mean by that that they didn't posses bodies.

The example of Jesus after His resurrection, Who, while possessing a body of flesh and bones, still retains all the qualities that are usually ascribed only to God, for example, His omnipresence, could go along with this belief. 

I wonder if Biblical hermeneutics, namely the hermeneutics of the Old Testament, allows for this belief. If not, please, point out those places that speak against the validity of this belief.

You will need to do two things:


Edit your Ethernet interface in NetworkManager, choose Routes and then select Use this connection only for resources on its network.
Add static routes here for all of the IP address ranges in use on your corporate network that you need to access. The gateway for these should be your current gateway IP address for the eth0 interface. You can obtain a list of these networks from your network admin staff.




Once you have completed this, all of your traffic will go out via your wireless connection unless it's on one of the networks you specified a static route for.

You will probably need to set up your browser as well, so that it only proxies traffic bound for IP address ranges inside the corporate network. Better yet, use two Firefox profiles: one for the corporate network and one for general Internet usage.

Add static routes here for all of the IP address ranges in use on your corporate network that you need to access. The gateway for these should be your current gateway IP address for the eth0 interface. You can obtain a list of these networks from your network admin staff.




Once you have completed this, all of your traffic will go out via your wireless connection unless it's on one of the networks you specified a static route for.

You will probably need to set up your browser as well, so that it only proxies traffic bound for IP address ranges inside the corporate network. Better yet, use two Firefox profiles: one for the corporate network and one for general Internet usage.

(Part of this answer, and the above image, borrowed from the Ask Ubuntu question Force network-manager to use wireless for an Internet connection.)

5262,5262,8363,Decoding Matrix Encoded Surround Sound Through Convolution,"I wish to create a finite impulse response filter to decode a dolby digital matrix encoded 2 channel signal into 5 channels.

",psandersen,https://dsp.stackexchange.com/users/3142,"Jbarlow's answer is excellently derived but misses a major issue: Almost all of the ""better"" surround sound decoders such as Dolby Prologic, DTS Neo 6, Lexicon, Bose Videostage are ""dynmaic"", i.e. they looks constantly at the signal conditions and adjust the decoding matrix in the fly based on an estimate what the original signals may have been.

The main problem here is that the encoder is ""lossy"", i.e. a lot of information is lost during the encoding process and you can't fully recover the original signal. A simple example: let's say you start a ""left"" signal. That encodes to Lt = 1 and Rt = 0. Decoding this again then leads to signal in all five channels and not just in the left like the original condition. The only way around this is to dynamically look at correlation and panning of the input signals and adjust the decoder matrix on the fly.

Finally, while jbarlow's equations are mathematically correct, it's typically not done this way, even if it's only a static decoder. The main issue is that this creates side to side cross talk, i.e. signals that where original in the left front can end up partially in the right front which highly undesirable from a perceptual point of view.

What information will we have access to (through headers of the web page requests etc.) which we can use to uniquely identify this trusted client machine? 

Obviously a user can have more than one trusted client machine, and I completely expect that if they use two different browsers on the same trusted machine machine, each browser will have to be trusted independently.

Setting a cookie on the machine with some GUID which means this is trusted simply would not be good enough, as someone else could just copy the cookie, and create it on their own browser circumventing the two factor authentication.

Indeed, that's the easiest thing to do, since you don't have to hunt for the cookies. Javascript can't read anything outside these directories, so they have just duplicated the system.

However, you can use Flash/Java to fingerprint the browser. Unfortunately, the browser fingerprint can change if the user installs fonts/etc. Besides, your users will have to allow the Flash/Java to run -- nowadays quite a few people are disabling Java due to the recent 0 Day exploit. You don't want to force your users to have to use these. Anyway, one can easily replicate a fingerprint by replicating the system (which takes time, but isn't too hard).

In the end, two factor auth is all about (a) having a password, and (b) having physical access to a device. If you are giving someone unsupervised access to your computer while logged in as you, part (b) is compromised anyway, in a different manner.

5589,5589,8870,What does “sign the final flourish” mean?,"There was the following sentence in Time magazine’s a bit old  article (December 11, 2013) titled, “Pope Francis, the people’s Pope,” in which I was drawn to the phrase, “sign the final flourish”: 


  “He returned o Buenos Aires and looked to retirement. - - He handed
  his letter of resignation to the Pope when he turned 75 in 2011.”I’m
  starting to consider the fact that I have to leave everything behind,”
  he said in 2010. “It makes me want to be fair with everyone always, to
  sign the final flourish ... But death is my thought every day.” He
  insisted he was not sad, and he went on posing for pictures with the
  faithful.”
  
  http://poy.time.com/2013/12/11/person-of-the-year-pope-francis-the-peoples-pope/


I thought “sign the flourish” an idiom, but I don’t find the phrase in dictionaries I use to consult, or on Google.”  

I wondered if it’s similar with Japanese idiom, “一花咲かせる－hitohana sakaseru” meaning to bloom the last blossoms at the ending, at the last stage of one's career, or before retiring, like a baseball player who passed his peak hitting a streak of homeruns before retiring, but then, the word, “sign” seems to be incongruent.

Or, does “sign the flourish” mean “sign by using decorated-letters”?

What does the phrase, Pope wanted to “sign the final flourish” mean?

5981,5981,9482,How do I deal with a slow and undedicated colleague in the team?,"I have been working on a new project. The project works like this: The end user can access a webapp using a link and he can add multiple systems on his network and manage that particular systems details. My part involves the front end and the webserver, which is done in python. My python actually communicates with another project which is entirely done in c &amp; c++. The c/c++ project is the main app which does all the functionality. My python sends the user request to it and displays the response from it to the user. 

I am very familiar with my work and I will finish it soon. Since that's not much work in it. And I am a person who loves to work. I spends most of the time in office and only go home when I feel sleepy.

The c/c++ app is managed by another colleague who has 5+ year experience and can do things much faster than me, but he never does it. May be he doesn't like to do it. His app crashes often when my python communicate with it or returns wrong values. It's full of bugs. Since my app depends on it, I am having a hard time building it. Instead of fixing the bugs, he asks me to slow down my work. He asks me to tell manager that my work needs a lot of time. He is asking me to fool the manager and even forcing me to work slowly like him.

During project meeting, when manager asks him about the bugs he says that he fixed everything and it works fine. Since he is my colleague, I couldn't tell anything to the manager. I obviously need to have a good relationship with my colleagues more than my manager, since most of the time we will be with our colleagues, not with the manager.

I am not able to tell the manager anything regarding this, since if manager asks him why, then he may think I complained about him to the manager. And he keeps on lying in the meeting. And since he fixes the bug slowly, it even slows down my work. Now I thought of working on the front-end part of my app  and finishing it off so that in the mean time he can make his project stable. Now he is asking me to tell the manager that my front end part require a lot of work and I may need more and more time, simply so that he can drag the project down. And the sad thing is our actual manager has gone to the US, so we have a temporary manager and this guy doesn't know about the project much, so the c,c++ just fools him.

Can anyone suggest me how I deal with this?
I wanted to finish off the project soon. How can I make him work even by maintaining a good relationship with him?

Responses to comments:


  If he's really deliberately misleading the company, you should report him to management.


I am new to this company and the other guy has been there for many years. And I have just started knowing my colleagues. If I directly go and complaint him, I don't think so I can make good relationship with my other colleagues. Even he has the power to mislead them. I am not telling he is a bad guy, he can do the work, but he is not doing it.


  Doesn't your company have any kind of bug tracking system ? 


Here actual bug tracking system isn't there. The company tries to finish off the project as soon as possible and gives it to the QA. And then fixes the bugs reported by QA. 


  This is why companies should give employees stock / options or some sort of ownership. That way you can literally tell the guy ""You are costing me monetary growth... don't you want to make money also?"".


The company has the stock options they have given me a 2500 share, mostly he too would have got some more.


  Seniority does deserve some benefit of a doubt. You really need to speak to him first and try to understand the problem. He may be out of his depth, you may be able to help him, there could easily be variables you are unaware of. It may be hard now, but you could easily make the situation a lot worse by jumping the gun. 


I even does it, first his app wasn't handling multiple requests at a time, he was using a queue to handle the requests I sent to him. I even suggested to him some of my ideas on it. He said he already had these ideas, and will be executing them. His explanations was: ""Everything require certain time to do and this is a project which may need two years to complete and we are asked to finish it in two months"". I used to have a hard time coding during first few weeks because of this bug. But now he fixed it. But he is using a single queue for a user requests and that is now slowing down the app, since it processes one request at a time.


  What is QA doing this whole time? Why aren't they reporting/confirming the status of the project(s)? 


The manager is the person who decides when to give to the QA. As of now it has not yet given to QA. He said we should give it by this month end.

In other words, you can't make these at home. You need to use traditional home canning equipment (e.g., mason jars) instead. If you want bags of beans, I suggest freezing them; beans keep fairly well frozen.

5198,5198,8256,"Variations in the pronunciation of ""the""","Although there are rather simple rules determining the pronunciation of ""the"", native speakers quite often deviate from these rules (including, e.g., TV shows). According to the Longman Pronunciation Dictionary,


  The EFL learner is advised to use [ðə] before a consonant sound (the
  boy, the house), [ði] before a vowel sound (the egg, the hour). Native
  speakers, however, sometimes ignore this distribution, in particular
  by using [ðə] before a vowel (which is in turn usually reinforced by a
  preceding ʔ), or by using [ði:] in any
  environment, though especially before a hesitation pause. Furthermore,
  some speakers use stressed [ðə] as a strong form, rather than the
  usual [ði:].


My question is: when native speakers use [ðə] instead of [ði] before a vowel sound, do they do it on purpose or accidentally? If it is on purpose, how do they (typically) decide which pronunciation to use? What is a valid reason to use [ðə] before a vowel sound?

1285,1285,2028,Reliable way of detecting whether an Android app is running in 'BlueStacks',"I would like to ascertain at run-time inside an Android app whether it is running within the BlueStacks Android emulator. This is so I can modify the way the app runs when running inside BlueStacks.

BlueStacks does not support multi-touch so I want to implement an alternative to the standard pinch-to-zoom functionality my current app has.

E.g.

If (appIsRunningInBlueStacks){
    mySurfaceView.enableMultiTouchAlternatives();
} else{
    mySurfaceView.enableMultiTouchFeatures();
}


What is a reliable way of ascertaining the value of appIsRunningInBlueStacks?

EDIT Summary of answers to comments on question:

Ben, Taras, thanks for the suggestions. The Build.MODEL etc. values for BlueStacks are:


Model: ""GT-I9100""
Manufacturer: ""samsung""
Device: ""GT-I9100""
Product: ""GT-I9100""


This is the same model number as the Samsung Galaxy SII so it would not be ideal to use this for fear of treating all users with SIIs the same as those on BlueStacks.

CommonsWare, the app continues to run in BlueStacks even with the &lt; uses-feature> for multitouch in the manifest. In fact (also answering iagreen's question)...

packageManager.hasSystemFeature(PackageManager.FEATURE_TOUCHSCREEN_MULTITOUCH_DISTINCT);


... returns true! This is to be expected I suppose as the emulator is convinced it is a Samsung Galaxy SII!

Therefore we are still without a way of reliably detecting whether an app is running on BlueStacks without also throwing all Samsung Galaxy SII users in the same bucket. Any other ideas?

4379,4379,6966,How does owning a home and paying on a mortgage fit into family savings and investment?,"I'm in my mid-20's, and so I am aiming at long-term growth with higher risk in my portfolio.  My financial adviser is showing me some investment allocations that put my money in some growth, mid, and value-retention locations.  He doesn't seem to be taking into the equation the fact that I am putting a huge percentage of my paycheck into my home.

I know home values fluctuate, but long term, it seems to be a pretty good way to at least retain value, and at best make a small return.  If I am already contributing so much to my ""home"" investment, why would I also invest in stocks or bonds with a low rate of return, even though they are considered a ""safe"" part of my portfolio?

Update: I think the question really has two parts.

1) How does owning a home fit into my financial portfolio?  Most seem to agree that at best it is a hedge against rent or dollar inflation, and at worst it should be viewed as a liability, and has no place alongside other real investments.

2) How should one view payments on a home mortgage?  How are they similar or different to investing in low-risk low-reward investments?

  1) How does owning a home fit into my financial portfolio? Most seem to agree that at best it is a hedge against rent or dollar inflation, and at worst it should be viewed as a liability, and has no place alongside other real investments.


Periods of high inflation are generally accompanied with high(er) interest rates. Any home is a liability, as has been pointed out in other answers; it costs money to live in, it costs money to keep in good shape, and it offers you no return unless you sell it for more than you have paid for it in total (in fact, as long as you have an outstanding mortgage, it actually costs you money to own, even when not considering things like property taxes, utilities etc.).

The only way to make a home an investment is to rent it out for more than it costs you in total to own, but then you can't live in it instead.


  2) How should one view payments on a home mortgage? How are they similar or different to investing in low-risk low-reward investments?


Like JoeTaxpayer said in a comment, paying off your mortgage should be considered the same as putting money into a certificate of deposit with a term and return equivalent to your mortgage interest cost (adjusting for tax effects). What is important to remember about paying off a mortgage, besides the simple and not so unimportant fact that it lowers your financial risk over time, is that over time it improves your cash flow.

If interest rates don't change (unlikely), then as long as you keep paying the interest vigilantly but don't pay down the principal (assuming that the bank is happy with such an arrangement), your monthly cost remains the same and will do so in perpetuity. You currently have a cash flow that enables you to pay down the principal on the loan, and are putting some fairly significant amount of money towards that end. Now, suppose that you were to lose your job, which means a significant cut in the household income. If this cut means that you can't afford paying down the mortgage at the same rate as before, you can always call the bank and tell them to stop the extra payments until you get your ducks back in the proverbial row. It's also possible, with a long history of paying on time and a loan significantly smaller than what the house would bring in in a sale, that you could renegotiate the loan with an extended term, which depending on the exact terms may lower your monthly cost further. If the size of the loan is largely the same as or perhaps even exceeds the market value of the house, the bank would be a lot more unlikely to cooperate in such a scenario.

It's also a good idea to at the very least aim to be free of debt by the time you retire. Even if one assumes that the pension systems will be the same by then as they are now (some don't, but that's a completely different question), you are likely to see a significant cut in cash flow on retirement day. Any fixed expenses which cannot easily be cut if needed are going to become a lot more of a liability when you are actually at least in part living off your savings rather than contributing to them.

The earlier you get the mortgage paid off, the earlier you will have the freedom to put into other forms of savings the money which is now going not just to principal but to interest as well. What is important to consider is that paying off a mortgage is a very illiquid form of savings; on the other hand, money in stocks, bonds, various mutual funds, and savings accounts, tends to be highly liquid. It is always a good idea to have some savings in easily accessible form, some of it in very low-risk investments such as a simple interest-bearing savings account or government bonds (despite their low rate of return) before you start to aggressively pay down loans, because (particularly when you own a home) you never know when something might come up that ends up costing a fair chunk of money.

The pulses work perfectly. The only problem is, when the 4066 is not enabled, about 1 volt of the pulses pass through each switch. I was wondering if there was any way to fix that! Here is my circuit:


",Zack Frost,https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/37971,"As noted, adding a resistor to the desired ""idle state"" voltage will cause the output to swing to that voltage when the 4066 is disabled.  If one would like the output to stay at its present voltage when the 4066 is disabled, and if one is driving a high-impedance load, one may instead use a capacitor.  If a capacitor is used, then while the 4066 is enabled the cap voltage will swing toward the input, and when it is disabled it will tend to stay more or less where it is (though it will likely drift away from its present voltage at some speed).  The larger the cap, the more slowly the cap will switch to the desired voltage, but the more slowly it will drift away.  Feeding the output of the 4066 into an op amp wired as a voltage follower may also slow down the drift.

I'm not sure exactly what you are intending your circuit for, but some kinds of ""random computer noise"" were historically generated by feeding a noise source through an analog switch which was turned on briefly about 5-10 times/second, and then a cap; the voltage on that cap was then used to control the frequency of an oscillator.

If a capacitor is used, then while the 4066 is enabled the cap voltage will swing toward the input, and when it is disabled it will tend to stay more or less where it is (though it will likely drift away from its present voltage at some speed).  The larger the cap, the more slowly the cap will switch to the desired voltage, but the more slowly it will drift away.  Feeding the output of the 4066 into an op amp wired as a voltage follower may also slow down the drift.

I'm not sure exactly what you are intending your circuit for, but some kinds of ""random computer noise"" were historically generated by feeding a noise source through an analog switch which was turned on briefly about 5-10 times/second, and then a cap; the voltage on that cap was then used to control the frequency of an oscillator.

3729,3729,5942,How can I draw these pictures with TikZ?,"I have the following images:

Binary Decision Diagram (BDD):



Binary Decision Tree (BDT):



and I would like to draw them in LaTeX with TikZ. 

Furthermore, I would like to make them ""consistent"" between each other (i.e., 0-edges becomes dashed arrows in both images, the two pictures must be in black and not in grayscale, no need for the labels on the arrows of the BDD).

How can this be done ?

So far I can only make the BDT with one style of arrow, and I have absolutely no idea how to make the BDD :|

"
2732,2732,4353,Finding the smallest binary relation in a given set including a relation,"The following binary relation of the set {a, b, c, d, e} is given:

R = { (a,b), (a,c), (b,c) }

What I have to do is to find the smallest reflexive / symmetric / transitive / antisymmetric relation including R.

I know what these relations are all about, but what I have trouble with is how to find them. For example, I see no reflexive relation in the set. Does ""including R"" mean that i can extend R with any element from the given set? So for example, if I am looking for a reflexion can I just add (a, a)?

If I can extend the set, my solution would be:

Reflexive: Add (a,a)
Symmetric: Add (b,a)
Transitive: Already satisfied
Antisymmetric: Already satisfied? I am not sure about this one

",xxsl,https://math.stackexchange.com/users/184856,"You're on the right track. ""Containing"" means just what you would think, since $R$ is a set, we want another set of pairs of elements $(x,y)\in S\times S$ so that $R\subseteq R'$ and $R'$ has one of the properties you mention.

First you need to add $(x,x)$ for every $x\in S=\{a,b,c,d,e\}$ which will give you $R_r=R\cup\{(a,a),(b,b),(c,c), (d,d), (e,e)\}$--the smallest reflexive relation containing $R$.

For a symmetric one, you need to add all of the elements of $R$ where you switch $x$ and $y$, i.e. $R_s=R\cup\{(b,a), (c,a), (c,b)\}$

Continuing for the others, we need a transitive one, so we need to see if there are $xRy$ and $yRz$, and in-fact there is exactly one, namely since $aRb$ and $bRc$ we need to add $aRc$, but you already have $(a,c)\in R$, so $R_t=R$.

Finally anti-symmetry is already satisfied, since there are no $x,y\in S$ such that $xRy$ and $yRx$, so $R=R_a$ is already anti-symmetric. If you have trouble seeing how this is, remember that antisymmetric is parsed in logical symbols as

""Containing"" means just what you would think, since $R$ is a set, we want another set of pairs of elements $(x,y)\in S\times S$ so that $R\subseteq R'$ and $R'$ has one of the properties you mention.

First you need to add $(x,x)$ for every $x\in S=\{a,b,c,d,e\}$ which will give you $R_r=R\cup\{(a,a),(b,b),(c,c), (d,d), (e,e)\}$--the smallest reflexive relation containing $R$.

For a symmetric one, you need to add all of the elements of $R$ where you switch $x$ and $y$, i.e. $R_s=R\cup\{(b,a), (c,a), (c,b)\}$

Continuing for the others, we need a transitive one, so we need to see if there are $xRy$ and $yRz$, and in-fact there is exactly one, namely since $aRb$ and $bRc$ we need to add $aRc$, but you already have $(a,c)\in R$, so $R_t=R$.

Finally anti-symmetry is already satisfied, since there are no $x,y\in S$ such that $xRy$ and $yRx$, so $R=R_a$ is already anti-symmetric. If you have trouble seeing how this is, remember that antisymmetric is parsed in logical symbols as

$$\forall x,y\in S (xRy\land yRx\implies x=y)$$

Since the set of $x,y\in S$ such that $xRy$ and $yRx$ is empty, the condition is vacuously true because all $\forall z\in\varnothing$ statements are vacuously true because the negation is $\exists z'\in\varnothing$ which is clearly false, since there are no elements in an empty set.

211,211,337,What exactly is computation?,"I know what computation is in some vague sense (it is the thing computers do), but I would like a more rigorous definition. 

Dictionary.com's definitions of computation, computing, calculate, and compute are circular, so it doesn't help. 

Wikipedia defines computation to be ""any type of calculation that follows a well-defined model."" 
It defines calculation as ""the deliberate process that transforms one or more inputs into one or more results, with variable change."" But it seems this definition includes many actions as computations even though they aren't typically thought of as computation. 

For example, wouldn't this entail that, say, a bomb exploding is a computation, with the input being the fuse being lighted and the output being the explosion?

So, what exactly is computation?
",Kelmikra,https://cs.stackexchange.com/users/24518,"This is the question that Turing set out to solve in his famous 1936 paper, On computable numbers, with an application to the Entscheidungsproblem, a paper in which he comes up with (what came to be known as) the Turing machine model. See in particular Section 9.

Turing's work is in the context of computable numbers. There are other notions of computation appropriate for computing other kinds of structures, and their study forms part of computation theory (also known as recursion theory).

The main difference between the common notion of computation and your example (an exploding bomb) is the thing being computed. What is being computed by your exploding bomb? Another difference is the computational means, but one can envision a mechanical contraption which uses bombs to compute something more legitimate.

Another point is whether the classical notions of computation apply to what we perceive today as computation – namely, two-way interaction between the computer and the user. This is a common criticism levelled against the classical notional of computability, though interaction can be modelled using the tools of computation theory (it's just not what you learn in class).

2787,2787,4440,Fiona - Preffered method for defining a schema,"I'm fairly new to the world of python and GIS - so this is definitely a beginner question.

I am following Tom Macwrights small guide to Shapely and Fiona, and I noticed that even when opening the previously created shapefile, it doesn't contain the schema I defined using:

schema = { 
      'geometry': 'Point', 
      'properties': { 'name': 'str' } }


This is evident because when I try to call it using schema = input.schema.copy(), it spits out AttributeError: 'function' object has no attribute 'schema'

Reading the Fiona documentation, it states that:


  the schema of its record type (a vector file has a single type of record, remember) is accessed via a read-only schema attribute. 


Does that mean that it is not possible to store a schema in the shapefile,a nd therefore I'm always required set up the variables in the beginning, rather than reading from the file using input.schema.copy()? Or do I setup the schema using Records? 

If so, how do you read from a csv file (as in Tom's example) and place the data into the records to be read from input.schema.copy()? is it helpful to do this, or am I just complicating things and should define the schema every time i open the shapefile?

Thanks for the help - I'm really interested in developing my understanding of the processes occurring.

create a new shapefile
modify the original schema: for that, it's easier to just copy things to a new shapefile and make the changes as you copy


Create a new Polyline shapefile:



import fiona
# schema: it is a simple dictionary with geometry and properties as keys
schema = {'geometry': 'LineString','properties': {'test': 'int'}}
# for defining the geometry, you need Shapely
from shapely.geometry import LineString, mapping
# two simples geometries
lines = [LineString([(272830.63,155125.73),(273770.32,155467.75)]),LineString([(273536.47,155914.07),(272033.12,152265.71)])]

    for line in lines:
        # filling schema
        elem = {}
        # geometry with mapping function of shapely
        elem['geometry'] = mapping(line)

        elem['properties'] = {'test': 145}
        # writing element in the file
        layer.write(elem)



Now we want to modify the schema of the original shapefile in a new shapefile:


1) Open the original shapefile:

shapefile =fiona.open('myshp.shp')
#read the schema
schema2 = shapefile.schema
print schema2
{'geometry': 'LineString', 'properties': OrderedDict([(u'test', 'int:10')])}


2) As it is a dictionary, it is easy to add new fields/keys in the properties:

schema2['properties']['string']='str'


3) Now we create a new shapefile copying myshp.shp with the new schema :

with fiona.open('myshp.shp', 'r') as input:
    schema = schema2
    # writing the new shapefile
    with fiona.open('myshp_copy.shp', 'w', 'ESRI Shapefile', schema) as output:
        for elem in input:
            # add the new attribute value
            elem['properties']['string']=""hello""
            output.write({'properties': elem['properties'],'geometry': mapping(shape(elem['geometry']))})



verification


c = fiona.open('myshp_copy.shp')
c.schema
{'geometry': 'LineString', 'properties': OrderedDict([(u'test', 'int:10'), (u'string', 'str')])}
# first element of the shapefile
c.next()

What you're looking for is an upgraded sway bar.  This is ""... usually a torsion spring that resists body roll motions.""  This is in contrast to a strut bar ""... designed to reduce ... strut tower flex by tying two parallel strut towers together.""

In general, if your goal is to reduce body roll, one of the cheapest ways to do so is to upgrade the sway bar(s).  Strut tower bars will have a much more limited effect and should usually be considered after upgrading tires, sway bars, struts and springs (i.e., much later).

Caveat: increasing the roll stiffness will change your under/oversteering biases.  Specifically, a stiffer bar in the front generally increases understeer.  Likewise, a stiffer rear will increase oversteer.  That said, I had a 97 Integra some time back and installed an adjustable rear sway bar.  I adored its steering responsiveness in the summer but also managed to scare myself several times in the winter....

I'm going to be in a public area taking portraits of many people (for example, at a themed, public event, or while doing a 100 Strangers Project, etc..)

After taking someone's portrait, I want them to give them access to their portrait (and only theirs, not everyone else's).

So, given all the pictures I take that day, how can I keep track of all the photos (matching up them up with their portrait, and then providing them a way to see/share the photo)? Also, what token, if any, could I give them to find or receive their photo later on?

Requirements

The ideal solution for me would


give them access to only their portrait
minimize the amount of personal information I get from them at the time of encounter (a name only, for example. The assumption is that people would not want to give out their contact information.)

This would require some custom software, because I don't think there's nothing out-of-the-box (it might be interesting to develop, so I'm thinking about doing it on my spare time just for fun!).

Basically you upload the pictures to a server (tagged with place and date, to constrain a little bit the search, being less computationally expensive and adding an extra layer of security).

You give the address of the public access for the server to the people you photograph (in printed business cards or however you decide), maybe along your user id if it's shared among different photographers.

The person that was photographed goes to the server, enters your photographer id, place and date the picture was taken. Then a different picture from them is requested, it might be taken with the computer webcam or mobile camera for convenience, or just uploaded.

The server looks up in the library of faces for that day and place, and shows the user the ones that match his or her face!

If there are no matches (face recognition is not perfect after all), they could still send a human verification request and you could give them access manually.

5410,5410,8592,Putting the cursor back at the bash prompt after a script returns delayed output,"Just a minor issue. I'm writing a simple bash script that starts and stops Jetty. When I execute it, the script immediately puts my cursor back on the bash prompt. However, as Jetty starts up and writes its initialization output back to stdout, it leaves the cursor on a line of its own (without a prompt) until I enter a command or hit enter.

Here's the script:

else

3409,3409,5431,Need help using vba to fill in blanks left by excel pivot table when using %difference from previous row,"So, I'm not very knowledgeable at all yet when it comes to VBA. I have experience with Java, so I understand the concepts of structure behind coding and can read/understand basic-intermediate code. But when it comes to writing it myself, I'm definitely still a 1.5 out of 10 in terms of writing VBA myself. So, any help would be greatly appreciated.

So I have the following example pivot table (my actual is about 10 years of data with a few more columns):


The red and yellow dots are my problem areas. The columns with blank titles are just %differences from the previous row. However, as you can see, using that leaves blank spaces for the first month of every year (those are the yellow dots). Also, for the year lines, it doesn't calculate the %difference from the previous year (the red dots).

So, what I'm needing is (most likely) a PivotTableUpdate or PivotTableChangeSync (I still don't understand the difference actually by the way) to fill in data in those cells with the red and yellow dots. Any thoughts?

Edit: As requested, here's the data powering the pivot table:

4837,4837,7695,Indexing encrypted data for efficient searching,"I have implemented encryption for certain columns in a database. In some cases it may be necessary to search by these columns, either for exact matches or for substrings. At the moment, there is less than 10000 rows to search through (at most). However this will probably change in the future so I am anticipating efficency problems. 

The data will remain encrypted in the database, but when retrieved by the application, it can then be decrypted. This means that the retrieval does not have to be 100% accurate, it can retrieve more records than actually match the query, and the application itself can discard the non-matching records. 

With this in mind I came up with the following solutions:


For exact text match, hash the encrypted data and modulo this with a relatively low number (2^16 perhaps), and store that value in an additional column. When querying the database, it is only necessary to perform the same operation on the input string, and retrieve all records with matching hash value.
For finding substrings, hash each letter and mod 32 the result. Then set the corresponding bit in an integer. Perform the same operation on the query string. Thus it is only necessary to retrieve records where the result of a binary AND on the query with the stored value is greater than 0. This could also be done using each pair of letters, perhaps with a 64-bit or longer integer to allow for more records to be discarded.


My question is, would either of these techniques have a real impact on the security of the data in the encrypted columns? The encryption scheme is AES-256.
",Slicedpan,https://security.stackexchange.com/users/28559,"Ability to narrow searches tends to be in direct opposition with the confidentiality that you seek through encryption. For instance, if you store your ""16-bit hash"" in an extra column then that hash reveals 16 bits of the data -- 16 indirect bits, but 16 bits nonetheless. An attacker who sees the database may try to guess (brute force) the record contents, and the 16 bits will allow him to detect 65535/65536th of bad guesses: this is a substantial advantage.

Ability to do substring searches is even worse, since it necessarily reveals information that allows the brute force attack to proceed in gradual steps (this is in fact the same problem as partial password authentication).

At best, what you could do is to implement deterministic encryption, such that encryption of a given record value always yields the same encrypted result. This leaks a modicus of information (if two records have the same contents then this will show, despite the encryption layer); on the other hand, it allows for exact searches: you encrypt the value to search, and use the index on the encrypted values. Substring searches, however, should be avoided at all costs.



I think a better method would be to revisit your assumptions:


  However this will probably change in the future so I am anticipating efficency problems.


Usually, performance issues don't exist until having been actually encountered (at least in a test platform, if not in production) and duly measured. As Donald Knuth once wrote: premature optimization is the root of all evil.

Even if the envisioned performance issue is real and you know how much it will cost, some alternate methods might be applicable. For instance, you could read all the records in the RAM of the application, decrypt them all, and keep them in RAM. This would allow very fast searches without even going to the SQL level. Modern servers have a lot of RAM. As an example, the servers that maintain the StackExchange sites (all of them) are reputed to have been sufficiently boosted in RAM (a few hundred gigabytes) so that all the data can be cached, and the servers can perform all read accesses at RAM speed.

I am trying to understand how wave soldering works. Unfortunately the Wikipedia article has has left me unsure about the process:


Is the entire board with its components quasi-immersed in liquid solder while it passes through the wave? (If not, the following question probably make no sense.)
If the board cuts into the wave, how is the wave maintained?
Why does this not leave superflous solder residue on the board?

For wave soldering the PCB passes over a bath of molten solder where the solder is pushed up so that it strikes along the bottom side of the PCB. You'll need a solder resist mask to prevent to have solder over all the copper. 

Note that also SMDs can be wave soldered, but then the orientation of the parts is important. Some parts have to be placed perpendicular to the wave direction. Fine pitch parts like 0.4 mm QFPs can't be wave soldered because all the pins will be shorted, but QFPs with a higher pitch can. They need ""solder thieves"", which are solder pads at the end of a row of pins to gather residual solder.

So it can be that your device has absolutely no juice left to run. An example of such a device is the BlackBerry PlayBook (not Android) where this trick works when your tablet doesn't want to boot.

But there is a simple solution for that, which can take some time. Try to keep your device awake for as long as possible, even if that means you have to restart it a couple of times. Of course you do this while your charger is connected. After you have restarted it a couple of times, it should normally boot up. I expect it will take about 7 or 8 boots for the battery to be charged at minimum level again. After that, make sure you keep the device connected long enough so the battery is fully charged (have a look in your user manual how long it is recommended, most tablets need about 8 hours).

Another option is that your device just needs a little more juice to start. In that case you should leave it plugged in for some time (I recommend at least an hour) before booting.

4337,4337,6908,"How to prevent the ""Too awesome to use"" syndrome","When you give the player a rare but powerful item which can only be used once but is never really required to proceed, most players will not use it at all, because they are waiting for the perfect moment.

In the end, they will carry the item around until it is outclassed by other, more readily available resources, or even until the very end of the game. That means that such one-shot items don't provide any gameplay-value at all. They are simply too awesome to use.

There is already a lot of built-in SVG in Open Layers so this should be possible, but I haven't found a way to get this working in OL3. Is there some other way to do this in OL3 that I should consider?

Please note: we already tried using an ol.Vector layer, however when the user zooms in/out, the size of the SVG image grows/shrinks which is an inadequate workaround.



OL3 (fails): 

var createMapMarkerImage = function() {
    return function(feature, resolution) {
        var iconStyle = new ol.style.Style({
            image: new ol.style.Icon( ({
                src: 'img/map_pindrop.svg'   // OL3 doesn’t like this, but accepts a .PNG just fine
            }))
        });
        return [iconStyle];
    };
};


Very similar functionality, is the below example I found online, is almost perfect if it weren’t for the fact that the example uses OpenLayers-2 (OL2) functionality which calls openlayers.js library (instead of OL3’s ol.js library). Sadly, swapping these javascript files out fails.



OL2 (works -but is the old OL library):

Searching online for a solution to this seems to produce only other confused people searching for a solution.

17,17,23,Can you book hotels on a prepaid credit card worldwide?,"I tend to stay at smaller boutique hotels or local apartments when I visit a city but recently due to some credit card issues I will need to depend on prepaid Visa.  But I noticed when I try to shop online a lot of retailers don't accept prepaid credit cards so I'm thinking hotels would be even stricter.  Is there a list somewhere of countries or particular hotel chains than ban prepaid cards? If so, how does one book online or reserve a room without a card?  Do all hotels worldwide accept cash?
",verve,https://travel.stackexchange.com/users/2283,"TL;DR - Depends, on your pre-paid card, the hotel, and how you book the hotel.

There are a few different charges to consider here:


Pre-payment of the room at/shortly after booking
Holding the room on a flexible booking
Deposit at checkin
Room charge, meals, drinks, extras etc at checkout


With many OTAs and hotel websites, if you make a non flexible booking, or some kinds of flexible bookings, they will charge your card for the room rate during the booking process. With some others, they'll send your card details through to the hotel, who'll put it through their tills later. (Maybe that day, maybe during a weekly sweep). In order for this pre-payment to go through, your card will need to support offline / cardholder-not-present transactions. As long as your card advertises itself as ""suitable for online shopping"" or similar, and as long as the card issuer doesn't block travel booking, you should be fine. Speak to your card issuer to be sure.

Alternately, when reserving the room, you might opt for a flexible rate where you pay at checkout, with no pre-payment. This is typically offered on the hotel's own site, and some OTAs. They will normally ask for a credit card to ""hold"" the reservation, which would be charged in the event of a no-show, but as long as you turn up as planned the card won't be charged. These rates are normally a bit more expensive than non-flexible pre-paid ones, but this style of booking should be fine on any card.

At checkin, most hotels (but not all) will want to take some sort of deposit. Typically this covers any unpaid parts of the room rate, along with expected spend in the restaurant / bar / etc. The details taken would also be used in the event of damage. If you've pre-paid the room and don't plan to run up extras in the hotel, many hotels would let you not leave a deposit, but not all. Very small hotels may take a look at you, decide you look fine, and tell you to pay everything at checkout. Some hotels may want to take something no matter what.

For the deposit, this is normally done as a pre-authorisation. Not all pre-paid card support this, which would be a problem. Some pre-paid cards do support it, but badly, and might take a week or so to release the reserved funds, which could be a problem. Check with your card issuer about this. Alternately, many hotels which require a deposit will be willing to take a cash deposit, but they may well want a larger cash deposit than they'd normally authorise on a credit card. (They can't charge extras to the card later for example). Expect to leave a hefty chunk of cash as a deposit, expect checkin to take a while, expect several people to count the money, bills may be checked for counterfeits, and expect a receipt at the end. Speak with the hotel first to see if they need a deposit, and if they take cash ones. As a datapoint, I once got stuck in a checkin queue behind someone doing a cash deposit, he was asked to leave something like 4 nights room rate as a deposit on a 2 night stay.

Finally, we have settling up the bill at the end. If you pre-paid, and didn't eat there, you could well find there's nothing to pay, or just a few dollars / pounds / euros in city taxes. Alternately, if you didn't pre pay (or they didn't take it), ate in the restaurant lots etc, you could have a decent amount to pay here. You'll be present, so any card which supports in-person transactions will be fine for this. Well, as long as you have the money on it for the bill that is! If you did a cash deposit, you should get the choice between taking the bill off that and getting the remainder, or getting the whole deposit back in cash and paying on a card.

Oh, one more possibility - charges not noticed at checkout. Maybe you forgot to tell them about the minibar charges, maybe that morning's breakfast didn't go through, something like that. If you used a credit card for the deposit, expect them to charge it to that later when they notice. If you paid cash, expect to get a bill in the mail some time later.

Can it be done - sure! Can it be done at one specific hotel with one particular kind of pre-paid card on one specific rate booked one specific way? Depends...

2875,2875,4576,Asterisk for Small Business - Where to Start?,"I have been in IT for a long time now doing software development and some system/server administration, but all mostly software-related services.  I would like to help set up a small business (~50 employees) with Asterisk, but I am not very familiar with how the whole T1, data/voice channels, etc work.  I have set up a personal Asterisk server (functional), but have not done so with a pipe like a T1 (which sounds more complex than residential cable/DSL).

Are there any resources out there to help me understand what may be needed of me to help set this business up with Asterisk and re-use their existing T1 pipe?

Any help would be greatly appreciated.
",Benny,https://serverfault.com/users/42248,"Partial answer.

First, know that Asterisk configuration is more like a programming language than, say, Apache configuration. There are numerous ways to create ""nonsense"" configurations. On the other hand, you can create very nifty services.

There are three aspects to setting up an Asterisk installation:


call quality
what manner of phones will you be using?
which services do the users expect?


Quality

In my experience, your company suffers in reputation from bad phone lines, so make sure you get get decent quality from your installation. Quality is among other things: 


low upstream latency and high link uptime
Asterisk server uptime; use separate UPS. People tend to get cranky if they can't call the janitor and tell that there is a power failure in the house.
decent end-user equipment


Don't do a big bang implementation. Start with some users and work from there.

End user equipment

How are your users going to talk on the phone and how do you connect that equipment to Asterisk. Some users appreciate a headset connected to their PC, while others need a grey handset with analog dial pad or they will just be confused. Which will you provide and how will they connect to Asterisk?

For so called softphones (i.e. a SIP client installed on your PC) not much need to be done. You need a mechanism to handle accounts for these users (e.g. LDAP) and they need decent headsets. For connecting traditional analog phones, there are various sorts of equipment. For small installation, you may be able to get your hands on Zyxel Prestige 2002s (2 ports each), but for larger installations you need rack-mountable equipment of some sort.

Services

In my experience it is very difficult to get users to actually tell what they expect from a phone system, but once you give them something, they start having all sorts of opinions. So you need to be very clear about what services you provide and require a somewhat anal change management process (more so than is normally required in a small company).

Conclusion

This sounds dangerous and ominous, but know that the reward is equally great. The advantage of being able to create dedicated phone services, with the same sort of detailed control that you have with other IT services can be very rewarding. It will take some time for your users to get used to the thought that they can actually request fancy features from their phones, but once they get started, you can make their work a lot easier. Some features my users found very useful:


voice mail that sends mail with audio files
queues and fallback for all users
softphone and multiple phones for all users
phone conferences
redirection to mobile phones, and
routing calls through company phone system from private phones so that company picks up tab for international/expensive calls.


Also, traditionally, most phone extensions are personal, but in a modern company, most incoming calls are actually to a company function. You should probably consider not having personal extensions at all, and simply have an extension per function that rings all phones in that department/function.

   The First beat one of the most powerful ninjas in history (me), could heal himself without activating any special jutsu, could summon a freaking chakra sucking tree dragon.

   The Second had known (invented!!) Edo Tensei (meaning he could have broken free of Orochimaru's control), he also knew space-time ninjutsu.


With those abilities, plus immortality, they couldn't have possibly lost against the Third at their full power.

Ok i guess my first explanation was not good.
Retrieving through jquery a json and build a table is good, i could do that, but my request was more on the other part. 
I'm looking for a library to display the result in a special way.

Json request 2 send :

I would like the second row disapear with a effect (fadeOut) and the rows below move Up. For the row 5, i just want a new row appears with a fade in. 

Is that more clear ? 

Is there any livrary existing doing this ?

I'm doing it in PHP, but i hope to write all this in JS.

The user could just look the table and see the new rows appearing and the old rows deleting.

Any ideas or am i supposed to write it from scratch ?

The \@ifpackageloaded takes two arguments: what to do if the package is loaded or not. Your \if doesn't really do anything.

Edit: The question seems to have changed

Now the problem is that if the package is not loaded, then the macro \qw does not get defined. Something like this might be what you want

2341,2341,3731,What to do about students who ask for help too often?,"For my writing courses, about 5% of students will come to me prior to deadlines asking for help with their paper. I see no problem advising students, as I often similarly came for help when I was an undergraduate. Recently, though, I found an increase in students who apparently just want to abuse this:


Students will bring me some plagiarized work, showing it to me early, as a sort of test if I will notice. It seems difficult to punish plagiarism when the paper is not yet submitted.
Students will bring in papers again and again, with little changes put in at each stage, hoping their minimal effort each time will be sufficient to reach their goal of a ""D"".


I've tried stopping students, but then they are angry when they see the ""F"" that they hoped I would help them get away from. While most of these students are probably just incredibly lazy, there is a chance that some among them are genuinely trying to improve, but just struggling a great deal, and I can't see it.

How might I go about blocking such abuses?
",Village,https://academia.stackexchange.com/users/600,"Another strategy is to provide more guidance about what sort of help you'll provide and how they should ask for it. Possibilities:


The first time you bring your paper to my office [or during specific dates], we will focus only on whether you have answered the question.
I will be happy to discuss aspects X and Y, but never Z.
Bring the rubric with you. Be prepared to explain which part of the
rubric you most need to address in your draft, and why. We'll focus on that part   of the rubric during our meeting.
Before you bring your paper to me, prepare a list of specific questions you would like me to answer. Bring two copies of the list, one for each of us.
Before you bring your paper to me, show it to someone at the writing center. Bring with you your notes from that visit and the draft you showed to them, along with the draft where you implemented those suggestions.
Always bring two copies of your draft--one for each of us. Be prepared to write  detailed notes on your copy. (Then you can keep your copy and you'll be able to bring it out the next time and say--ok, what did you change? Or you can compare it to the draft they turn in to see if they made significant changes. And if they plagiarised it, you'll have a record.)
Each time you show me your paper, I will expect you to create a checklist of things you will address. The next visit, you need to demonstrate that you have completed those things by bringing a draft with changes marked and annotated.


Another thing you can do is assign ""draft"" deadlines as well as final deadlines for everyone, then give the feedback you think is important on the drafts (maybe using a rubric) and not meet incessantly with a few students.

Another thing you can do--particularly with very structured papers that you have assigned before--is provide to the class a list of the common problems students have. Then when a student shows you a draft, you can initiate a discussion about which common problem the student thinks it illustrates and what can the student do to address it?

Another thing you can do is limit the number of times you will look at a draft, or the period of time during which you will look at a draft. 

I have had a similar problem with students wanting me to grade work before they turn it in for a grade--not just on writing, but with all kinds of assignments. Sometimes they are so lost they are completely stuck. Other times, they seem to be trying to minimize their workload by increasing mine. (""Just tell me in exacting  detail what to do, I'll do that and no more, you'll give me an A."") But what I want is for them to learn how to assess their own writing! 

Whatever strategy you use, when you meet with students, try to elicit their comments. If you give a suggestion, and they nod, then ask them how they expect to apply it. What changes will they make to a particular sentence or paragraph? Are there any other places in the text they should also make that change to--which ones, and why? If they are to provide more evidence, ask them where they intend to search and how. Then you can better assess whether they understand what you've told them and whether they can actually do it.

I often ask students about how they produced the draft. Which parts were the easiest and which parts were the hardest, and why? Which parts do they like best? Which parts do they think need the most revision? Sometimes I ask them to imagine a reader--if they were to show their paper to (mom, roommate, employer, etc.), which part would be the most controversial? What would need the most explanation? If their reader disagrees, what would that person likely argue back? The more they talk about their writing, the more opportunity you have to say, ""Yes! What you just said--write that down. Now do that!"" 

Another benefit of getting students to talk about their draft is that it is tough to talk about something you didn't write. If they let you know they copied passages, you can remind them (or explain how) to cite them properly. If they pretend they wrote every word, you have a different problem to address.

@1X is a resolution (or rather, a process) in which many designers still design apps. Why? Because (and as many would have to agree) designing at such is much more tangible. I find it hard to explain why it’s so, but all I can say is that the content feels much more 1 on 1, it feels right so to speak, and the design is much more flexible to deal with, because of our “low” resolution computer displays that we’re designing them on.
Though that doesn’t mean we all like designing @1X. I’ve seen many others who build wonderful, beautiful apps designing at both processes (the other would have to be @2X — resolution of that of the Retina Display) and some say it feels much more comfortable for them having to have their content match perfectly without having to scale things up and tweak things around on the display.

4518,4518,7160,Simulating an automotive load dump with a bank of charged capacitors?,"I've been working on a data logging device that will eventually go into my personal vehicle.  I've scoured the interwebs and built what, in theory, should be a fairly stout power supply capable to handle fast transients and undervoltage and the fabled load dump.  My problem is, though... I want to actually test the power supply.

In previous questions that I've asked related to the design of the power supply portion, I've been told that the ""right way"" to simulate a load dump is with a proper, preofessional testing device.  I'm curious, though... what's stopping me from rigging up something that is ""close enough""?

My idea is simply this: get a low-voltage DC power source, such as an old PC power supply.  Get a DC-DC converter to step that 12V up to something in the 80V range.  Assemble a bank of capacitors to get me in the neighborhood of a theoretical 12V load dump..  which from what I can tell is in the hundreds of joules range.  Once charged, simply connect it to the battery input of the device - which wouldn't be connected to an actual power source lest I want to potentially screw that power source up - and see if explodes, and if not, see if it works normally afterwards.

Does this sound like the dumbest idea you've ever heard?  Is it a somewhat decent idea that simply needs a lot of planning and number checking to in order to work roughly as intended?
",Toby Lawrence,https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/9711,"A load dump is what happens to an automobile electrical system when a large load (such as the headlights) switches off. The problem is that the charging system (primarily the alternator) has significant inductance, and any attempt to rapidly reduce the current draw results in an ""inductive kick"" that creates a large voltage spike on the 12V bus. This kick is the same phenomenon used to create the spark in the ignition system, just a different manifestation of it. The point is, any equipment that's attached to the 12V bus needs to be able to withstand these occasional 100-200V voltage spikes without damage.

Since load dump is primarily an inductive phenomenon, it would probably be easier to simulate it that way, too. You don't really need to simulate the full energy of an actual automotive load dump; you just need to create the same voltage waveform across the supply terminals of your device.



Put a largish inductor (L1, on the order of 1H, perhaps the primary of a large power transformer) in series with your device (i.e., connect the device to the power supply through the inductor). This represents the inductance of the automobile charging system.

Put a few &micro;F of capacitance (C1) across (in parallel with) your device; this represents the distributed capacitance of the automobile wiring, and helps to limit the risetime of the load dump event. Make sure this capacitor is rated for a few hundred volts.

Put a 120&Omega; resistor (R1) in parallel with your device, too. This represents other static loads within the automobile, and will set an upper limit on the peak voltage that the load dump creates. (This resistor will be drawing 100 mA and dissipating 1.2W.)

Now, connect a low-value, high-power resistor (R2) across your device, in series with a switch (SW1). This represents the load that is going to get ""dumped"". The value of the resistor should be such that the DC current doesn't exceed the power supply's capability, and you can adjust the value of the resistor to change the current with respect to the value of the inductor to dump a specific amount of energy (0.5&times;I2&times;L). For example, if your inductor is 1H and your resistor is 12&Omega; (@ 12W), you'll be drawing 1A, and the stored energy will be 0.5 Joules.

Close the switch to ""charge up"" the inductor, then open it &mdash; there's your simulated load dump event. With these resistor values, the peak voltage will be on the order of 100-120V. You can use different combinations of resistor values to simulate different kinds of events. The ratio of R1 to R2 approximately determines the peak voltage of the spike (relative to the power supply voltage). Scale both resistors downward to simulate higher-current (higher-energy) events. Make the capacitor smaller to get faster risetimes; 1H and 1&micro;F resonate at 160Hz, which gives you a fairly leisurely 1.5ms risetime (1/4 cycle). For example, changing C1 to 0.01&micro;F would give you a risetime of about 150&micro;s.

1771,1771,2813,False positive Apache version in scanner results on Centos,"Recently I need to care a lot of false positive vulnerabilities in scanner results on Apache version.
Example of false positive vulnerability:

Apache 2.2 &lt; 2.2.16 Multiple Vulnerabilities


Our customers run scanners and they check Apache version related to the official Apache version numbering.

We use Centos, and the Apache version numbering is different from the official Apache version numbering.

For example now we install httpd-2.2.15-26.el6.centos.x86_64 and it includes all security patches released by Apache in recent versions.

The Centos Apache version numbering relies on the RedHat Apache version numbering and they do not change the base number (httpd-2.2.15) each update.
But scanners do not “understand” this and check that 2.2.15 &lt; 2.2.16.

Can you point me to the good document that explains the RedHat Apache version numbering?

Do you know if exist scanner that “understand” the RedHat Apache version numbering?
",Michael,https://security.stackexchange.com/users/24842,"What you're experiencing is a common problem.  Vulnerability scanners that rely upon service banners do not deal with vendors like Red Hat which backport security updates.  They are also prone to making assumptions about configuration that lead to false positives.

You may be able to improve the accuracy of the scan by running an credentialed scan.  If your scanner supports it, you can specify account credentials that it will use to log in and look at ""internal"" information.  For example, it can use 'rpm' to determine which actual Apache package is installed, and base its verdict upon that rather than the banner that the service prints to external scanners.  Such a scanner should have access to an up-to-date database that will tell it what the real issues are.

If your scanner won't do it, then the usual solution is to do it yourself.  You would need to look up whether you're running the newest version.  For example, @Rook points out that there are Apache vulnerabilities newer than the package you reference.  Looking at those vulnerabilities, you can pull the CVE ID and look it up in Red Hat's CVE Database. For example, their entry for CVE-2013-1862 points you to the errata RHSA-2013:0815 which says that httpd-2.2.15-28 contains fixes for that CVE.

Repeat that process for any other CVEs that you're concerned with and you can make an educated decision about whether you're patched despite what the banner says.  If the CentOS package is a direct correlation to the RHEL package, you should be fine - but the RHEL package was announced on 5/13, so I don't know how @Rook's cited 3/2 release date jibes with that.

WWII started roughly in 1939 with the invasion of Poland by Germany.  Rogers attempts to enlist in the US Army in 1940, however due to his frail physical state he is denied entry.

I created a sign that has an oval with scrolls and flowers in different colors on a field of turquoise.

Apparently this company did for much less and you can tell by the quality.

But here is my problem.  She had a jpeg that I allowed her to have so she could create her own fliers and I was ok with that since it would not have made me much if any money.

",KindDragon,https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/users/8399,"Generally most hardware doesn't suport 3-component texture formats so in this specific example you can make a reasonably safe assumption that it's converted.

For a more general case, glTexSubImage2D performance can give you a good indication of whether or not the upload must go through a software conversion path.  You'd go about this during program startup - just create an empty texture (via glTexImage2D with NULL data), then issue a bunch of glTexSubImage2D calls, each followed by a glFinish to ensure it completes.  Ignore the first one because caches/states/etc are being setup for it, and time the rest of them.  Repeat this for a few different formats and pick the fastest.

Another alternative - seeing as you've tagged this question ""Windows"" - is to create a D3D device at startup (just after you've created your window but before you init OpenGL) then use D3D to check for format support.  While OpenGL allows for software conversion to a valid internal format, D3D doesn't - if it's not supported by the hardware you can't do it.  Then destroy D3D and bring up OpenGL.

It's actually a useful rule of thumb to cross-check what you're doing in OpenGL with the D3D documentation.  If D3D can't do something then it can be a good indication that the something in question is not supported in hardware.  Not always true, but a useful starting place.

Indeed the limit is changed.
However, when I open another terminal and check the value, I still see zero value in core file size.

Questions:


Are changes made using ulimit command affect only current process, i.e. in this case the bash?
I launch a program from shell as a fore- or-background process. Does the ulimit change apply for new process ?
How can I make that all user processes are affected with this configuration ?

From man ulimit:

imposed on files written by the shell and its child processes (files of

increase the limit.


So, yes, child processes are affected.

To set limits permanently or for all processes, edit /etc/security/limits.conf and reboot. The examples in the manpage are fairly good. You just need to add something like:

4361,4361,6936,numpy float: 10x slower than builtin in arithmetic operations?,"EDIT:

I rerun the code under the Windows 7 x64 (Intel Core i7 930 @ 3.8GHz).

Again, the code is:

from datetime import datetime
import numpy as np

START_TIME = datetime.now()

# one of the following lines is uncommented before execution
#s = np.float64(1)
#s = np.float32(1)
#s = 1.0

for i in range(10000000):
    s = (s + 8) * s % 2399232

print(s)
print('Runtime:', datetime.now() - START_TIME)


The timings are:


float64: 16.1s
float32: 16.1s
float: 3.2s


Now both np floats (either 64 or 32) are 5 times slower than the built-in float. Still, a significant difference. I'm trying to figure out where it comes from.

EDIT:

Thank you for the answers, they help me understand how to deal with this problem.

But I still would like to know the precise reason (based on the source code perhaps) why the code below runs 10 times slow with float64 than with float.

EDIT:

numpy.float64 is 10 times slower than float in arithmetic calculations. It's so bad that even converting to float and back before the calculations makes the program run 3 times faster. Why? Is there anything I can do to fix it?

I want to emphasize that my timings are not due to any of the following:


the function calls
the conversion between numpy and python float
the creation of objects


I updated my code to make it clearer where the problem lies. With the new code, it would seem I see a ten-fold performance hit from using numpy data types:

from datetime import datetime
import numpy as np

START_TIME = datetime.now()

# one of the following lines is uncommented before execution
#s = np.float64(1)
#s = np.float32(1)
#s = 1.0

for i in range(10000000):
    s = (s + 8) * s % 2399232

print(s)
print('Runtime:', datetime.now() - START_TIME)


The timings are:


float64: 34.56s
float32: 35.11s
float: 3.53s


Just for the hell of it, I also tried:

from datetime import datetime
import numpy as np

START_TIME = datetime.now()

s = np.float64(1)
for i in range(10000000):
    s = float(s)
    s = (s + 8) * s % 2399232
    s = np.float64(s)

print(s)
print('Runtime:', datetime.now() - START_TIME)


The execution time is 13.28 s; it's actually 3 times faster to convert the float64 to float and back than to use it as is. Still, the conversion takes its toll, so overall it's more than 3 times slower compared to the pure-python float.

My machine is:


Intel Core 2 Duo T9300 (2.5GHz)
WinXP Professional (32-bit)
ActiveState Python 3.1.3.5
Numpy 1.5.1


END OF EDIT

ORIGINAL QUESTION:

I am getting really weird timings for the following code:

import numpy as np
s = 0
for i in range(10000000):
    s += np.float64(1) # replace with np.float32 and built-in float



built-in float: 4.9 s
float64: 10.5 s
float32: 45.0 s


Why is float64 twice slower than float? And why is float32 5 times slower than float64?

Is there any way to avoid the penalty of using np.float64, and have numpy functions return built-in float instead of float64?

I found that using numpy.float64 is much slower than Python's float, and numpy.float32 is even slower (even though I'm on a 32-bit machine).

numpy.float32 on my 32-bit machine. Therefore, every time I use various numpy functions such as numpy.random.uniform, I convert the result to float32 (so that further operations would be performed at 32-bit precision).

Is there any way to set a single variable somewhere in the program or in the command line, and make all numpy functions return float32 instead of float64?

There are two carboxylic acid functional groups, and there are two different pKa's.  This is because double deprotonation does not happen simulateneously.  One gets deprotonated first, then the other.  After the first deprotonation, the residual molecule has a negative charge.  The result:

The acid closer to the chlorine is more acidic because the chlorine is strongly electron withdrawing, and 'pulls' the electrons out of the carboxylate function, which then 'pulls' electrons away from the hydrogen, making it more acidic.  This effect decreases with distance, so the chlorine pulls on the acid function farther away less strongly.

In a more generalized way, remote groups will modify acidity because of electron withdrawing or donating effects, but the farther away from the acid function, the less effect there is.

For citric acid, there are actually two different flavors of acid function, so one of the kinds will be intrinsically more acidic before deprotonation because of the remove effect.  However, because of the sequential deprotonation discussed above, all three will have different pKa's

64,64,98,Existing proofs of Rokhlin's theorem for PL manifolds,"I'm looking for a comprehensive reference to  existing proofs of Rokhlin's theorem that a 4-dimensional closed spin PL manifold has signature divisible by 16.
I'm specifically interested in direct proofs (if any such exist) which do not rely on the fact that $\pi_i(PL/O)=0$ for small $i$.

The most commonly cited reference seems to be the book by  Kirby ""The Topology of 4-manifolds"". But the proof there is for smooth manifolds and I'm not sure why it works for PL manifolds although I've seen it claimed in various places that it does. The same is said about Rokhlin's original proof but I don't know why that's true either. I would also like to know if other proofs for PL manifolds exist. I'm particularly interested to know if there is a PL proof based on the Atiyah-Singer index theorem.       
",Vitali Kapovitch,https://mathoverflow.net/users/18050,"Another approach to the theorem that could probably be rewritten to work in the PL category is the approach of Kirby and Melvin in Appendix C of the following paper:

MR1117149 (92e:57011) 
Kirby, Robion(1-CA); Melvin, Paul(1-BRYN)
The 3-manifold invariants of Witten and Reshetikhin-Turaev for sl(2,C). 
Invent. Math. 105 (1991), no. 3, 473–545. 

See Corollary C6.

The idea of this approach is as follows.  There is a famous $\mathbb{Z}/2$-invariant of homology $3$-spheres called the Rokhlin invariant.  The usual definition of this invariant is as follows.  Letting $M^3$ be a homology $3$-sphere, there exists a compact spin $4$-manifold $W^4$ with $\partial W^4 = M^3$.  Let $\sigma$ be the signature of $W^4$.  Rokhlin's theorem implies that modulo $16$, the value of $\sigma$ is independent of $W^4$.  Since $\sigma$ is divisible by $8$ for number-theoretic reasons (namely, van der Blij's lemma about quadratic forms), the value of $\sigma/8$ is well-defined modulo $2$.  

Using the Kirby calculus, Kirby and Melvin give a $3$-dimensional'' construction of the Rokhlin invariant, avoiding all mention of $4$-manifolds.  They then go backwards and use this to prove Rokhlin's theorem about $4$-manifolds.

Looking at their proof, Kirby and Melvin use smoothness in two ways.  The first is to prove that the Rokhlin invariant is well-defined.  But this is harmless since (by work of Moise) all PL $3$-manifolds can be smoothed in a unique way.  The second use of smoothness is to obtain a handlebody decomposition of the $4$-manifold.  But this should be easier in the PL category!

They took two months to give me bupkes. But to give me bupkes, they were required to invoke a FOIA exemption, and the exemption that C.I.A. involved were (b)(3), which means the records are protected by another federal statute, and (b)(1) ---


Though I was unable to find the definition of “bupke” in OED (10th ed.), OALD (2000), and Collins Cobuild (4th ed.) at hand, I happened to find its definition at bageldrive.com, which says “bupke” is;

The Bagel Drive is ideal for storing files, photos, video, music and all of your digital tchochkes.　The site also shows photos of USB attached to plastic bagel models.


What does bupke mean? Is it a flash memory in a bagel shape as described in bagldrive com.? Does it pass as the generic term of flash memory?

Basically, I want to create a smart surface. I want to create a surface I can throw one or more tagged objects on that should all be recognized.

However, designing a circuit board and buying this IC is too expensive for our idea.

This one is rough. You can't punish someone due to plagiarism before they submit work. The best policy, in my opinion, is twofold. 

First - if a student brings plagiarized work then you should simply say ""I'm sorry, I cannot help you with work that is not your own."" and point to you university's policy regarding academic dishonesty. Repeat offenders should be put on notice.

Second - If you grade the final assignments or are involved consider spending a bit more time plagiarize-checking these particular student's submissions.

4348,4348,6923,Long Haul flight with 9 month old with potential no Bassinet,"I will be flying with my wife and daughter to the US and back again from New Zealand. Going there should be no issue, we should be able to use a bassinet but there is no guarantee we will get one on the flight back. We are flying Air New Zealand and they state that babies over 8 months could get a bassinet but if there are babies under 8 months they take priority, even if you request one well in advance.

So we won't know until we get to the airport whether we get a bassinet or not which will cause us an issue. An additional infant ticket is quite a lot and there is no guarantee there will be a free seat in case we get no bassinet.

So, what is the best way to handle this?

Bite the bullet and purchase a seat (we will have a car seat with us anyway) or hope there is a bassinet available?

Is there a third option where we have no additional seat and no bassinet? 13 hours on the lap is probably out of the question.

Looking at the different planes Air New Zealand uses (777 or 767 a priori on your route), there seems to be a minimum of 3 bassinets and up to 6, so I suppose you will likely have one - unless New Zealanders make way more babies than I have seen on flights in general.

Checking in early would probably help as you would get priority over other passengers for these seats.

2884,2884,4589,How do you give cells in a TableView a unique reference,"I'm still very new to iOS development, so bear with me. 

I've got a TableView using static cells to contain options (click to check), I am able to select the cells fine. I'd like to assign a value (identifier) to each cell, so that when a cell is selected or de-selected I can add/remove it from an array. Then, once the editing has finished, use the references stored in the array to update the respective CoreData attributes.

My google skills have failed me today, so a push in the right direction would be very much appreciated.

I'm going to be in a public area taking portraits of many people (for example, at a themed, public event, or while doing a 100 Strangers Project, etc..)

So, given all the pictures I take that day, how can I keep track of all the photos (matching up them up with their portrait, and then providing them a way to see/share the photo)? Also, what token, if any, could I give them to find or receive their photo later on?

Requirements

The ideal solution for me would


give them access to only their portrait
minimize the amount of personal information I get from them at the time of encounter (a name only, for example. The assumption is that people would not want to give out their contact information.)
minimize wasting their time (in other words, be a socially elegant solution)
maximize the amount of time I spend shooting while I'm out ""in the field"" as opposed to bookkeeping


I'm comfortable giving them my contact information.

245,245,393,InstallHandler runs under a special ghost user. What rights does it have?,"When you install a managed package with a post-install script, Salesforce creates a special ghost user under which all of the post install activities occur. I think this is undocumented. Here are some details.

This can be great from an audit point of view (you can see which package has 'touched' all the data). But can problematic in several examples:


Certain objects are inaccessible by SOQL (I've found CronTrigger and ApexClass so far)
Scheduled Jobs (and any code they call) will forever run under the post-install context,
Batch Jobs execute as the post-install user and suffer the same issues above,


I've tried querying the user by id in SOQL to no avail, and the debug log monitor don't record anything.

How crippled is this special ghost user? Does he have a documented profile?

850,850,1356,"How to prevent the ""Too awesome to use"" syndrome","When you give the player a rare but powerful item which can only be used once but is never really required to proceed, most players will not use it at all, because they are waiting for the perfect moment. But even when this moment comes, they will still be reluctant to use it, because there might be an even better moment later. So they keep hoarding it for a moment which will never come. 

In the end, they will carry the item around until it is outclassed by other, more readily available resources, or even until the very end of the game. That means that such one-shot items don't provide any gameplay-value at all. They are simply too awesome to use.

What can you do to encourage the player to make use of their one-shot items and not hoard them?
",Philipp,https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/users/21890,"I think looking at it from the ""this item is too powerful"" point of view is missing the point a bit.  In my view, it's more about hoarding items because they're limited.  A good example of this problem happening is in a game like Skyrim where you can make potions.  Sure, 5% fire resist for 5 seconds isn't terribly powerful by almost anybody's standards, but it still accumulated to the point where I didn't want to get rid of them because 1) they were a limited amount and 2) I couldn't predict the future.

So that being said, I would look at the problem as a way to mitigate hoarding behavior.

One of the most successful approaches I've seen is to take the items away from the player at known intervals.  For example, make it so you get consumables inside dungeons, but once you leave the dungeon the consumables go away.  That way, the item can't be hoarded because it isn't permanent. Since you don't have persistent consumable inventory beyond the dungeon, the user doesn't feel that the item has as much value. 

Alternatively, you could also do things like dramatically limit the number of single use items the player can carry.  The logic being that if you don't use the items you're leaving a bunch of consumables behind.  It isn't as good an approach as forcing the items out of the user's inventory, but it might also encourage the user to churn through their items.

Sure, 5% fire resist for 5 seconds isn't terribly powerful by almost anybody's standards, but it still accumulated to the point where I didn't want to get rid of them because 1) they were a limited amount and 2) I couldn't predict the future.

So that being said, I would look at the problem as a way to mitigate hoarding behavior.

One of the most successful approaches I've seen is to take the items away from the player at known intervals.  For example, make it so you get consumables inside dungeons, but once you leave the dungeon the consumables go away.  That way, the item can't be hoarded because it isn't permanent. Since you don't have persistent consumable inventory beyond the dungeon, the user doesn't feel that the item has as much value. 

Alternatively, you could also do things like dramatically limit the number of single use items the player can carry.  The logic being that if you don't use the items you're leaving a bunch of consumables behind.  It isn't as good an approach as forcing the items out of the user's inventory, but it might also encourage the user to churn through their items.

250,250,404,What are the pitfalls of buying a used car after an accident?,"I have the option to buy a car that has been in an accident. There are alternatives, but within my budget the alternatives are usually older/have higher mileage. The seller is a local mechanic who did the restoration work and also showed pictures of the car before restoration. The damage was done to one of the front headlights and to the surrounding bits. The mechanic has convinced me that no damage was done to the internal carrying structure. He fixed the lights and did some paintwork restoration.

Problem: I read that people advice not to buy cars after the accident. This is my first car, so my experience is nonexistent.

Question: What are the cons against buying a car after the accident?

",JimD,https://mechanics.stackexchange.com/users/3196,"For what it's worth, I bought my first car (well, first that was actually mine) shortly after college for $100 with accident damage. Started with no knowledge or experience repairing cars. Took me a few months to get it in working shape, but it served me well for 4 years, and I learned a lot from it. However, it had damage to the frame that kept me from ever getting the alignment perfect, and so it burned through tires. This is something you might want to have checked by a professional on any vehicle that's had accident damage.

Anyway, the main thing I have to add on top of what others have said is that, if you can't afford to spend a lot of money and want to buy a car with potential problems as a way to save money, you might want to go the way I did and take ""accident damage"" over ""engine problems"". Even if you have to do some work on it later yourself, replacing components that might have been damaged in an accident is a lot easier for a beginner than doing a head gasket job or full engine or transmission rebuild (those issues being the other obvious ways you could get a dirt-cheap vehicle).

2729,2729,4350,How does sulfuric acid dehydrate sugars?,"I know sugars have $\ce{-OH}$ groups, and that sulfuric acid is a strong acid. What I'm failing to see is how exactly sulfuric acid dehydrates sugars. Does it protonate the hydroxyl groups, making them good leaving groups? What about the case of sucrose? 



For example, how are the oxygens ""taken care of"" by the sulfuric acid? Are they doubly protonated? Is there some established mechanism for the dehydration of sugars by sulfuric acid, because I can't find any - I just find general equations and I've looked on Google and through textbooks. 

After some further research I learned that the gas, sulfur dioxide, is evolved. This suggests to me that this reaction is also redox in nature. So is this reaction both an acid-base reaction and a redox reaction? Sulfur in sulfuric acid has an oxidation state of +6; sulfur in sulfur dioxide has an oxidation state of +4. Plus the elemental carbon formed has an oxidation state of 0 while in sucrose, carbon has various oxidation states.

5993,5993,9501,Group isomorphisms and a possible trivial statement?,"I have the following set $G=\lbrace a,b,e \rbrace$ and I successfully computed the following Cayley-Table \begin{align} \begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
\circ&amp; a &amp; b &amp; e \\ \hline
 a&amp; b&amp;e &amp;a\\ \hline
 b&amp; e &amp;a &amp;b\\ \hline
 e&amp;  a&amp; b&amp;e\\ \hline
\end{array} \end{align}

Now $(G, \circ)$ forms a group. When talking about homomorphisms I learned that a mapping is considered a homomorphism if $\varphi: G \to G'$ is a mapping such that $\forall a,b \in G, \varphi(a \circ b) = \varphi(a) \circ' \varphi(b)$.

So I was asked to show that the group $(G, \circ)$ of order 3 is isomorph to the group $(G', \circ ')$ where $G' = \lbrace c,d,e' \rbrace$. So what I did was define the mapping \begin{align} \varphi: \begin{cases} &amp;G \longrightarrow G' \\ &amp;a \longmapsto c \\&amp;b \longmapsto d \\ &amp;e \longmapsto e' \end{cases} \end{align}

So it is trivial to notice that $\varphi$ is bijective. It also follows easily (I've done the calculations) that $\varphi$ is homomorphism, using the same Cayley table as above and replacing all letters by $c,d,e'$ respectively. Therefore $\varphi$ is an isomorphism. 



My question now is, what have I done? If this approach was even remotely correct, then I wonder what my statement now is saying. I have found an isomorphism between $G$ and $G'$ and therefore they have the same structure. But I defined them from the beginning as groups of the same order and even used the same Cayley-table. 

The only relevance I can see in this is that I made no statement about $c,d,e'$ at all, so I never said that they must be equal or even related to $a,b,e$.

To really hit the point home about my confusion and the triviality I see in what I have done let me get a bit more verbal. I consider the Cayley table above as regular grid, or as some sort of game in which for whatever reasons the field are labeled just as above. Now I meet my friend and replace the abstract letters $a,b,e$ by $c,d,e'$ and tell him, ""look, game 1 and game 2 have the same structure!""... well, yes?

In CodeIgniter, how or where can I declare an array that will be accessible in the router (CI_Router), in my custom controller and in the view loader (CI_Loader)? I want to avoid hard-coding data in the router and specifying the same data more than once (in the router and in the controller and/or view).

(Explanation follows; perhaps there is a better way to do what I'm trying to do.)

I have a site where I publish my freeware apps. The site is all static, but maintaining plain html by hand is a nightmare, so I'm trying to use CodeIgniter to generate the pages dynamically. Apart from a few loose ends like 'welcome' or 'contact info', the bulk of the site consists of highly structured application sections. Each app has the same set of pages: about, download, screenshots, etc. These pages all have the same exact layout and only differ in contents.

My main concern is maintainability and the amount of work that required to add a new app (or a new page for all apps). I see no reason to use multiple controllers (or even multiple views), because the only difference is in data (application identifiers), not in behavior or page layout.

My problem is with routing. I could do something like

$route['app1'] = 'main/apps/app1';
$route['app2'] = 'main/apps/app2';


...or loop over an array of app identifiers, but that seems really bad. When I add an application, I should not have to modify the router, since it's just another identifier added to a list, that will be used to pick page contents from an appropriate file.

What I would like to do instead is (pseudocode):

foreach (app in list_of_apps) {
  foreach (app_page in list_of_pages) {
    route['app/app_page'] = 'main/index/app/app_page'
  }
}


This would take care of all requests for 'app1/download' or 'app2/screenshots', etc. So where can I declare the arrays $list_of_apps and $list_of_pages so that they are visible in the router, in the controller, and later in view as well?

3260,3260,5198,Is it possible to encrypt a file so that it can not be brute forced?,"Is there any program or method that allows encryption that can not be brute forced or is it just that any encrypted file can be decrypted by brute force?
",user43351,https://security.stackexchange.com/users/43351,"The difficulty of brute forcing an encryption system is based on the degree of randomness produced by the key.  When a key is less than the length of a file, there has to be some type of reuse, and this means less than perfect randomness and thus some small susceptibility to being brute forced.

Thus, in order to make something truly brute force proof against an attacker with unlimited resources and time, the only option is a truly random key that is the same length as the input and that has never been used as a key on another message.  This technique is actually very, very old and is known as a one time pad (or OTP).  An OTP is completely future secure as long as the key remains secret.  Since the key is random and only used once, the input bears no resemblance to the output and ""jfeidj"" could just as easily be ""attack"" as it could be ""dinner"".

That said, attackers don't have unlimited time or resources, so practically speaking, almost any modern symmetric algorithm will provide more than enough security even at key lengths as low as 128 bits or lower.  128 bit AES, for example, while ""technically"" able to be brute forced would take so long trying to brute force that chances are good that if every computer on the planet worked on nothing but cracking the message, the sun would die and the solar system get sucked in to a black hole before they finished cracking the message.

When a key is less than the length of a file, there has to be some type of reuse, and this means less than perfect randomness and thus some small susceptibility to being brute forced.

Thus, in order to make something truly brute force proof against an attacker with unlimited resources and time, the only option is a truly random key that is the same length as the input and that has never been used as a key on another message.  This technique is actually very, very old and is known as a one time pad (or OTP).  An OTP is completely future secure as long as the key remains secret.  Since the key is random and only used once, the input bears no resemblance to the output and ""jfeidj"" could just as easily be ""attack"" as it could be ""dinner"".

That said, attackers don't have unlimited time or resources, so practically speaking, almost any modern symmetric algorithm will provide more than enough security even at key lengths as low as 128 bits or lower.  128 bit AES, for example, while ""technically"" able to be brute forced would take so long trying to brute force that chances are good that if every computer on the planet worked on nothing but cracking the message, the sun would die and the solar system get sucked in to a black hole before they finished cracking the message.  (Provided there aren't any unknown flaws in the algorithm and that the key is properly generated.)  If you make it 256bit, the heat death of the universe will come before you successfully brute force it.

Flip the bike on it's back and spin the cranks slowly. If it is a freewheel pedal, it backwards since this will not engage the sprocket. If it is a coaster, you will have to pedal it forwards. If you notice the chain get really tight then loose as you do this, adjust your chain. Find the same spot the pedals are at where it gets the tightest and loosen then tighten the rear wheel with the cranks in the same spot so that the tightest it will get is where you just set it.

If the chain tension was not the problem, you might need to check the bearings. Huffys almost never have sealed bearings and they can be over under tightened, either being a problem.

If a person has cancer could this somehow alter the person's immune system so it doesn't function effectively to detect greatly mutated cells?

",201044,https://biology.stackexchange.com/users/11605,"Great question and in part, you are correct. However, you must also remember that this greatly depends on what genes have undergone mutation. 

In the case of cancer, it's usually either a gene that regulates cell proliferation rates, induces programmed cell death or helps to repair damaged DNA. When one (or all) of these genes is mutated, the cell constantly proliferates and/or does not die when it is ""programmed"" to do so or cannot repair mutations to it's DNA, thus creating a cancerous tumor.

Now, on to the immune system. The reason a persons immune system does not target and kill it's own cells is because of a certain set of genes that is specific to each and every person called Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC). These genes encode specific cell surface molecules that the immune system cannot produce antibodies to bind to because they are ""locked"", if you will (see, the immune has a sort of built-in list of genes that code for antibodies that bind to different sequences of molecules (that's how you develop immunity and fight pathogens), the genes that code for the specific molecules that your cells have on their surface are just not on that list.) In order for a person's immune system to recognize cancerous cells as a pathogen and destroy them, the cancer cell's MHC genes would also need to be mutated drastically.

For instance, breast cancer is usually caused by a mutation in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes. These genes assist in DNA repair. Even if this mutation happens, these cells still have the same MHC as the rest of the cells in your body because BRCA1 and BRCA2 don't really have much to do with MHC. Because of this, the immune system does not recognize the cancerous cells as a threat and is unable to destroy or even detect them.

",user2082226,https://ux.stackexchange.com/users/27595,"So, I wish I had the time to sketch this out but I'll see if I can describe it. First off, you're going to need more than just a table.

The student information is the parent of all the other. Have that be the head section of your page, it should stay constant and as the main ""breadcrumb"" of the data. Then, use the semesters (if you're tracking years, use those first) as containers for the classes.

For the semesters, you could use tabs. Under the student information you could tab across each semester to see the class listing. This could be a table list view or an accordion. There are lots of options here.

From the list view, I would have a detail view that you could bring in with a number of different interactions for the assignments (modals, accordions, etc). Depending on if the assignments are actionable or not; are they an archive of completed assignments or a way to get to current assignment information? That would change how you show them I think.

I know that's hard to process in words, so I'd take a look at other UI that's have similar issues. Ones that come to mind are project tracking or high-end todo list apps. I'd look at those and see what patterns they use to help guide you. @Michael Lai also had great advice about grabbing paper and pencil and quickly starting to explore ideas.

3989,3989,6367,Why does this sequence converges to $\pi$?,"One of my daughters was having a small programming exercise. 

Let's consider following algorithm:


Take a list of length $n$: $\ (1\,\ 2\,\ \ldots\,\ n)$.
Remove every $2$nd number.
From the resulting list, remove every $3$rd number.
From the resulting list, remove every $4$th number.
... Follow on until the list remains unchanged and let $u_n$ be the number of remaining elements.


Example with $n=11$


$(\ 1\,\ 2\,\ 3\,\ 4\,\ 5\,\ 6\,\ 7\,\ 8\,\ 9\,\ 10\,\ 11\ )\quad \Rightarrow\quad (\ 1\ *\ 3\ *\ 5\ *\ 7\ *\ 9 \ *\ 11\ )$

5113,5113,8132,How do I deal with a slow and undedicated colleague in the team?,"I have been working on a new project. The project works like this: The end user can access a webapp using a link and he can add multiple systems on his network and manage that particular systems details. My part involves the front end and the webserver, which is done in python. My python actually communicates with another project which is entirely done in c &amp; c++. The c/c++ project is the main app which does all the functionality. My python sends the user request to it and displays the response from it to the user. 

I am very familiar with my work and I will finish it soon. Since that's not much work in it. And I am a person who loves to work. I spends most of the time in office and only go home when I feel sleepy.

The c/c++ app is managed by another colleague who has 5+ year experience and can do things much faster than me, but he never does it. May be he doesn't like to do it. His app crashes often when my python communicate with it or returns wrong values. It's full of bugs. Since my app depends on it, I am having a hard time building it. Instead of fixing the bugs, he asks me to slow down my work. He asks me to tell manager that my work needs a lot of time. He is asking me to fool the manager and even forcing me to work slowly like him.

During project meeting, when manager asks him about the bugs he says that he fixed everything and it works fine. Since he is my colleague, I couldn't tell anything to the manager. I obviously need to have a good relationship with my colleagues more than my manager, since most of the time we will be with our colleagues, not with the manager.

I am not able to tell the manager anything regarding this, since if manager asks him why, then he may think I complained about him to the manager. And he keeps on lying in the meeting. And since he fixes the bug slowly, it even slows down my work. Now I thought of working on the front-end part of my app  and finishing it off so that in the mean time he can make his project stable. Now he is asking me to tell the manager that my front end part require a lot of work and I may need more and more time, simply so that he can drag the project down. And the sad thing is our actual manager has gone to the US, so we have a temporary manager and this guy doesn't know about the project much, so the c,c++ just fools him.

Can anyone suggest me how I deal with this?
I wanted to finish off the project soon. How can I make him work even by maintaining a good relationship with him?

Responses to comments:


  If he's really deliberately misleading the company, you should report him to management.


I am new to this company and the other guy has been there for many years. And I have just started knowing my colleagues. If I directly go and complaint him, I don't think so I can make good relationship with my other colleagues. Even he has the power to mislead them. I am not telling he is a bad guy, he can do the work, but he is not doing it.


  Doesn't your company have any kind of bug tracking system ? 


Here actual bug tracking system isn't there. The company tries to finish off the project as soon as possible and gives it to the QA. And then fixes the bugs reported by QA. 


  This is why companies should give employees stock / options or some sort of ownership. That way you can literally tell the guy ""You are costing me monetary growth... don't you want to make money also?"".


The company has the stock options they have given me a 2500 share, mostly he too would have got some more.


  Seniority does deserve some benefit of a doubt. You really need to speak to him first and try to understand the problem. He may be out of his depth, you may be able to help him, there could easily be variables you are unaware of. It may be hard now, but you could easily make the situation a lot worse by jumping the gun. 


I even does it, first his app wasn't handling multiple requests at a time, he was using a queue to handle the requests I sent to him. I even suggested to him some of my ideas on it. He said he already had these ideas, and will be executing them. His explanations was: ""Everything require certain time to do and this is a project which may need two years to complete and we are asked to finish it in two months"". I used to have a hard time coding during first few weeks because of this bug. But now he fixed it. But he is using a single queue for a user requests and that is now slowing down the app, since it processes one request at a time.


  What is QA doing this whole time? Why aren't they reporting/confirming the status of the project(s)? 


The manager is the person who decides when to give to the QA. As of now it has not yet given to QA. He said we should give it by this month end.

You absolutely can and should make sure your manager knows the truth, even if your co-worker is lying to his face. If you don't want to say anything in a meeting with all 3 of you in the room, that's totally understandable. But you should at least pull your manager (the real one, not just the temp) aside and let them know that your work is almost done and is waiting on bug fixes from the other developer's end before the whole application is ready for prime-time. Don't accuse your co-worker of lying, but don't sit there and let your boss operate with incomplete information. 

Report your statuses honestly. If your work is being held up by bugs on another developer's end, document that you've found bugs in the C/C++ and have reported them (please tell me you're using some form of documentation that leaves a paper trail). 

In the meantime, go ahead and wrap up your work, and let your boss know when you're done. If your manager wants to know why the rest of the project isn't up and running yet, you can refer him to the other developer, and maybe mention that it's probably very complicated/large/requires a lot of testing/other developer is very busy/etc. If you know C/C++, you can offer to help on the main application logic to get things moving with that as well. Yes, you'll be doing the other guy's work, but it makes it clear that you're the employee working hard and being productive, and the other guy isn't, not to mention making you even more valuable to your boss. It may even put some pressure on the other developer to step things up and get them done quicker.

If you draw a cloister tile in the beginning of the game, it will typically still require an investment of quite a bit of ""meeple"" time to obtain the full 9 points, which makes it a fair trade-off. However, after about half of the game, it's relatively likely that you can ""parachute"" a cloister tile in some spot and get 8 or 9 points immediately. This adds a lot of randomness to the game.

What house rules work well to diminish this effect?

You don't get the points until all the surrounding squares are filled, which is a safe bet in 'vanilla' Carcassonne, but not such a sure thing with expansions.

The Catapult expansion makes it possible to remove Meeple from the board, or replace them with your own. The Princess and the Dragon expansion also encourages Monk removal as dragon-food.

You could ban the 'instant cloister' case, disallowing the dropping of a cloister into a hole for an immediate 9 points. I personally don't find this a huge problem though.

143,143,227,System for Setting: Misfits,"On the recommendation of one of my players, I'm watching Misfits, a British TV show about kids (Their ages aren't so far specifically stated; they're old enough to drink and young enough to live at home, so late-teens to early 20s, I guess) serving community-service sentences who get super powers. The recommendation included an explicit desire for me to run a game like this.

I'm watching it and thinking about what system to run it in. I want to ask this question more clearly than my last system-for-setting question, so here are some specific points to consider when answering:

WARNING! Spoilers Below!

If you haven't watched the series but plan to, you might not want to read what follows. I tried to separate setting spoilers from the system requirements, but it just didn't work.


The world is gritty and the power level is relatively low. It reminded me of Wild Cards, with ""the storm"" as the catalyzing event. Therefore, the system must support fine gradations in power - the scale is pretty low, so a small advantage needs to be representable.
Powers are uncontrollable - at least at first. Alisha's lust-inspiring power is uncontrolled as far as I have watched, and the immortality power (obviously) works without conscious effort. Curtis' time rewind is a power of huge significance, but it's not controlled by the beginning of the second season either. Therefore the system must support uncontrolled and unreliable powers.
The system you recommend must support regular humans as significant combat threats - Sally gave Simon a real fight. Player character death must be a real possibility.
This is also an ensemble drama, like Buffy, and much of the story is about the changing relationships between the characters.


When answering, please include only one system per answer to facilitate voting.

In your answer please address the following:


How that system fits the given criteria
What special or unique features of the system are particularly suited to driving this style of play


I will not accept answers along the lines of, ""You can do this (or anything) in any system"". They will be downvoted and / or flagged for deletion. This question presupposes that System Does Matter.

GURPS PCs are easy to kill if you're using things like hit location and the bleeding rules -- I haven't seen anything in the show that wouldn't be straightforward just using the rules as written. (GURPS did Wild Cards and the two are quite similar in terms of mechanics -- normal people who also have powers. Unless one of your powers is ""being bulletproof"", you're going to have to worry in a fight with normals.) Unfortunately with regular GURPS, it is not possible for players to die.

Here is a screenshot of the exact message:


This happened on both my Lubuntu machine and Kubuntu machine, and it wasn't a problem until after I upgraded; so I suspect that it was not user error.

How can I fix this?

UPDATE

I have tracked this down to my .bashrc file, which is getting called by my .profile file.  Though, the fact that my .bashrc file now runs when I do a GUI login whereas it didn't before I upgraded is a bit weird.  And no, I haven't modified my .bashrc file or my .profile recently.  Also, bash isn't my default shell.

The problem is that I am calling tput in my .bashrc file to set up variables for use in adding color to the prompt.  But at the (inappropriate) time when my .bashrc file now gets run, $TERM is not set.

Updated question: How should I fix this?  Should I set $TERM myself?  Or should I just not set these variables if $TERM is not set?

One solution I tried was to check whether $TERM was set. But this didn't seem to work; I still got the same error message.  Here's the code:

I seem to have hazy memories that a Wild Cantor didn't interact particularly well with cards with Convoke, so I was wondering if it was a similar story here...
",thesunneversets,https://boardgames.stackexchange.com/users/436,"From my interpretation, it should work.


  601 Casting Spells
  
  601.2e The player determines the total cost of the spell. Usually this is just the mana cost. Some spells have additional or alternative costs. Some effects may increase or reduce the cost to pay, or may provide other alternative costs. Costs may include paying mana, tapping permanents, sacrificing permanents, discarding cards, and so on. The total cost is the mana cost or alternative cost (as determined in rule 601.2b), plus all additional costs and cost increases, and minus all cost reductions. If the mana component of the total cost is reduced to nothing by cost reduction effects, it is considered to be {0}. It can't be reduced to less than {0}. Once the total cost is determined, any effects that directly affect the total cost are applied. Then the resulting total cost becomes ""locked in."" If effects would change the total cost after this time, they have no effect.
  
  601.2f If the total cost includes a mana payment, the player then has a chance to activate mana abilities (see rule 605, ""Mana Abilities""). Mana abilities must be activated before costs are paid.
  
  Example: You cast Altar's Reap, which costs {1}{B} and has an additional cost of sacrificing a creature. You sacrifice Thunderscape Familiar, whose effect makes your black spells cost {1} less to cast. Because a spell's total cost is ""locked in"" before payments are actually made, you pay {B}, not {1}{B}, even though you're sacrificing the Familiar.


So first you determine and lock the mana cost, then you can activate mana abilities, then you have to pay the mana cost.

As for the definition of a Mana Ability:


  
  Mana Abilities
  
  
  605.1a An activated ability is a mana ability if it meets three criteria: it doesn't have a target, it could put mana into a player's mana pool when it resolves, and it's not a loyalty ability. (See rule 606, ""Loyalty Abilities."")


The cantor meets all 3 criteria, so its ability is a mana ability. Therefore, you should gain both the cost reduction and the mana through saccing.

As for why a cantor should not play nicely with Convoke, I don't know - do you have an authoritative source that it really doesn't work? ""Tapping a creature"" is an optional, additional cost by Convoke, and after tapping for convoke you should still be able to sac the Cantor with its mana ability.

Here is an explanation why the cantor can only reduce convoke spells by 1. However, that does not affect my answer to your actual question. The subtle difference between the two is that Blasphemous Act has a cost reduction, which is locked after you determined it. Convoke, OTOH, offers an alternative way of paying the mana costs and requires you to tap creatures to pay for its cost. You can announce to tap the cantor, but once you sacced it for mana, you can of course no longer do so, and the game rewinds to before you announced Blasphemous Act.

4971,4971,7918,Drywall - final joint compound coat,"While remodeling an older house (where nothing is quite straight) we used fiber glass mesh joint tape and 3 coats of joint compound. The first coat was applied with a 4 inch knife, the second with an 8 inch and ending the third on a 12 inch knife. I can still see the texture from the mesh tape I used on some of the joints.

I hoped that a coat of primer would level it off, but after using Kilz 2 primer I can still see the tape in some spots. :(

Sanding through the primer now proves difficult (doesn't work) with a medium grit sanding block.

Should I add another coat? I could never quite get the joint compound to adhere over the mesh tape. I've always been taught to go as thin as I can on the joint compound to reduce the sanding part. Did I go too thin? 

I'm hoping a second coat of primer and 2 coats of the final latex paint hides it, but I know this isn't the right answer. How can I fix this?



following what doresoom and shirlock said; i just applied a coat with the 12 inch knife practically against the wall (accidentally touching the wall with the handle once or twice) - more or less dragging the compound across the surface

this produced the result explained - about 1/32nd ? thickness of mud, covering the tape that i'll need to feather round the edges

i miss spoke earlier - i was using a sponge sanding block (not strait paper sand paper)

now that the primer has dried (did it saturday) its not as bad as i thought it was, but this is the right way to do it (not covering it with paint)

just as a side, we've used sherwin williams paint throughout the house and although its great paint (IMO) the plaster and lath walls that remain, even those repairs show through - and if those do, than this new work will... may as well do finish it right...

thanks for the help guys - i'll check this coat tomorrow and give a last one with the soap and water if it needs it.
",lsiunsuex,https://diy.stackexchange.com/users/1154,"As the others have said, paint will not help your situation.  You will need to apply another coat of mud. The final coat can be applied using a 12 inch flat knife, but I personally like a 14 or 16 inch bow trowel. The idea is to have a thicker coat of mud over the tape and bevel or feather the edges out wide so you will not notice the small difference in thickness.  With a 12 inch knife, your joint should be about 16 to 18 inches wide. Push harder on the outside of the knife than on the inside/center of the joint. This will leave more mud in the center and feather the edges better. Do this on each side of the joint. 

Here is another tip for you.  For your last or final touch-up coat, mix a little extra water and some Ivory dish soap into your mud.  It will flow very easily, far less tiny air bubbles, and will sand out easy with little pressure. Never use sandpaper, use a 150 or 220 sanding sponge.

4416,4416,7015,What technique/sensor can I use to recognized tagged objects thrown onto a surface?,"I am trying to implement a concept for somebody else. 

Basically, I want to create a smart surface. I want to create a surface I can throw one or more tagged objects on that should all be recognized. 

I am unsure how to this and what sensors I should use. I have been thinking about using one of the NFC ICs from NXP. However, designing a circuit board and buying this IC is too expensive for our idea. I'm also unsure of whether the surface area will cause problems, because it'll be quite large (think of a small coffee table). 

I've also been thinking about other ways to recognize objects, but I have not come up with anything yet. I am probably not using the correct term. 

Does anyone know of a type or sensor or technique to implement this? 

Note: I am a computer engineer, not an electrical engineer. I know the basics, but really not much more than that, so I prefer a solution that is available as a simple IC or a complete circuit board with the really complicated things done for me by the experts :) 
",Pascal Muller,https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/16149,"Look for RFID tags, and RFID sensors.

This RFID reader from SparkFun has a built-in antenna and a range of 200 mm and works with inexpensive 125 KHz RFID tags. Also, SparkFun has this USB RFID adapter to connect to a reader such as above, and provide USB data read off the tags directly to your computer or other device.

If you need to span a large area such as a coffee table, your options are: RFID reader with external antenna port, or a number of integrated antenna RFID readers arranged around the periphery of the surface

The mechanism used in some department stores, for instance, has their items tagged with RFID tags, and RFID antenna loops 3-5 feet tall and about a foot wide, on either side of the exit doors. The range is a few feet, which should serve the purpose. In your case, such an antenna would be a suitable loop of wire around the periphery of the surface.

This RFID reader from SparkFun has a built-in antenna and a range of 200 mm and works with inexpensive 125 KHz RFID tags. Also, SparkFun has this USB RFID adapter to connect to a reader such as above, and provide USB data read off the tags directly to your computer or other device.

If you need to span a large area such as a coffee table, your options are: RFID reader with external antenna port, or a number of integrated antenna RFID readers arranged around the periphery of the surface

The mechanism used in some department stores, for instance, has their items tagged with RFID tags, and RFID antenna loops 3-5 feet tall and about a foot wide, on either side of the exit doors. The range is a few feet, which should serve the purpose. In your case, such an antenna would be a suitable loop of wire around the periphery of the surface.

",Benzo,https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/users/2997,"Youll run into two types of metallic pads- sintered metallic and semi-metallic. The term ""metallic"" without any modifier gets used for a couple of reasons- a) many manufacturers don't offer both varieties of metallic pads for a given brake, so the type is implicit, and b) lots of folks don't know the difference or think the terms are interchangeable. They are similar, but different:

Sintered metallic pads offer the best stopping power, but also cause the most rotor wear and can make the most noise, especially when wet. They are also the least affected by adverse conditions. Sintered metallic are typically used in downhill/freeride applications, but can be used for less demanding riding types as well. Depending on the setup, sintered pads can feel ""grabby"", that is, that they lack modulation at the lever. That problem tends to arise on more powerful brakes with larger rotors though, and both of those factors play towards that perception.

Semi-metallics are a tradeoff between braking performance and pad wear/noise. They still stop very well but can be a little less noisy and cause a little less rotor wear. They may also offer better lever modulation than sintered metallic pads. This pad type can often be found on higher end all-mountain, trail, and cross country oriented brakes, though some manufacturers opt for sintered pads while others may opt for organics.

Organic pads are the kindest to your rotors and typically quitest, but don't offer the same bite as metallic pads. These pads also wear the quickest. This does not mean that they're low end pads though, and depending on conditions, riding style and personal preference they may be a great choice. Organic pads can offer the best lever modulation of the three pad types, but may not stop riders sufficiently in demanding circumstances.

3653,3653,5828,"""going to"" vs ""will""","I know several questions were asked about the difference between ""going to"" and ""will"".
Based on several answers (see, for instance, here, here and here), I understood that ""will"" is more spontaneous and ""going to"" is used with more planned actions.

So, it seems that everything is pretty fine. However, in this question, Kosmonaut has an answer in which he states:
""Let's say that tomorrow you will walk your dog from 7 - 8 AM"".

On the one hand, you probably planned to walk your dog long before and thus I should use ""Let's say that tomorrow you're going to walk your dog from 7 - 8 am"". 

On the other hand, since I'm saying ""let's say..."", I'm deciding right now (thus, unplanned) that you will walk your dog. So, even though in this hypothetical situation you made a plan, I'm in a more spontaneous mood deciding right now that that's what you will do tomorrow, and, thus, I should use ""will"".

Which one (if any) of the above explanations is right?

",peglegosaurus,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/users/13183,"Here is a picture of citric acid.



As you noted, there are 3 carboxylic acid groups in citric acid, so there are 3 acidic protons. A chemist looking at this unionized molecule would say that the carboxylic acid group drawn on the right side of the molecule is equivalent to (the same as) the carboxylic acid group drawn on the left.  Therefore, these 2 equivalent carboxylic acid groups should have the same pKa.  The carboxylic acid group drawn in the middle of the diagram is different from the other two (it is not the same as the other two) and should therefore have a different $\ce{pKa}$.  In chemistry, groups are either the same or different.  If they are the same they must be indistinguishable in all aspects, including physical properties like $\ce{pKa}$

That said, we might expect when we treat citric acid with more and more base to see only 2 different $\ce{pKa}$'s, but that is not the case.  In actuality when we treat citric acid with base one of the two different (right and left or middle) carboxylic acid groups will ionize.  Once that happens the ionized citric acid molecule contains a negative charge.  It will be harder to ionize the molecule again and remove the second proton and place a second negative charge on the molecule (bringing like charges together is destabilizing and costs energy).  The same argument tells us that removing the third and final proton will be even more difficult because we wind up with 3 negative charges on the molecule.  As a consequence of this increasing difficulty to remove protons, we observe 3 different $\ce{pKa}$'s.

5716,5716,9056,Can I make a graph of savings in Quicken?,"I've used the ""Reports and Graphs"" section of Quicken in a very basic capacity to see where my money has been going -- ""Income / Expenses"" and ""Spending by Category"" mostly -- and I've been trying to branch out and try the other reports/graphs to get a better idea of my finances.

Here's what I'd like to do:  See a simple graph that shows how much of my money went to Savings each month.

The closest I've found is the ""Net Worth"" chart, where the amount it goes up (or down) is the amount I've saved (or overspent).  I'd like one that shows (Total Income - Total Expenses) over time.  I've also tried the ""Income/Expense"" Graph, but that shows separate bars for income and expense, and I want to show a single bar (or a line graph would be nice too).
",Tim,https://money.stackexchange.com/users/10199,"I found a way to do this, but it's slightly backwards.

Quicken does not allow you to make a graph of just your income, probably because that would be a fairly boring graph for most people.  But it does allow you to do a graph of your expenses.  Doing so, while including income categories, will produce the graph I want, but with negative numbers (savings is negative spending).


Go to Reports -> Reports and Graph Center in the main menu.
In the Quicken Standard Reports section, go to Spending by Category
Click the Customize button.
On the Customize Spending by Category window, on the Categories tab, add all Income and Expense categories (but no Bank categories).

Quicken does not allow you to make a graph of just your income, probably because that would be a fairly boring graph for most people.  But it does allow you to do a graph of your expenses.  Doing so, while including income categories, will produce the graph I want, but with negative numbers (savings is negative spending).


Go to Reports -> Reports and Graph Center in the main menu.
In the Quicken Standard Reports section, go to Spending by Category
Click the Customize button.
On the Customize Spending by Category window, on the Categories tab, add all Income and Expense categories (but no Bank categories).
Click Show Graph.
Set the Column to Month.  This will switch it from a pie chart to a bar graph

I am database developer and want to know best practice in building program.
",Иван Бишевац,https://programmers.stackexchange.com/users/34008,"In theory, there are at least five possible approaches.

Top-Down:

Start with UI mock-shots or a paper prototype. Turn them into real dialogs, and work your way from the button handlers and other controls down through the logic and to the database.

Bottom-Up:

Start with the data structures (probably the database schema). Then add logic (modelling real-world processes); finally, your UI is just an interface to trigger the logic and display the results.

Logic first:

Start with the program logic, implementing data access and a rudimentary UI as needed. Then formalize and harden the data structures, and finally flesh out the UI properly.

Meet in the middle:

Start with database schema and UI, and simultaneously work towards the point where they meet. With this approach, the logic comes last.

Horizontal expansion:

Start by identifying the absolute minimum amount of functionality that would do something interesting, and implement the whole stack (data structures, logic, and UI) for this part. It could be just a basic CRUD cycle with a simple edit dialog for just one entity. Then start adding more features, implementing the whole stack for each feature (hence 'horizontal').

Each of these has pros and cons. 

Top-down gives you something visible early in the process, and allows you to check your functional design with stakeholders - mock-shots often tell users more about a design than flowcharts or walls of text.

Bottom-up gives you a chance to design a rock-solid database schema before you commit to anything; since a database schema is notoriously hard to modify once released, you want to get this part right - the impact of modifying a UI is much smaller and produces fewer and less severe bugs.

Logic-first means you can test the logic before spending serious time on the database and the presentation, which is especially interesting if your logic is going to be really complex.

Meet-in-the-middle combines the advantages of bottom-up and top-down, but you'll have to jump back and forth between two tasks, and you risk ending up with logic that is more complex than necessary because your two ends don't meet naturally.

Horizontal expansion goes well with an iterative workflow, and it has the added advantage that, if you prioritize well, you will have a working application at any given time, so if you don't make a deadline, you will have a version that has fewer features, but is still fully functional, as opposed to a version that has a complete database, but no UI at all.

So which one you choose depends on your personal style, and on the circumstances.

2573,2573,4094,Views Taxonomy Term Argument With Multiple Terms,"Hello i am having a torrid time creating a views block. Let me try to explain without rambling on about nothing as i usually do.

I have a content type (links) which uses the same vocab as my other content type (posts) When viewing a Post i was hoping to display any links that have the same terms.

Ive set it up with an Argument Taxonomy: Term ID. It all works as hoped when i have just ONE term on a post but when i have more than one term things start to get a bit strange.

Actually i should mention that i am using Load default argument from node page and just doing it on term id. I am not using Allow multiple terms per argument box. this returns no results (for nodes with multiple terms)

If i change the Argument type: to term id's seprated by ....+ etc i do get a return but it only shows links for one of the terms. Funny enough the term results are for the term that i dont want to use. I have changed the term weights and everything to try and change it to show the links for the term i was hoping for but i dont seem to be able to influence what terms results appear in the views box i have made.. Its got me tearing my hair out.

Can anyone understand my gibberish and offer any solutions?

Thanks

Now, just print_r($cats) and you will see the array of the categories.

You will need to convert the object to an array, I did so with.

function object_to_array($data) 
{
  if(is_array($data) || is_object($data))
  {
    $result = array(); 
    foreach($data as $key =&gt; $value)
    { 
      $result[$key] = object_to_array($value); 
    }
    return $result;
  }
  return $data;
}


I did

&lt;ul id=""cat-list""&gt;
&lt;?php foreach($cats as $cat) { ?&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""/taxonomy-name/&lt;?php echo $cat['slug']; ?&gt;""&gt;&lt;?php echo $cat['name']; ?&gt; (&lt;?php echo $cat['count']; ?&gt;)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;?php echo $cat['description']; ?&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;?php } ?&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


Hope that helps!

 What I want is this: 

I am using arcpy.EliminatePolygonParts_management() to fill in the holes but have a question about how this tool functions.

When I run the tool using the ""PERCENT"" condition I cannot get the holes to fill in.  Initially I set the percent to 99 thinking that it would delete any part that was smaller than 99 percent of the total area of the polygon.  That didn't work.  Thinking that perhaps I had my logic backwards I set the percent to 1, that didn't work either.

I did get it to work, and produce a polygon that is just the outer boundary but to do so I had to switch to the AREA condition and set the number ridiculously (for my purposes) high, to 1 billion square meters.

I am quite confused by this...  Can anyone offer an explanation to help clarify my understanding of how this tool works and why I can't get the ""PERCENT"" condition, which seems to be the more appropriate choice, to work?

5634,5634,8931,AES 256 Encryption - Is it really easy to decrypt if you have the key?,"So this might sound like a crazy question but bear with me for a minute. I can't find any info on the internet and so am here, although this might have been a good place to start.

I've recently developed an encryption engine using the .net's AES managed classes. I use a 256 bit key generated by the Rfc2898DeriveBytes function. The key is generated from a pass phrase that is at least 40 characters long. The IV is also generated from this pass phrase. The encryption class uses a CypherMode of CBC and a padding mode of PKCS7. There is a static salt that is 8 bytes long. 

The key is stored in a separate database to the data and is itself encrypted using a certificate based on the database master key.

So, my question is: is it really easy to decrypt the data if the attacker has the key? I'm not talking about the Chinese government (or even GHCQ given recent headlines), I'm talking about an attacker who steals both databases. 

What would be the steps they have to follow and/or how can I stop them on their path? The reason I ask this is that I want to know how feasible it is. Is it something that can be done in minutes or does it fall into the bracket of being infeasible? Do they have to calculate all of the parameters used when encrypting?
",bhs,https://crypto.stackexchange.com/users/7684,"I assume you follow Kerckhoff's principle so the attacker knows the padding scheme and derivation function so the answer is yes, it only takes a few seconds to decrypt and anyone can do it. 

If he doesn't know these things, he can find them by trial and error (assuming he can get his hands on a valid ciphertext).

The IV can be sent in the clear so making it depend on the key reveals some information on the key. It should also be unique for each session so I'm a bit worried about it. It should be OK if the KDF you're using is non-deterministic, which implies it uses its own IV so the problem remains. See this question for more on IVs.



Edit based on comments:
The cracking procedure is the following: 
$a$ is the number of all modern ciphers. Let's set this to 100. $m$ is the number of modes per cipher, set it to 6. $k=100$ is the number of key derivation functions, $p=100$ are the padding schemes. The values are arbitrary. So we have $(p*k*m*a*c)/n = 6*10^6$ which equals to approx. 69 days with $c=1$ second and $n=1$ processor. 

Your adversary will solve the problem in $69/2=34.5$ days. Not as practical but definitely feasible, especially if you throw extra processors at it. This solution is completly brute-force, it makes no attempt at distinguishing and pre-eliminating ciphers.

Since non-indistinguishability is a business requirement (really?) you could just get away with using ECB instead of any other mode.

1956,1956,3117,Can the Mage Wars Warlock be played without any Demon cards?,"As the subject states, I was wondering if the Mage Wars Core Set comes with enough Fire type cards to allow the Warlock Mage to build a spellbook with absolutely no Demon cards. Without seeing the cards, I will assume that most, if not all of the other Dark magic cards are OK, but I would ultimately prefer a pure Fire Magic spellbook.

So as to preemptively answer the almost inevitable 'Why?', I will simply say that, as an orthodox Christian, my conscience doesn't allow me to play a game with such cards. I would prefer not to debate/explain this further, as I believe such a discussion is well beyond the scope of this site.

When you boot virtual box you will have different hardware than when you boot from the bare metal. This will confuse windows, which tend to store its hardware configuration so it can boot faster.

1600,1600,2516,Dealing with digital circuits and their associated switching speed?,"When designing a digital one-minute counting circuit I came across a difficult problem. 

Basically, I designed the circuit to drive the (normally HIGH) clock of the 10s slot low if the 1s slot's current state was 9 (actually, just if the first and last bits are HIGH -> 1001)

The devices I am using are positive edge, so when the 1s slot returns to zero the condition is no longer satisfied - therefore the clock returns to a HIGH state and increments the 10s slot.

The problem is that I was getting double clock problems(7->8 transition and the designed clock mechanism).   

It turns out that there was just enough delay in the switching between 7 -> 8 (0111 -> 1000) that the first/last bit HIGH condition is satisfied:

i.e., some combination occurs in the transition period to register a logical HIGH at the output

1001 1011 1101 1111

The temporary solution to the problem I came up with was to actually keep the clock for the 10s slot LOW until the condition where the 1s slot equals 0 (0000) is satisfied(So, essentially clock WHEN we get to the state as opposed to before). However, this solution requires too many gates (a 4-input NOR minimum). My previous design was actually fed from another part in the design that is already present, so it didn't require any additional circuitry. 

Any ideas on a more efficient solution?  




The IC's used in this design are the 74LS47 (7Segment decoder) and the 74LS163 (4-bit binary counter). The pull-down resistor inclusion is a mechanism to set the counters to 00 and hold while the switch is closed.

1969,1969,3137,Is there a name for the number of values a variable can take?,"For example, a bit or a boolean can be either 0 or 1 so the number 2 is associated with it. Similarly, for a byte which is 8 bits, the maximum number of different assignments would be 2^8.

Is there a name for this number?

When we pass everything through our system that has ECMAScript, Java and MySQL, then a boolean does not have only two possible assignments. For instance, a false boolean gets saved as a 0 and the boxed value could be null so a boolean suddenly can get true, false, 0, 1, null or even undefined or &lt;missing&gt;.

I think it could get problematic in tests to guarantee that the values are not inconsistent. For instance, a value boolean locked could become null and then when a script or a layout template evaluates it then it will evaluate to false somewhere if the real value was null and similar problems.

So why don't we always assert that a boolean has the same number of possible values (2 values) and similarly for other types?

There is a mathematical term named ""arity"" that is something similar but not exactly, and statistics and probability theory also has the concept of ""event space"" that would be almost exactly what I mean. For instance, the event space for a boolean would be the set {0,1} which has cardinality 2 and that cardinality doesn't get preserved throughout the system, especially when data is passed as polyglots and/or serialized (json, jsonp, xml, yaml).
",Niklas Rosencrantz,https://programmers.stackexchange.com/users/12893,"If you subscribe to the ""types as a set of values"" interpretation of type theory, then cardinality is in fact a good name.

5921,5921,9378,No value for $TERM and no -T specified,"I recently upgraded (with apt-get dist-upgrade) my Kubuntu and Lubuntu Linux boxes, and now every time I log into one of these machines, I get this message:

tput: No value for $TERM and no -T specified


Here is a screenshot of the exact message:


This happened on both my Lubuntu machine and Kubuntu machine, and it wasn't a problem until after I upgraded; so I suspect that it was not user error.

How can I fix this?

UPDATE

I have tracked this down to my .bashrc file, which is getting called by my .profile file.  Though, the fact that my .bashrc file now runs when I do a GUI login whereas it didn't before I upgraded is a bit weird.  And no, I haven't modified my .bashrc file or my .profile recently.  Also, bash isn't my default shell.

The problem is that I am calling tput in my .bashrc file to set up variables for use in adding color to the prompt.  But at the (inappropriate) time when my .bashrc file now gets run, $TERM is not set.

fgRed=$(tput setaf 1)     ; fgGreen=$(tput setaf 2)  ; fgBlue=$(tput setaf 4)

Updated question: How should I fix this?  Should I set $TERM myself?  Or should I just not set these variables if $TERM is not set?

UPDATE 2

One solution I tried was to check whether $TERM was set. But this didn't seem to work; I still got the same error message.  Here's the code:

if [ ! ""$TERM"" = """" ]; then
  #Do stuff here
fi


So apparently $TERM was set, but tput still concluded it wasn't.
",Sildoreth,https://askubuntu.com/users/286571,"The error dialog is due to the fix of bug #678421, so it's my fault. ;) It tells you about errors due to some command(s) in one of your configuration files. If you scroll to the top, you can see which file is causing the error messages.

Possibly Serg's answer is sufficient to get rid of the warning dialog.

Edit:

Would like to add a couple of things due to the updated question.

At the check-up the service representative said my key-chain was too heavy and if I planned to keep the car for long I should reduce weight on the key-chain to keep from damaging the ignition.  I only have six other keys, a hook and two small plastic electronic computer devices on the single key ring.  It doesn't seem excessive at all compared to the usual key rings you see.

6032,6032,9574,How to remember a trusted machine using two factor authentication (like Google's system),"We are developing a web application that will use two factor authentication. We are likely to try and emulate something similar to that used by google, where to login you enter a username and password, and then receive a token in an SMS message to be entered as well.

We would like to allow users to remember a client machine if they would like to so that they can login for 30 days without requiring the second authentication method. What information will we have access to (through headers of the web page requests etc.) which we can use to uniquely identify this trusted client machine? 

Obviously a user can have more than one trusted client machine, and I completely expect that if they use two different browsers on the same trusted machine machine, each browser will have to be trusted independently.

Setting a cookie on the machine with some GUID which means this is trusted simply would not be good enough, as someone else could just copy the cookie, and create it on their own browser circumventing the two factor authentication.

3764,3764,5991,What's the best way to scan in hundreds of pictures?,"I have thousands of old pictures which were sitting in a photo album. Unfortunately, instead of the photo album protecting the pictures, the plastic coverings yellowed, and the pictures themselves had to be carefully extracted from the books. There is also quite a bit of powdered paper (the backings on the books pretty much fell apart while we extracted the pictures), and the fronts of the images are still a bit sticky.

These pictures are 30+ years old, are often extremely faded, and were originally taken on (what I think is) ""110 film"" -- they are approximately 2.5"" squares.

Anyway, I need to scan all these images in to preserve them from further decay. Unfortunately, it's taking forever -- going through less than 100 images took an entire day, even if one discounts any time spent in Photoshop trying to remove some of the photo album's artifacts on the images.

What I really need is some method of scanning the images in faster. Most automated solutions aren't going to work because they accept 4x6s as their smallest image size, and even if that was not the case, the adhesives still stuck to the prints would probably ruin any such device in 5 seconds flat.

1762,1762,2796,Is a VPN really secure at the VPN providers side?,"Please forgive my basic ignorance regarding a VPN connection.

As I understand it, a VPN connection encrypts all the data between my computer and the VPN provider. Thus preventing my ISP from seeing my data.

But on the VPN providers side of the connection, surely the VPN provider uses an ISP of some sort. So they send out requests I have made over their ISP, just as if I were sitting there using the ISP they pay for. And they send the data back to me, encrypted.

So on the ISP side they use, the data they send is unencrypted, so it can be understood by other sites/services.

If this is the case, am I not just pushing my data further along. Its still unencrypted but at a different end (VPNs Webside). Its only the data back to me, which is encrypted.

Correct. A VPN is designed to give you a secure connection to the VPN provider; it essentially simulates your being physically on their network. For instance, a corporate VPN simulates being in the office physically connected to the corporate network. This is great when there's some reason to trust the VPN network more than the network you're on for the things you're doing; however, all it amounts to is substituting the VPN provider's network for the network you're on.

4846,4846,7713,Advice on using FORMAT_MODULE_PATH,"From what I have read FORMAT_MODULE_PATH allows to use custom formats.

How can I access the first value from DATETIME_INPUT_FORMATS in my application?

The DATETIME_INPUT_FORMATS variable for german should be '%d.%m.%Y', whereas for english should be '%Y-%m-%d'. I want to use the values from the formats.py files depending on the language.    

I followed the Django documentation for how to use the FORMAT_MODULE_PATH variable, but I don't get the expected results.

settings.py:
    USE_L10N = True
    USE_I18N = True
    FORMAT_MODULE_PATH = 'myproject.formats'

            formats.py
        de/
            __init__.py
            formats.py


I change the browser's language from English to German, and back and nothing happens with the date format. It is always '%Y-%m-%d'. The displayed date format is the value of settings.DATE_INPUT_FORMATS[0].

Django version is 1.2.5 and Python version is 2.5.4.

1016,1016,1604,Monitor when the user enables/disables mobile data,"I'm building an app, on which I want to capture when a user enables or disables mobile data usage on his device.

I read about using android.net.conn.CONNECTIVITY_CHANGE to monitor such changes, but then I came across various posts and questions here that said that this wouldn't work, and the majority of the answers suggested to use reflection. 

These led me to believe that there is no specific event being fired when the user changes the state of mobile data that I can use.

Is it possible that a custom event can be created to handle it? If not, what would you suggest the best practice is for monitoring the state of mobile data?

I have tested this code and it is working perfectly. The loop to generate the word is spending 625.25us sent per byte, thus achieving almost ideal to have the 9600 bps. What I need is to synchronize this code with a serial RS 232 traditional or create a serial bit bang receiving. I performed some tests using traditional functions of RS 232 and folow the code below, the received is different from what is being sent. Can anyone help me please? The serial data receiver is picking up different than what I'm sending.

char uart_getchar (void)

    while (!(UCSRA &amp; (1 &lt;&lt; RXC)));

}

while (1)
{

5803,5803,9192,numpy float: 10x slower than builtin in arithmetic operations?,"EDIT:

I rerun the code under the Windows 7 x64 (Intel Core i7 930 @ 3.8GHz).

Again, the code is:

from datetime import datetime
import numpy as np

START_TIME = datetime.now()

# one of the following lines is uncommented before execution
#s = np.float64(1)
#s = np.float32(1)
#s = 1.0

for i in range(10000000):
    s = (s + 8) * s % 2399232

print(s)
print('Runtime:', datetime.now() - START_TIME)


The timings are:


float64: 16.1s
float32: 16.1s
float: 3.2s


Now both np floats (either 64 or 32) are 5 times slower than the built-in float. Still, a significant difference. I'm trying to figure out where it comes from.

EDIT:

Thank you for the answers, they help me understand how to deal with this problem.

But I still would like to know the precise reason (based on the source code perhaps) why the code below runs 10 times slow with float64 than with float.

EDIT:

numpy.float64 is 10 times slower than float in arithmetic calculations. It's so bad that even converting to float and back before the calculations makes the program run 3 times faster. Why? Is there anything I can do to fix it?

I want to emphasize that my timings are not due to any of the following:


the function calls
the conversion between numpy and python float
the creation of objects


I updated my code to make it clearer where the problem lies. With the new code, it would seem I see a ten-fold performance hit from using numpy data types:

from datetime import datetime
import numpy as np

START_TIME = datetime.now()

# one of the following lines is uncommented before execution
#s = np.float64(1)
#s = np.float32(1)
#s = 1.0

for i in range(10000000):
    s = (s + 8) * s % 2399232

print(s)
print('Runtime:', datetime.now() - START_TIME)


The timings are:


float64: 34.56s
float32: 35.11s
float: 3.53s


Just for the hell of it, I also tried:

from datetime import datetime
import numpy as np

START_TIME = datetime.now()

s = np.float64(1)
for i in range(10000000):
    s = float(s)
    s = (s + 8) * s % 2399232
    s = np.float64(s)

print(s)
print('Runtime:', datetime.now() - START_TIME)


The execution time is 13.28 s; it's actually 3 times faster to convert the float64 to float and back than to use it as is. Still, the conversion takes its toll, so overall it's more than 3 times slower compared to the pure-python float.

My machine is:


Intel Core 2 Duo T9300 (2.5GHz)
WinXP Professional (32-bit)
ActiveState Python 3.1.3.5
Numpy 1.5.1


END OF EDIT

ORIGINAL QUESTION:

I am getting really weird timings for the following code:

import numpy as np
s = 0
for i in range(10000000):
    s += np.float64(1) # replace with np.float32 and built-in float



built-in float: 4.9 s
float64: 10.5 s
float32: 45.0 s


Why is float64 twice slower than float? And why is float32 5 times slower than float64?

Is there any way to avoid the penalty of using np.float64, and have numpy functions return built-in float instead of float64?

I found that using numpy.float64 is much slower than Python's float, and numpy.float32 is even slower (even though I'm on a 32-bit machine).

numpy.float32 on my 32-bit machine. Therefore, every time I use various numpy functions such as numpy.random.uniform, I convert the result to float32 (so that further operations would be performed at 32-bit precision).

Is there any way to set a single variable somewhere in the program or in the command line, and make all numpy functions return float32 instead of float64?
",max,https://stackoverflow.com/users/336527,"The answer is quite simple:  the memory allocation might be part of it, but the biggest problem is that arithmetic operations for numpy scalars is done using ""ufuncs"" which are meant to be fast for several hundred values not just 1.  There is some overhead in choosing the correct function to call and setting up the loops.  Overhead which is un-necessary for scalars.  

It was easier to just have the scalars be converted to 0-d arrays and then passed to the corresponding numpy ufunc then write separate calculation methods for each of the many different scalar types that NumPy supports.

2666,2666,4246,Server compromised - How do I find out what is sending mail,"A friend of mine has a few small businesses and hosts Wordpress-based sites for them on a dedicated host. The Wordpress installs were neglected for awhile and the host ended up getting compromised. There's now 100's of spam messages going out every second. What can I look at to determine what's generating the mail?

The only way I can get the spam to stop is to shutdown Postfix. We've had it off for a few days to prevent spamming, but this also means he can't send mail from his businesses addresses.

If I shutdown both apache and postfix, netstat shows no remote connections except my SSH login. If I then start postfix (but leave apache stopped), 100's of remote connections to port 25 immediately open. This leads me to believe that some process on the host is doing this, rather than something coming in through Wordpress/some rogue script that we missed in the clean-up. There were also IRC bots on here, but we've removed those, and netstat no longer shows any open connections to IRC.

When I look at ps axjf - all of the smtp processes roll up to /usr/libexec/postfix/master, which has a parent id of 1. This doesn't really give me an idea of where the mail is being generated.

Neither ps nor top show any suspicious processes (as far as I can tell).

What else can I look at to see what's creating/sending the mail? I can post the output of ps whatever_flags_you_want both with and without postfix running, if it will help.

Thanks.

I was told by a search committee that ended up making an offer that they thought I might be unlikely to accept an offer and that one of these update emails rovided a useful signal. Of course, if they're not interested, emailing will probably just be noise and extra work for them.

I think that emailing or not-emailing is unlikely to tip the scale either way. They're going to make a decision based on the intersection of the quality of your work and what they're interested in having in their department. But out of kindness for the work of the search committee and its chair, try to do it as little as possible.

5047,5047,8031,Keypad to set a counter,"Is there a way to use a standard Matrix Keypad to set a synchronous counter IC without having to use a micro controller?
",user120404,https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/41188,"Here's a generic logic diagram for scanning a matrix keypad; I'll leave it up to you to translate it to your favorite implementation technology, which could be anything from SSI/MSI logic to a CPLD to part of an FPGA.







simulate this circuit &ndash; Schematic created using CircuitLab

This circuit scans the keys, one at a time, at a 1 kHz rate. When a key is pressed, the output of the multiplexer goes true and triggers U5. U5 is retriggerable, which means that its output remains true for as long as its input is true, plus another 10 ms or so after it goes false. This serves to debounce the keypresses. The QN output stops the scanning as long as a key is held down, and the Q output (data strobe) indicates to the external logic that the key location is available on the data out lines.

Ideally, you arrange the keys so that their locations are also the values you want them to represent; otherwise, use a lookup table to translate.

Note that U5 could be an analog multivibrator if you're using SSI/MSI logic; or it could be a digital counter driven by the 1 kHz clock if you're using a CPLD or FPGA.

But because of the small town nature some business owners do not know all the laws.  And since I am starting this from a career in architecture I am not quite clear on copyrights.  So here is my problem.  

I created a sign that has an oval with scrolls and flowers in different colors on a field of turquoise.  The client did not want to spend the money on a logo design so I said that I will  just retain the rights so that she would have to come to me for the approval to use the logo on anything else.  So anyway everything seems to be fine, I do her business cards and now all of a sudden I see a sign at the street.  I quoted her on this job figuring in using the logo.  Apparently this company did for much less and you can tell by the quality.

But here is my problem.  She had a jpeg that I allowed her to have so she could create her own fliers and I was ok with that since it would not have made me much if any money.  Well I am looking at the sign that the other person did and all that was done is they made a longer oval since this sign is more rectangle and used a different font.  And put this over the design that I did.  To me this is copyright infringement since the client did not want to buy all the rights.  But who do I address?  The client or the person that did the sign?

Although that's not saying much. Here are a few other options as well:

Jinni: http://www.jinni.com/ was recommended by phwd as well.

Get Glue (as recommended by tsodermann below) does something similar to what you are looking for as well: http://getglue.com

Hulu: http://Hulu.com also offers recommendations after videos are complete.

youTube: As mention by phwd, http://www.youtube.com/disco is a good option if you are looking for more home grown options. 

Netflix offers a suggestion feature based on things that you watch on their service. It takes into account movies and tv shows that you have watched online, as well as rented via their mail service. 

You could sign up for a free account and take the preliminary survey if you really wanted to get a list of suggested videos/shows based on your likes/dislikes. 

IMDB also has a chart of the top movies of all time, sortable by a number of different criteria, including, genre, decade, votes by their users, etc. View the list here: http://www.imdb.com/chart/top

3395,3395,5413,Dealing with digital circuits and their associated switching speed?,"When designing a digital one-minute counting circuit I came across a difficult problem. 

Basically, I designed the circuit to drive the (normally HIGH) clock of the 10s slot low if the 1s slot's current state was 9 (actually, just if the first and last bits are HIGH -> 1001)

The devices I am using are positive edge, so when the 1s slot returns to zero the condition is no longer satisfied - therefore the clock returns to a HIGH state and increments the 10s slot.

The problem is that I was getting double clock problems(7->8 transition and the designed clock mechanism).   

It turns out that there was just enough delay in the switching between 7 -> 8 (0111 -> 1000) that the first/last bit HIGH condition is satisfied:

i.e., some combination occurs in the transition period to register a logical HIGH at the output

1001 1011 1101 1111

The temporary solution to the problem I came up with was to actually keep the clock for the 10s slot LOW until the condition where the 1s slot equals 0 (0000) is satisfied(So, essentially clock WHEN we get to the state as opposed to before). However, this solution requires too many gates (a 4-input NOR minimum). My previous design was actually fed from another part in the design that is already present, so it didn't require any additional circuitry. 

Any ideas on a more efficient solution?  




The IC's used in this design are the 74LS47 (7Segment decoder) and the 74LS163 (4-bit binary counter). The pull-down resistor inclusion is a mechanism to set the counters to 00 and hold while the switch is closed. 
",sherrellbc,https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/26864,"The way I see it, you're causing problems for yourself by using multiple clock domains, and worse, deriving a clock from data. The problem with data is that it has to settle. That's why we have separate clocks. A combinatorial circuit which evaluates some variables and then drives a clock invites trouble.

Secondly, if you're going to kludge it, at least do it right. You cannot detect a 9 by noting that the first and last of four bits bit are 1. If you want a signal which fires when there is a 9, you must evaluate all four bits earnestly and trigger that signal only when they are 1001.

There is no reason not to design this in such a way that a single clock is distributed to all the chips. Then it's a matter of running the clock slowly enough that all inputs and outputs settle before each edge arrives.

Read the data sheet. The TI one clearly says ""The carry look-ahead circuitry provides for n-bit synchronous applications without additional gating. Instrumental in accomplishing this function are two count-enable inputs and a ripple carry output. Both count enable inputs P and T must be high to count [...]"".

It sounds like these chips are intended to be hooked up together easily. You can prevent the upper digit from counting up on the next clock edge by de-asserting its count enable inputs. Whenever the lower digit is nine, your circuitry can enable the upper digit chip to count, and also set up the lower digit to perform a synchronous reset. 

When the next clock edge arrives (to all chips), the upper digit counts up, and the other flips to zero.

The product is an application and is heavy on user interaction.  Think web 2.0 or mobile application, not a marketing or commerce site, or some back-end tool with only command-line access.
I realize that it is not always clear who is a UX person and who is a developer (nor should it be), so I'd like to focus on overall team resource allocation.  For instance, ""My team puts 25% of our resource-time into UX design/research vs. 75% of our resource-time in development.""  
I am not distinguishing between front-end and back-end development as it is too platform-specific and difficult to tease out the dividing like.  It's all software development for this question.
EDIT: Development is occurring in an agile-esque, ongoing manner, rather than a one-time, big-bang delivery.


So:


How does this proportion commonly look in practice?
How should it look?  Or, better yet, what has been the proportion on successful teams?


(I realize this is a classic ""it depends"" question, but I suspect that there is some use in asking when constrained by a few parameters, and allowing that conditions will vary.  I am also open to suggestions to further constrain the question.)

1914,1914,3046,Why do objects fall at the same acceleration?,"I read these two posts and now I am more confused.

Do heavier objects fall faster?

Don&#39;t heavier objects actually fall faster because they exert their own gravity?

I was going to ask: if mass is an objects tendency to resist acceleration then why do two objects of different masses fall to the Earth at the same acceleration?

Then I read those posts and it seems that even though it is very small, the more massive object falls faster. Okay I understand, both objects attract each other.

If two cars of different masses collide doesn't the car with less mass accelerate more even though both cars received the same Force. Then that implies you need more force to accelerate a large mass than to accelerate a small mass. Because that is how I see it, the Moon attracts the Earth with the same Force as the Earth attracts the Moon but the Earth accelerates less due to its larger mass.

So then how is mass an object's tendency to resist acceleration? I am aware of $F_1 = F_2 = GMm/r^2$. So should we not really be able to see the difference in acceleration when dropping a massive object?
",CharlieK,https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/43959,"Although Pranav Hosangadi has explained, I will try to explain where you might be going wrong. I think this will be helpful for you. And I think it will not be waste of time in typing the answer for you.  


  I was going to ask: if mass is an objects tendency to resist acceleration then why do two objects of different masses fall to the Earth at the same acceleration?


Yes, you are right. If we want to push a feather we need less force and the feather resists the acceleration to less extent, and then if you want to push a iron ball we need more force and the iron ball resists the acceleration to more extent.   

So, it is correct that mass is the tendency of object to resist acceleration.   

Then, why do feather and iron ball gets accelerated to same extent towards the earth?
Isn't iron ball's mass greater than feather's mass, so iron ball should have greater tendency to resist acceleration than feather, thus iron ball should fall first than feather?    

Here, if we would had applied same force on iron ball and feather, iron ball would had greater tendency to resist acceleration than feather, so iron ball would get accelerated to less extent than feather. Here, although iron ball gets accelerated to less extent, its greater mass than feather makes force to be equal to force exerted on feather, where acceleration of feather is more but mass is less.  

But, earth doesn't exert same force on feather and iron ball. Force exerted on iron ball is greater than force exerted on feather. As it is confirmed from Pranav Hosangdi's answer that acceleration due to gravity is independent of mass of the body to which earth exerts force.  


  Then I read those posts and it seems that even though it is very small, the more massive object falls faster. Okay I understand, both objects attract each other.  


Seeing your comment, I  hope you have understood that because of air resistance iron ball falls first than feather.  


  If two cars of different masses collide doesn't the car with less mass accelerate more even though both cars received the same Force.   


Yes, the car with less mass accelerates to greater extent than the car with greater mass as  you stated force to be same on both.  


  Then that implies you need more force to accelerate a large mass than to accelerate a small mass. Because that is how I see it, the Moon attracts the Earth with the same Force as the Earth attracts the Moon but the Earth accelerates less due to its larger mass.


Yes, you need more force to accelerate a large mass than to accelerate a small mass. That is the reason earth exerts more force on massive objects than on tiny objects. You are also correct in saying about earth moon interaction.  


  So then how is mass an object's tendency to resist acceleration?  


So far there is nothing which has contradicted with how mass can't be tendency to resist acceleration. If there is any thing you can comment.  


  . So should we not really be able to see the difference in acceleration when dropping a massive object?  


Massive object and tiny objects are not exerted with the same force by the earth, you are thinking that on both the object force is same. Earth exerts different force on massive objects and tiny objects. Acceleration due to gravity has constant value at different points in space, just like electric field has constant value at different points in space. Acceleration due to gravity can be considered as gravitational field. So, no matter what mass you keep, it will be accelerated to same extent.

I think this will be helpful for you. And I think it will not be waste of time in typing the answer for you.  


  I was going to ask: if mass is an objects tendency to resist acceleration then why do two objects of different masses fall to the Earth at the same acceleration?


Yes, you are right. If we want to push a feather we need less force and the feather resists the acceleration to less extent, and then if you want to push a iron ball we need more force and the iron ball resists the acceleration to more extent.   

So, it is correct that mass is the tendency of object to resist acceleration.   

Then, why do feather and iron ball gets accelerated to same extent towards the earth?
Isn't iron ball's mass greater than feather's mass, so iron ball should have greater tendency to resist acceleration than feather, thus iron ball should fall first than feather?    

Here, if we would had applied same force on iron ball and feather, iron ball would had greater tendency to resist acceleration than feather, so iron ball would get accelerated to less extent than feather. Here, although iron ball gets accelerated to less extent, its greater mass than feather makes force to be equal to force exerted on feather, where acceleration of feather is more but mass is less.  

But, earth doesn't exert same force on feather and iron ball. Force exerted on iron ball is greater than force exerted on feather. As it is confirmed from Pranav Hosangdi's answer that acceleration due to gravity is independent of mass of the body to which earth exerts force.

The initial problem is the recurrence relation with $a_1\approx 1.27$ the unknown constant and

196,196,313,Slow queries related to subqueries using aggregation,"Here's a simplified version of the queries I am running:

select
    ...
from
    editions
    join edition_events on edition_events.edition_id = editions.id
    join events on events.id = edition_events.event_id
    join (
        select
            event_id,
            array_agg(date_start),
            array_agg(date_end)
        from
            event_dates
        group by
            event_id
        ) as dates on dates.event_id = events.id
WHERE
    editions.id = ?;


These queries ran great with my test data (~1500 events).  Now that I'm starting to use a copy of the real data (~400,000 events, ~500,000 event_dates), my application is timing out before I get results back from the database.  I have added indexes on all relevant columns, which only helped a little bit.  I've narrowed down the problem to the subqueries that use aggregation.

Now the real version of these subqueries does things like time zone manipulation or a count instead of array_agg, so using a trigger to update a counter column is not practical in many instances.  The dates associated with events must be individual rows rather than stored as an array since they have a foreign key relationship with other tables.

What would be my best bet for improving performance here?  I understand that the subquery is being evaluated first, but I don't know which dates I actually need to look at until I've done the joins.  I have looked at lateral joins, but I am uncertain if they would help here (and most information I can find is along the lines of ""look, new feature!"").  Since I am still using 9.2, I don't want to ask to upgrade to 9.3+ if it won't actually solve my problem.
",cimmanon,https://dba.stackexchange.com/users/31374,"Your approach (""aggregate first, join later"") generally performs best when you need to retrieve the whole table or large parts of it - or as long as the aggregated table is small.

For only a few rows in the result, this gets disproportionately expensive for big tables, since the whole table (event_dates in your case) has to be processed. In these cases, it's better to revert the paradigm to ""join first, aggregate later"". The equivalent query would then be:

SELECT e.id
      ,array_agg(ed.date_start) AS starts
      ,array_agg(ed.date_end)   AS ends
      ,...
FROM   editions       e
JOIN   edition_events ee ON ee.edition_id = e.id
JOIN   events         ev ON ev.id = ee.event_id
JOIN   event_dates    ed ON ed.event_id = e.id
WHERE  e.id = ?
GROUP  BY e.id;


This should help with any version of Postgres.
Also using table aliases to simplify the syntax.

I don't see how LATERAL (Postgres 9.3+) could help this query. You would use it to reference a column from the left side of the join tree that you couldn't access on the same query level otherwise, often to produce multiple rows to join to. Neither is the case here. What you are thinking of can be implemented with plain old correlated subqueries, but those typically perform worse.
Don't take my word for it. Run a quick test with EXPLAIN ANALYZE for your case (with your real life data), then you know for sure.

4033,4033,6441,Is it possible to get a popup to ignore MenuDropAlignment in a WPF / Touch app?,"As a bit of background - Windows has a facility for Touch/TabletPCs whereby it shifts the position of popups/menus depending on your ""handedness"" (to prevent the menu appearing under your hand). 

Essentially what this does is if you are set to ""right handed"" (which it seems to default to once you've connected a touch device), every popup you open is artificially kicked to the left - this causes massive layout issues where we try and line up a popup with the item it ""popped up from"" :

Tablet PC Settings set to Left handed - no artificial correction from Windows


Tablet PC Settings set to Right handed - Windows artificially adjusts our positioning


We can detect what this setting is set to with SystemParameters.MenuDropAlignment, and for trivial popups we can adjust this using the actual width of the popup - but for dynamic popups and when we throw right to left support into the mix, this just doesn't work.

Currently it's looking more likely that we are going to have to go through every popup, manually work out a value to adjust the kick, and add something like this to every one:

&lt;MultiDataTrigger&gt;
    &lt;MultiDataTrigger.Conditions&gt;
        &lt;Condition Binding=""{Binding Source={x:Static SystemParameters.MenuDropAlignment}}"" Value=""True""/&gt;
        &lt;Condition Binding=""{Binding RelativeSource={RelativeSource Mode=Self}, Path=FlowDirection}"" Value=""RightToLeft""/&gt;
    &lt;/MultiDataTrigger.Conditions&gt;
    &lt;MultiDataTrigger.Setters&gt;
        &lt;Setter Property=""HorizontalOffset"" Value=""-50""/&gt; &lt;!-- Set to arbitrary value to test --&gt;
    &lt;/MultiDataTrigger.Setters&gt;
&lt;/MultiDataTrigger&gt;


So.. back to the question :-) Does anyone know of a way to stop a WPF popup looking at this setting at all? 

For those that don't have a touch device you can access the Tablet PC settings by running:

C:\Windows\explorer.exe shell:::{80F3F1D5-FECA-45F3-BC32-752C152E456E}

5553,5553,8820,Can a wizard choose where to place their soul piece when creating a horcrux?,"In the world of Harry Potter a wizard can remove a part of their soul and place it into another object through the act of homicide, thus creating a horcrux. Is the wizard able to direct their soul pieces such that they can choose what becomes a horcrux? Tied into that question, it seems possible that a wizard can kill someone and not create a horcrux (Peter Pettigrew killed Cedric Digory but no one seemed concerned that Peter made a horcrux), so how/why did Harry Potter wind up with a sliver of Voldemort's soul when it seems inconceivable that Voldemort's intention was to put one there?

So, technically, when Voldemort cast the Killing Curse, it rebounded against him, severing yet another part of his soul.

3474,3474,5539,KL divergence between two univariate Gaussians,"I need to determine the KL-divergence between two Gaussians. I am comparing my results to these, but I can't reproduce their result. My result is obviously wrong, because the KL is not 0 for KL(p, p).

I wonder where I am doing a mistake and ask if anyone can spot it.

Let $p(x) = N(\mu_1, \sigma_1)$ and $q(x) = N(\mu_2, \sigma_2)$. From Bishop's
PRML I know that

$$KL(p, q) = - \int p(x) \log q(x) dx + \int p(x) \log p(x) dx$$

where integration is done over all real line, and that

$$\int p(x) \log p(x) dx = \frac{1}{2} (1 + \log 2 \pi \sigma_1^2),$$

so I restrict myself to $\int p(x) \log q(x) dx$, which I can write out as

$$-\int p(x) \log \frac{1}{(2 \pi \sigma_2^2)^{(1/2)}} e^{-\frac{(x-\mu_2)^2}{2 \sigma_2^2}} dx,$$

which I can separate into

$$\frac{1}{2} \log (2 \pi \sigma_2^2) - \int p(x) \log e^{-\frac{(x-\mu_2)^2}{2 \sigma_2^2}} dx.$$

Taking the log I get

$$\frac{1}{2} \log (2 \pi \sigma_2^2) - \int p(x) -\frac{(x-\mu_2)^2}{2 \sigma_2^2} dx,$$

where I separate the sums and get $\sigma_2^2$ out of the integral.

$$\frac{1}{2} \log (2 \pi \sigma_2^2) + \frac{\int p(x) x^2 dx - \int p(x) 2x\mu dx + \int p(x) \mu^2 dx}{2 \sigma_2^2}$$

Letting $\langle \rangle$ denote the expectation operator under $p$, I can rewrite this as

$$\frac{1}{2} \log (2 \pi \sigma_2^2) + \frac{\langle x^2 \rangle - 2 \langle x \rangle \mu_2 + \mu_2^2}{2 \sigma_2^2}.$$

We know that $var(x) = \langle x^2 \rangle - \langle x \rangle ^2$. Thus 

$$\langle x^2 \rangle = \sigma_1^2 + \mu_1^2$$

and therefore

$$\frac{1}{2} \log (2 \pi \sigma^2) + \frac{\sigma_1^2 + \mu_1^2 - 2 \mu_1 \mu_2 + \mu_2^2}{2 \sigma_2^2},$$

which I can put as

$$\frac{1}{2} \log (2 \pi \sigma_2^2) + \frac{\sigma_1^2 + (\mu_1 - \mu_2)^2}{2 \sigma_2^2}.$$

Putting everything together, I get to 

\begin{align*}
KL(p, q) &amp;= - \int p(x) \log q(x) dx + \int p(x) \log p(x) dx\\
&amp;= \frac{1}{2} \log (2 \pi \sigma_2^2) + \frac{\sigma_1^2 + (\mu_1 - \mu_2)^2}{2 \sigma_2^2} - \frac{1}{2} (1 + \log 2 \pi \sigma_1^2)\\
&amp;= \log \frac{\sigma_2}{\sigma_1} + \frac{\sigma_1^2 + (\mu_1 - \mu_2)^2}{2 \sigma_2^2}.
\end{align*}
Which is wrong since it equals $1$ for two identical Gaussians.

Can anyone spot my error?

Update

Thanks to mpiktas for clearing things up. The correct answer is:

$KL(p, q) = \log \frac{\sigma_2}{\sigma_1} + \frac{\sigma_1^2 + (\mu_1 - \mu_2)^2}{2 \sigma_2^2} - \frac{1}{2}$

Were these editions also available in the 4.0 version of DNN?
If so, is there a way to tell which edition the site is running?  I didn't see any immediately obvious designation in the admin areas.


Thanks!

4488,4488,7117,How do I deal with a slow and undedicated colleague in the team?,"I have been working on a new project. The project works like this: The end user can access a webapp using a link and he can add multiple systems on his network and manage that particular systems details. My part involves the front end and the webserver, which is done in python. My python actually communicates with another project which is entirely done in c &amp; c++. The c/c++ project is the main app which does all the functionality. My python sends the user request to it and displays the response from it to the user. 

I am very familiar with my work and I will finish it soon. Since that's not much work in it. And I am a person who loves to work. I spends most of the time in office and only go home when I feel sleepy.

The c/c++ app is managed by another colleague who has 5+ year experience and can do things much faster than me, but he never does it. May be he doesn't like to do it. His app crashes often when my python communicate with it or returns wrong values. It's full of bugs. Since my app depends on it, I am having a hard time building it. Instead of fixing the bugs, he asks me to slow down my work. He asks me to tell manager that my work needs a lot of time. He is asking me to fool the manager and even forcing me to work slowly like him.

During project meeting, when manager asks him about the bugs he says that he fixed everything and it works fine. Since he is my colleague, I couldn't tell anything to the manager. I obviously need to have a good relationship with my colleagues more than my manager, since most of the time we will be with our colleagues, not with the manager.

I am not able to tell the manager anything regarding this, since if manager asks him why, then he may think I complained about him to the manager. And he keeps on lying in the meeting. And since he fixes the bug slowly, it even slows down my work. Now I thought of working on the front-end part of my app  and finishing it off so that in the mean time he can make his project stable. Now he is asking me to tell the manager that my front end part require a lot of work and I may need more and more time, simply so that he can drag the project down. And the sad thing is our actual manager has gone to the US, so we have a temporary manager and this guy doesn't know about the project much, so the c,c++ just fools him.

Can anyone suggest me how I deal with this?
I wanted to finish off the project soon. How can I make him work even by maintaining a good relationship with him?

Responses to comments:


  If he's really deliberately misleading the company, you should report him to management.


I am new to this company and the other guy has been there for many years. And I have just started knowing my colleagues. If I directly go and complaint him, I don't think so I can make good relationship with my other colleagues. Even he has the power to mislead them. I am not telling he is a bad guy, he can do the work, but he is not doing it.


  Doesn't your company have any kind of bug tracking system ? 


Here actual bug tracking system isn't there. The company tries to finish off the project as soon as possible and gives it to the QA. And then fixes the bugs reported by QA. 


  This is why companies should give employees stock / options or some sort of ownership. That way you can literally tell the guy ""You are costing me monetary growth... don't you want to make money also?"".


The company has the stock options they have given me a 2500 share, mostly he too would have got some more.


  Seniority does deserve some benefit of a doubt. You really need to speak to him first and try to understand the problem. He may be out of his depth, you may be able to help him, there could easily be variables you are unaware of. It may be hard now, but you could easily make the situation a lot worse by jumping the gun. 


I even does it, first his app wasn't handling multiple requests at a time, he was using a queue to handle the requests I sent to him. I even suggested to him some of my ideas on it. He said he already had these ideas, and will be executing them. His explanations was: ""Everything require certain time to do and this is a project which may need two years to complete and we are asked to finish it in two months"". I used to have a hard time coding during first few weeks because of this bug. But now he fixed it. But he is using a single queue for a user requests and that is now slowing down the app, since it processes one request at a time.


  What is QA doing this whole time? Why aren't they reporting/confirming the status of the project(s)? 


The manager is the person who decides when to give to the QA. As of now it has not yet given to QA. He said we should give it by this month end.

5684,5684,9012,"""going to"" vs ""will""","I know several questions were asked about the difference between ""going to"" and ""will"".
Based on several answers (see, for instance, here, here and here), I understood that ""will"" is more spontaneous and ""going to"" is used with more planned actions.

So, it seems that everything is pretty fine. However, in this question, Kosmonaut has an answer in which he states:
""Let's say that tomorrow you will walk your dog from 7 - 8 AM"".

On the one hand, you probably planned to walk your dog long before and thus I should use ""Let's say that tomorrow you're going to walk your dog from 7 - 8 am"". 

On the other hand, since I'm saying ""let's say..."", I'm deciding right now (thus, unplanned) that you will walk your dog. So, even though in this hypothetical situation you made a plan, I'm in a more spontaneous mood deciding right now that that's what you will do tomorrow, and, thus, I should use ""will"".

Which one (if any) of the above explanations is right?
",Manoel Galdino,https://english.stackexchange.com/users/21109,"In most contexts, I am going to [verb] and I will [verb] are interchangeable. Sometimes the former may place more emphasis on the fact of your current intention/expectation, where the latter emphasises the future action.

There are some contexts where the difference is clear, and this may have some bearing on why OP thinks there's a planned/spontaneous distinction (usually there isn't). Say you're round a friend's house watching a football match on TV, and at half-time the beer runs out...


  You: ""I'll nip down the shop and get some more beer.""
  
  Friend: ""It's raining - I'll find my umbrella for you.""


If you reply ""Don't bother - I'm going to use my car"", the implication is you had already decided you were going to use the car before you first said you'd get the beer. But if you say ""Don't bother - I will use my car"", this implies you just made that decision in response to what your friend said.

@Peter Shor mentions another context (""It's going to/It will bite!"") where native speakers often make a distinction. In that case, going to usually signifies immediate danger (it's just about to bite), but will can just mean it's bitten others before, and will/may bite you soon if you're not careful (effectively, the same as ""Careful!

5301,5301,8419,How does owning a home and paying on a mortgage fit into family savings and investment?,"I'm in my mid-20's, and so I am aiming at long-term growth with higher risk in my portfolio.  My financial adviser is showing me some investment allocations that put my money in some growth, mid, and value-retention locations.  He doesn't seem to be taking into the equation the fact that I am putting a huge percentage of my paycheck into my home.

I know home values fluctuate, but long term, it seems to be a pretty good way to at least retain value, and at best make a small return.  If I am already contributing so much to my ""home"" investment, why would I also invest in stocks or bonds with a low rate of return, even though they are considered a ""safe"" part of my portfolio?

Update: I think the question really has two parts.

1) How does owning a home fit into my financial portfolio?  Most seem to agree that at best it is a hedge against rent or dollar inflation, and at worst it should be viewed as a liability, and has no place alongside other real investments.

2) How should one view payments on a home mortgage?  How are they similar or different to investing in low-risk low-reward investments?

4271,4271,6808,What is a sci-fi system that would feel familiar to reluctant Pathfinder players?,"For the last few months I've been running a Pathfinder campaign, and recently I told my players that I needed a break and they agreed on switching games for a few months. I'm a fan of the works of Isaac Asimov, Larry Niven and so on, and science fiction would be a great change of pace. So here is my opportunity! At last! Or not?

My problem is my players have never liked anything that isn't D&amp;D or Pathfinder. We're all well into the thirties, and the majority have a taste for long campaigns (they really enjoy character development) and some big differences about what we want in a game. The one player who's also a regular GM has a greater appreciation for new games, but the rest is usually scared off by words like ""indie"", and ""FATE"".

I ran a Traveller campaign years ago using GURPS. They hated GURPS. I took off the GURPS part and added ""Mongoose"". They hated Mongoose. I tried Diaspora. They hate FATE. I talked about Ringworld, but I found BRP is not a good system for sci-fi. Jovian Chronicles? ""It has to be as bad as Tribe 8."" (Their words, not mine). Every time I suggest anything that's not Pathfinder it's the same song.

Though I find Traveller good enough, obviously now it's not an option. My latest reading has been a game based on FUDGE (far enough from FATE) inspired by movies like Alien, Predator and alike. I fear a one-session campaign and new ""hate"". It has to be a game that fits my group. Right?

Of course it may be that there's no such game and I have to deal with my players instead, so ""There is no such game"" is an answer I'll reluctantly accept.

",mister why,https://stackoverflow.com/users/685664,"You want a conversion from the lambda function to boost::function&lt;void(ArgT)&gt; where ArgT is to be deduced. As a general rule, you cannot have type deduction and conversion in the same argument of a function: no conversions take place when deducing a template parameter.

The reasoning behind this is as follows. There are three types involved here: (1) the template parameter, (2) the function parameter type, (3) the passed object type. Two of the types (1 and 2) can be deduced from one another, but both are unknown. If the compiler can assume 2 and 3 are the same type, the problem is solved, but if all the compiler knows is that 3 can be converted to 2 there could be any number of possible solutions, and the compiler is not expected to solve the problem. In practice we know that in this particular case there is only one possible solution, but the standard does not make a distinction between cases.

The rule above applies in all deducible contexts, even if the template parameter can be deduced from another function parameter. The solution here is make the relevant function parameter a non-deducible context, ie a context in which the compiler will never attempt to deduce the template parameter from the function parameter. This can be done as follows:

template &lt;class T&gt; struct identity { typename T type; };

793,793,1259,System for Setting: Misfits,"On the recommendation of one of my players, I'm watching Misfits, a British TV show about kids (Their ages aren't so far specifically stated; they're old enough to drink and young enough to live at home, so late-teens to early 20s, I guess) serving community-service sentences who get super powers. The recommendation included an explicit desire for me to run a game like this.

I'm watching it and thinking about what system to run it in. I want to ask this question more clearly than my last system-for-setting question, so here are some specific points to consider when answering:

WARNING! Spoilers Below!

If you haven't watched the series but plan to, you might not want to read what follows. I tried to separate setting spoilers from the system requirements, but it just didn't work.


The world is gritty and the power level is relatively low. It reminded me of Wild Cards, with ""the storm"" as the catalyzing event. Therefore, the system must support fine gradations in power - the scale is pretty low, so a small advantage needs to be representable.
Powers are uncontrollable - at least at first. Alisha's lust-inspiring power is uncontrolled as far as I have watched, and the immortality power (obviously) works without conscious effort. Curtis' time rewind is a power of huge significance, but it's not controlled by the beginning of the second season either. Therefore the system must support uncontrolled and unreliable powers.
The system you recommend must support regular humans as significant combat threats - Sally gave Simon a real fight. Player character death must be a real possibility.
This is also an ensemble drama, like Buffy, and much of the story is about the changing relationships between the characters.


When answering, please include only one system per answer to facilitate voting.

In your answer please address the following:


How that system fits the given criteria
What special or unique features of the system are particularly suited to driving this style of play

1235,1235,1935,Effective game mechanics for handling conflicts with spirits,"A very effective set piece can be conflict with the spirit world.  A nice example of the kind of thing I am thinking of is from the 1982 Conan film, where the wizard opens a gateway to the spirit world to get demons to revive Conan, and where Valeria fights incorporeal demons to save Conan (YouTube, from 6:45 into the clip to the end &amp; onto next clip).

RQ3 had nice mechanics for dealing with these situations, with shamans who can take characters to the other side through their fetch, spirit combat to handle attacks by hostile spirits, using magic points as an orthogonal measure of strength to hit points.  

AD&amp;D was pretty lousy for this kind of thing back in the day: its distinction between combat involving the incorporeal attribute or in the ethereal and astral realms didn't really work for setting up situations.  But newer D&amp;Ds seem to have better resources, though I've not seen this in action.

What good game mechanics are there for handling conflicts with spirits?

Postscript

The kind of thing game mechanics need, I think, to sustain interest in spirits and spirit combat are:


Spirits are immaterial and that means you have to do different sorts of things to influence them.  E.g., if the best way to deal with an ancient ghost is to chop it up with an axe, that'll spil that atmosphere a bit;
Likewise, spirits are potentially powerful adversaries.  Not very high-powered spells that can get rid of most spirits with a 65% chance of success detract from interest;
Characters can be experts in spirits, and it is good if the nature of those experts draws on resonant real-world and fictional atmospheric devices such as shamans, ancestor worship, fetches, and the like.  It's also good if characters regularly need the services of these figures.

Under the rules for Short Rest (PHB 186):


  A character can spend one or more Hit Dice at the end of a short rest, up to the characters maximum number of Hit Dice, which is equal to the character's level. For each Hit Die spent in this way, the player rolls the die and adds the characters Constitution modifier to it. The character regains hit points equal to the total.


I have a multiclass character - level 1 Monk (d8 Hit Die), levels 2 - 4 Wizard (d6 Hit Die). At the end of a short rest I can spend up to 1d8 and 3d6 Hit Dice to regain hit points.

",limovala,https://mechanics.stackexchange.com/users/3292,"There are two sides to the design and efficiency coin. As a rule of thumb, more modern motors would have better characteristics due to general improvements in manufacturing (machining tolerances are smaller, for instance), and engineering. Liquid-cooled motors are more efficient, as a rule, than air-cooled, and so forth. However, there are also other considerations.

For instance, I have a 250 cc standard motorcycle (Suzuki TU250X). It uses the same basic engine that Suzuki used on its small DR dual-sports, GN standards, and GZ cruisers since early 80s. However, for the new fuel-injected version that Suzuki introduced in the last few years, the newly re-designed top end (cylinder and head) caused it to make less horse-power than earlier carburetted versions (16 v. 20). Why so?

There are multiple factors for such re-design. First of all, the amount of valves were reduced from four to two. Obviously, it would reduce power, because the more, and the bigger the valves, the more air-fuel mixture can be brought in and out. However, the less valves means less maintenance. And for a commuter motorcycle, fuel economy was more important than sheer power.

TU250X engine is designed to give mild and more even power band, that does not peak as high, but allows more useful power and torque at lower RPM one would use most often in regular urban traffic.

1106,1106,1741,Drywall - final joint compound coat,"While remodeling an older house (where nothing is quite straight) we used fiber glass mesh joint tape and 3 coats of joint compound. The first coat was applied with a 4 inch knife, the second with an 8 inch and ending the third on a 12 inch knife. I can still see the texture from the mesh tape I used on some of the joints.

I hoped that a coat of primer would level it off, but after using Kilz 2 primer I can still see the tape in some spots. :(

Sanding through the primer now proves difficult (doesn't work) with a medium grit sanding block.

Should I add another coat? I could never quite get the joint compound to adhere over the mesh tape. I've always been taught to go as thin as I can on the joint compound to reduce the sanding part. Did I go too thin? 

I'm hoping a second coat of primer and 2 coats of the final latex paint hides it, but I know this isn't the right answer. How can I fix this?



following what doresoom and shirlock said; i just applied a coat with the 12 inch knife practically against the wall (accidentally touching the wall with the handle once or twice) - more or less dragging the compound across the surface

this produced the result explained - about 1/32nd ? thickness of mud, covering the tape that i'll need to feather round the edges

i miss spoke earlier - i was using a sponge sanding block (not strait paper sand paper)

now that the primer has dried (did it saturday) its not as bad as i thought it was, but this is the right way to do it (not covering it with paint)

just as a side, we've used sherwin williams paint throughout the house and although its great paint (IMO) the plaster and lath walls that remain, even those repairs show through - and if those do, than this new work will... may as well do finish it right...

thanks for the help guys - i'll check this coat tomorrow and give a last one with the soap and water if it needs it.

What I'm looking to do is hide the button or display a popup message if my custom field is blank.

EDIT: So it looks like Javascript is what I'm looking for since we cannot hide the button.

This is what I have right now when I click a button. It opens up an internal report and passes the parameter that is in the KEY4__c custom field:

Finally, add the resource to your button:

window.$shouldDisable = {!ISBLANK(Object.Field)};
if(window.$shouldDisable) {
    alert(""You must populate the Field before using this button"");

5446,5446,8644,Removing a Viscous Fan without the serpentine belt (1998 Land Rover Discovery),"The PAS pump on my Discovery failed fairly spectacularly last week, shedding it's pulley at the side of the road. In order to get at it to replace it, I need to get the fan off, which requires undoing a left-hand-thread nut in the viscous coupling. 

The problem, however, is that I can't stop the pulley rotating in order to undo it (it's on it's own pulley rather than being on the end of the crankshaft). Normally this would be held in place by the serpentine belt, but without the PAS pulley I can't refit the belt...

Any suggestions? I can't get anything in there to wedge the pulley...

Edit: It's the big bolt in the middle of this part (thanks Paulster2 for the link):


And it is located here on the car:


The big pulley spins freely. I've tried using the small bolts that hold the pulley on for extra purchase - two of the four came undone (great, I thought!), but the other two won't - because of the hexagonal shape of the big nut, I can't get a ring spanner on them, and an open-ended one just started to round them...

          )

It's basically, an array of objects, so you've to treat them that way. For example if I want the name of the the first one:

$myterms = get_terms('taxonomy-name', 'orderby=none&amp;hide_empty');    
echo  $myterms[0]-&gt;name;


If you need to iterate through the elements, you still can use foreach();.

foreach ($myterms as $term) { ?&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""&lt;?php echo $term-&gt;slug; ?&gt;""&gt;&lt;?php echo $term-&gt;name; ?&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;?php
} ?&gt;


That way you can post the articles from your taxonomy.

For the custom post types, you'll have to create a loop like this:

$args = array(
    'post_type' =&gt; 'post-type-name',
    'taxonomy' =&gt; 'term'
    //for example
    //'resources' =&gt; 'videos'
);

//  assigning variables to the loop
global $wp_query;
$wp_query = new WP_Query($args);

// starting loop
while ($wp_query-&gt;have_posts()) : $wp_query-&gt;the_post();

the_title();
blabla....

endwhile;


Then you can create multiple loops each of one for each taxonomy/term :).

If you want to get even more fancy (don't want to repeat yourself a hundred times) you can include the second loop inside the first one and assign variables to the taxonomy (resources ie) and the terms it has (videos) (from your example only the last one). The idea is that you would have a normal (typical) wordpress loop restricted to the custom post-type and each one of the terms.

foreach ($myterms as $term) : ?&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""&lt;?php echo $term-&gt;slug; ?&gt;""&gt;&lt;?php echo $term-&gt;name; ?&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;?php

        $term_name = $term-&gt;slug;

        $args = array(
        'post_type' =&gt; 'post-type-name',
        'taxonomy' =&gt; ""$term_name""
        );

   //  assigning variables to the loop
   global $wp_query;
   $wp_query = new WP_Query($args);

   // starting loop posting only
   while ($wp_query-&gt;have_posts()) : $wp_query-&gt;the_post();

   the_title();
   blabla....

   endwhile;

endforeach; ?&gt;


Obviously you can do the inverse thing too, create the normal loop for a single-template custom type (it's looks like you have only one), and inside includes all the custom terms.

Not very elegant, but that's the best way I can came up with it :P. Hope that someone can understand this, sounds confusing. 

Maybe could it be possible with some callback function?.

2461,2461,3924,Is a VPN really secure at the VPN providers side?,"Please forgive my basic ignorance regarding a VPN connection.

As I understand it, a VPN connection encrypts all the data between my computer and the VPN provider. Thus preventing my ISP from seeing my data.

But on the VPN providers side of the connection, surely the VPN provider uses an ISP of some sort. So they send out requests I have made over their ISP, just as if I were sitting there using the ISP they pay for. And they send the data back to me, encrypted.

So on the ISP side they use, the data they send is unencrypted, so it can be understood by other sites/services.

If this is the case, am I not just pushing my data further along. Its still unencrypted but at a different end (VPNs Webside). Its only the data back to me, which is encrypted.

Thanks.
",FartumPower,https://security.stackexchange.com/users/66617,"Keep in mind that just because some traffic is not flowing inside a VPN doesn't necessarily mean that it is not secure or encrypted. The easy example would be HTTPS: the information you are exchanging with the server is encrypted even if you are not on a VPN. So, no VPN doesn't necessarily equal no security.

A VPN will not make you more secure in terms of anonimity (e.g. if you are trying to perform some not-so-legal operations online), but it will make communications more secure than they would be without it. Sure, the information will be unencrypted sooner or later, but in the meantime, you are encrypting it so that anybody listening on that section of the network will not be able to access your information.

The easy example would be HTTPS: the information you are exchanging with the server is encrypted even if you are not on a VPN. So, no VPN doesn't necessarily equal no security.

A VPN will not make you more secure in terms of anonimity (e.g. if you are trying to perform some not-so-legal operations online), but it will make communications more secure than they would be without it. Sure, the information will be unencrypted sooner or later, but in the meantime, you are encrypting it so that anybody listening on that section of the network will not be able to access your information.

1169,1169,1838,The Probability of Catching Criminals,"I have been struggling with the following question and would greatly appreciate any help  :)


  Suppose we have information about the supermarket purchases of 100 million people. Each person goes to the supermarket 100 times in a year and buys 10 of the 1000 items that the supermarket sells. We believe that a pair of criminals will buy exactly the same set of 10 items at some time during the year. If we search for pairs of people who have bought the same set of items, would we expect that any such people found were truly criminals? Assume our hypothesis to be that a pair of criminals will surely buy a set of 10 items in common at some time during the year. 


This is meant to be an illustration of Bonferroni's principle. Suppose there are no criminals and that everyone behaves at random. Would we find any pairs of people who appear to be criminals?

We must initially find the expected number of pairs who buy the same 10 items per year. I'm not sure whether I do this correctly...

Here is how I've been going about solving it:

Number of possible pairs of people: $\binom{10^6}{2} = \frac{10^{12}}{2} = 5 \times 10^{11}$, using the fact that $\binom{n}{2} \approx \frac{n^2}{2}$, when $n$ is large.

Number of possible 10-item selections: $\binom{10^3}{10} \approx 2.6 \times 10^{23}$

Probability of a customer buying 10 particular items at a point in time:
$\frac{1}{2.6 \times 10^{23}}$

Probability of a customer buying 10 particular items at least once over the course of 100 periods in time: $\frac{100}{2.6 \times 10^{23}}$

Probability of a pair buying exactly the same 10 items (both at least once) over the course of 100 periods in time: $(\frac{100}{2.6 \times 10^{23}})^2 = (\frac{1}{2.6 \times 10^{21}})^2 = \frac{1}{6.76 \times 10^{42}}$

The expected number of pairs who buy the same 10 items per year is thus:

$ 5 \times 10^{11} \times \frac{1}{6.76 \times 10^{42}} = \frac{5}{6.75 \times 10^{31}}$

Because the above number is so low if we do find a pair buying the same 10 items then, under our hypothesis, they are likely to be criminals and not a false positive case. 

I am just wondering whether my solution to the above is correct?
",user1200428,https://math.stackexchange.com/users/72187,"My understanding of the problem is as follows:
Person A has 100 sets of 10 items because he went to the store 100 times in the year. Now the probability that B goes to the store and buys a set that was also bought by A is 
$$
100*\frac{1}{1000\choose 10}
$$

This was for B's one visit. The 100 that we see in the product comes from the fact that A had 100 items. Now we know B also went to the store 100 times so probability that A and B had a same set of 10 items becomes

If the file name is in the directory, I want it to show its contents. If not, I want to show the size in words, lines, and bytes. How do I go about this? So far, I have this:

#!/bin/bash
FILENAME=$FILENAME
FILEBYTES=$(stat -c%s ""$FILENAME"")

Example

Say I have this file:

$ ls -l | grep bbbb
-rw-rw-r--   1 saml saml    3283 May 18 02:49 bbbb


Now I run your script, I called it df.bash. The df command is already taken in Unix:

$ ./df.bash bbbb 
Size of bbbb -- 3283 bytes, 386 words, 94 lines.


Look for a file that doesn't exist:

$ ./df.bash bbbbbbb

Alternative method

You can save some wasted calls by consolidating and having awk do the counting instead of wc.

#!/bin/bash

FILENAME=$1

[ -f ""$FILENAME"" ] || exit

FILEBYTES=$(stat -c%s ""$FILENAME"")
FILEWORDS=$(awk '{ total = total + NF }; END {print total}' ""$FILENAME"")

Dictionary.com's definitions of computation, computing, calculate, and compute are circular, so it doesn't help. 

Wikipedia defines computation to be ""any type of calculation that follows a well-defined model."" 
It defines calculation as ""the deliberate process that transforms one or more inputs into one or more results, with variable change."" But it seems this definition includes many actions as computations even though they aren't typically thought of as computation. 

For example, wouldn't this entail that, say, a bomb exploding is a computation, with the input being the fuse being lighted and the output being the explosion?

2567,2567,4087,How to 'select' menu items that also link to deeper items?,"Currently I'm working on a navigation that doesn't take up too much screen real-estate. I came up with a pseudo off-canvas navigation with stacked menus.

A user can assign nodes to a product. This is the current state of the wireframe; user chose Add nodes. Now he want's to manually search for a specific node 1 (1. Browse Nodes in wireframe). The user now can select a node to add to product 2 or go 1 level deeper into the navigation 3. and 4.. If you click on a node-link the children off that node will slide-in and stack on top of the current menu. There is also a back option to parent (second wireframe).

I deliberately chose checkboxes, links and button as elements because that's their purpose; I wireframed there functionality not a design-solution. Normally I like selecting text/label also checks a checkbox, but now the label is a link too. A user could a) select that node to add to product, Or b) select node to navigate to children of that node.





I could argue if it makes sense that a node will act is a leaf and a branch. A don't have any real data about how customers assign nodes. I can't wait for this input. Currently functionality of the system is that a node could be a leaf and a branch. So asking real users is no option. Maybe in the future (months from now).

How to convert this into an intuitive navigation?
",myradon,https://ux.stackexchange.com/users/41645,"Here are some suggestions:

The title/heading of the first menu layer, 'Search Nodes', is confusing. It might be better just to echo the link the user just clicked to slide out the menu i.e. ""Add Nodes"" 

It feels like you might be over-using checkboxes. The first example of this is next to 'Select previously bookmarked nodes'. A checkbox shouldn't be necessary if there's only one option, and even so, you complicate the interaction here. A checkbox should require one click to select, and another to confirm the choice, whereas a more appropriate element, like a button or a simple link, would only require one. 

Regarding your key question, again, I think your choice of repeating checkboxes and buttons will result in complicated interactions and cluttered UI. 

Here's an alternative solution for your consideration:



(1) An accordion-style menu, with disclosure triangles to reveal deeper options.

(2) Hovering over elements that can interacted with reveals a text link and action. In this case a branch node has already been added (hence the green color and checkmark) so the option is to Remove.

(3) This node has already been added.

(4) Hovering over this leaf node reveals the option to Add.

Of course there are are lots of stylistic variations to this, but it doesn't require multiple slide out menu trays, both leaf and branch nodes can be added/removed, and it doesn't require the repetition of check boxes and buttons.

813,813,1289,Refinance FHA 203k to conventional,"I am thinking of getting a streamlined FHA 203k loan for a home. The loan is for $101,300. The best offer I could find is 4% interest, but because of required insurance fees, I would pay $630.13 a month for 360 months. In the end, I will end up paying $226,846.8. I was told that after a year I could refinance to a conventional loan with a lower rate (currently at 3.75%) and ditch the mandatory FHA mortgage insurance fee (currently $113.05).

Assuming the interest would be lower than what I have now 4%, hopefully staying at 3.75%, would it be wise to refinance after a year so I can loose the $113.05 required mortgage insurance fee and hopefully lower my monthly payments or just keep the loan as it is.

That got me thinking. While I know that Germanic languages have greatly influenced English, so have the Latin and Celtic ones (and various others to a greater or lesser degree). Is it true that more than 50% of the English vocabulary is derived from Germanic roots?

More generally, can someone point me to data on this? I imagine attempts have been made to quantify the contribution of different languages to English; what were the results? What percentage of the language comes from each source?

Ideally I would like to see this expressed in terms of % of words but I am aware that, at least to some linguists, attempting to quantify vocabulary is anathema (to give a simple reason, all languages that allow number construction have an infinite  vocabulary by definition), so alternative approaches to quantifying this are also welcome.

It would just seem really redundant to have to map my database to a more generic data structure and then pass that to my ViewModel to do another mapping (like database -> List -> ViewModel). It would be easier if I could just pass in my query and have 100% of the mapping take place in the ViewModel, instead of having that inbetween step (database -> ViewModel).
",tau,https://stackoverflow.com/users/273270,"We have tried using logic in ViewModels, but this is a path to madness. 

ViewModels should be POCO - only properties with no (or very basic) logic. All the mapping should be done in controller or even in QueryHanlder that is called by a controller. And QueryHanlder would take dependency on DB and do required mapping to get from DB data structure to ViewModel.

Responsibility of ViewModel is to carry data from controller to a view (or backwards). And if you get DB or mapping logic into, this is a violation of Single Responsibility Principle.

4482,4482,7107,Where in the Bible does it say that sacrifice can only be done on the temple?,"This is probably more relevant for Judaism than Christianity. However, I am checking both.

Hezekiah instituted a religious reform that prohibit sacrifice on high places.

The justification is a letter in Leviticus saying that God will ordain the place where He will be worshiped.

The Samaritan think it's Mount Gerissim.

The Jews think it's Jerusalem.

",J. Chang,https://christianity.stackexchange.com/users/933,"The history of the proper locations for offering sacrifices under the Old Testament is like this.  

First before Moses sacrifices could be made anywhere.  Then once the tabernacle was built, Moses received the command of the Lord that sacrifices could only be brought to the  “entrance of the tent of meeting” per Lev 17:


  2 “Speak to Aaron and his sons and to all the people of Israel and say to them, This is the thing that the LORD has commanded. 3 If any one of the house of Israel kills an ox or a lamb or a goat in the camp, or kills it outside the camp, 4 and does not bring it to the entrance of the tent of meeting to offer it as a gift to the LORD in front of the tabernacle of the LORD, bloodguilt shall be imputed to that man. He has shed blood, and that man shall be cut off from among his people. (Lev 17:2-4)


The idea is that making your own sacrifice wherever you wanted after the Lord had provided the proper practice within the tabernacle was as bad a shedding blood of a human and therefore punished as severely. However this law did not seem practical when Israel was about to enter Canaan and be always on the move, therefore this restriction was was temporarily repealed by Moses with an eye to a more permanent re-establishment of it in the temple:

First the plan is to establish the rule in the temple:


  5 But you shall seek the place that the LORD your God will choose out of all your tribes to put his name and make his habitation there. There you shall go, 6 and there you shall bring your burnt offerings and your sacrifices, your tithes and the contribution that you present, your vow offerings, your freewill offerings, and the firstborn of your herd and of your flock. (Deut. 12:5-7, ESV)


Then as this is not yet practical, the concession is granted:


  15 “However, you may slaughter and eat meat within any of your towns, as much as you desire, according to the blessing of the LORD your God that he has given you. The unclean and the clean may eat of it, as of the gazelle and as of the deer. 
  (Deut. 12:15, ESV).


Finally, as this interim period was come to an end and the Temple was about to be ready to replace the tabernacle, the original Lev 17 ordinance was again resumed. As about just this time, for example, we find the reason why people still sacrificed as ‘high places’:


  2 The people were sacrificing at the high places, however, because no house had yet been built for the name of the LORD. (1 Kings 3:2, ESV)


The ‘high places’ although referred to above as simply meaning a place where people sacrificed offering to God, quickly became an offensive term as not only would sacrificing animals there no longer be tolerated as the Temple after the Temple was built, but this was the place where idolatry was also practices to Baal and Ashera idols. Pagans worship their gods there and just like the golden-calf where Israel mixed up the religion of Jehovah with pagan idolatry, so these ‘high places’ became symbols of the same. When Jews worship there is was a corruption and mixture of God and idols. We see a king doing what ‘is wrong’ as leaving those ‘high places’ in tact.


  43 He walked in all the way of Asa his father. He did not turn aside from it, doing what was right in the sight of the LORD. Yet the high places were not taken away, and the people still sacrificed and made offerings on the high places. (1 Kings 22:43, ESV)


When a King did ‘what is right’ he removed the ‘high places’. In fact this became a litmus-test phrase to distinguish good kings from bad ones.


  19 And Josiah removed all the shrines also of the high places that were in the cities of Samaria, which kings of Israel had made, provoking the LORD to anger. He did to them according to all that he had done at Bethel. 20 And he sacrificed all the priests of the high places who were there, on the altars, and burned human bones on them. Then he returned to Jerusalem. (2 Kings Chapter 23:19-20, ESV)

5603,5603,8891,"How to prevent the ""Too awesome to use"" syndrome","When you give the player a rare but powerful item which can only be used once but is never really required to proceed, most players will not use it at all, because they are waiting for the perfect moment. But even when this moment comes, they will still be reluctant to use it, because there might be an even better moment later. So they keep hoarding it for a moment which will never come. 

In the end, they will carry the item around until it is outclassed by other, more readily available resources, or even until the very end of the game. That means that such one-shot items don't provide any gameplay-value at all. They are simply too awesome to use.

I decided that instead of accepting one of them, I decided to collect all ideas from the posts above, summarize them in one answer, and accept this answer as reference for future readers.

Reasons why players hoard:


They develop a habit to solve certain situations using certain tools. When they have a tool which can only be used once, they will never develop a habit for using it. As a result they forget that they actually have this tool.
They don't know what the item is actually doing, so they aren't aware when they are in a situation where it could be useful.
They don't want to do a mistake and prevent further progress by using an item too early.


How to prevent it as a game designer:


Give the player a hint when in a situation where a certain one-shot item would be useful
Make it possible to re-obtain the items after use.
Give the player so many one-shot items, that each individual one doesn't seem that valuable and irreplaceable.
Add severe consequences to dying (more than having to reload the last savegame), so that the player will use one-shot items when desperate.
Don't make them single-use. Add a long cooldown to items instead or allow them to be recharged with another resource, so that the player can use them multiple times.
Make it impossible to hoard them. When the player is aware that they will lose the item anyway, they will use it sooner. This could be done by adding a time-limit, removing them after completing the level or severely limiting the number of items which can be carried at a time.
Punish the player for hoarding too many one-shot items, so that they will be motivated to get rid of them soon.

Give the player so many one-shot items, that each individual one doesn't seem that valuable and irreplaceable.
Add severe consequences to dying (more than having to reload the last savegame), so that the player will use one-shot items when desperate.
Don't make them single-use. Add a long cooldown to items instead or allow them to be recharged with another resource, so that the player can use them multiple times.
Make it impossible to hoard them. When the player is aware that they will lose the item anyway, they will use it sooner. This could be done by adding a time-limit, removing them after completing the level or severely limiting the number of items which can be carried at a time.
Punish the player for hoarding too many one-shot items, so that they will be motivated to get rid of them soon.

147,147,233,Building hand strength for when tapping on the guitar,"I've been practicing on my tapping ability. An example of what I mean by tapping can be viewed here, notice how the right hand hits the strings. 

I'm currently using all four fingers excluding the thumb to tap the guitar. I find my pinky is not as strong as my other fingers when it comes to applying the appropriate strength on the string. What are some exercises I can do to increase my overall finger strength when tapping? More tapping?

As a sidenote, I've noticed that I use the momentum of my forearm to help apply the appropriate pressure on the string I'm trying to hit. If I remove that momentum and only use force created by the movement of my finger the pressure is significantly less. I was hoping these exercises would also help me to not rely on my forearm as much.
",jason328,https://music.stackexchange.com/users/5796,"From my experience &amp; from forum surfing, I can confidently say that your pinky finger will always be weaker than the others.  I have tried the following techniques and think that they can be used to help bridge the gap for you (aside from unfocused tapping):


Tap softer with the other fingers and tap harder with the pinky finger, slowly and cleanly.  Build up speed keeping the sound clean.
Use hand / finger grips to exercise the fingers, focusing on the pinky.  (Gripmaster, Planet Waves, Xtensor, etc.)
Use finger weights.


Place weights on pinky to make it work harder, which will in turn build strength.  Start off light, slow, and clean -- gradually increasing speed.  After a week or so, increase weight and start back slow.  You can alternate between increasing speed and or increasing weight, depending on what you want to train.


If I were you, I would invest in the finger weights.  I have found them very helpful.  You actually feel faster and stronger after playing with them on and then removing them and playing normally.

5027,5027,8003,OpenSSL RAND_poll 'good enough',"We are using OpenSSL for generating IV's and other random data. We initialize it using RAND_poll and, on Windows, RAND_screen. 

The question is though, if the seed generated by those methods is good enough (RAND_screen at least sounds to me like it is). Also, I was wondering how exactly RAND_poll works, as I could not find much documentation about it ant if it does behave differently depending on platform, like RAND_screen which is only available on Windows. 
",inflagranti,https://security.stackexchange.com/users/5239,"RAND_bytes() automatically calls RAND_poll() if it has not already been done at least once. So you do not have to call it yourself. RAND_poll() feeds on what the operating system provides: on Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD and similar Unix-like systems, it will use /dev/urandom (or /dev/random if there is no /dev/urandom) to obtain a cryptographically secure initial seed; on Windows, it will call CryptGenRandom() for the same effect.

4726,4726,7500,Roguelike Class Structure Makes Everything Effectively Global,"A brief rundown of the hierarchy of the game data objects:

Configuration - loaded from XML files, has Descriptors, among other things

Atlas - has a Configuration, has a CreatureInstance(represents the player's creature instance), is an associative array of AtlasColumns

AtlasColumn - has an Atlas(parent), is an associative array of AtlasCells

AtlasCell - has an AtlasColumn(parent), is an associative array of Layers

Layer - has an AtlasCell(parent), is an associative array of LayerColumns

LayerColumn - has a Layer(parent), is an associative array of LayerCells

LayerCell - has a LayerColumn(parent), has a CreatureInstance, a array of ItemInstances, and a TerrainInstance

CreatureInstance/ItemInstance/TerrainInstance - has a LayerCell(parent), has a Descriptor

Descriptor - has an associative array of properties needed by an instance to do its particular function

The most important thing in the Configuration are the Descriptors.  A Descriptor has all of the properties that are needed by the various types of instances. It has properties that drive behavior, what it looks like on screen, and so on.

So here's the part that bothers me:

Everything... EVERYTHING, from Atlas to TerrainInstance can talk up and down the entire chain, the reason being that if, for example, the TerrainInstance is a square upon which a player steps and suddenly a number of monsters are conjured around him, the TerrainInstance needs to have access to the neighboring LayerCells.  Or for another example if a CreatureInstance when attacking the player's CreatureInstance is able to take items from the player's inventory, and relocate them somewhere else in the dungeon, it needs access to a different Layer or AtlasCell in order to put the item where it needs to go.

An alternative that would appear to be ""better encapsulated"" might be a messaging system that sends little message objects up and down the chain and handles things at the appropriate level, but is that really any BETTER than just having the objects be aware of one another?

The game I'm writing started out with mostly hardcoded item and creature types, and gradually morphed its way into something similar to the more flexible roguelike framework that I've detailed above. I'm finally switching from C# to Java for it(the language is immaterial, however), and I'd like to not have missed something glaringly obvious that will cause great pains later when I need to refactor it.

So, the question: is the apparent lack of encapsulation within the data/business objects of the game demonstrate a fatal flaw in the architecture?  And if so, what is that flaw and how can I correct it before I get too far along?
",PlayDeezGames,https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/users/12875,"There's nothing wrong with objects knowing about other objects. That doesn't defy encapsulation.

However, I don't think anything is gained by having CreatureInstance actually store a reference to it's LayerCell. That's a needless coupling of data. It should have a ""location"" type, and Atlas should have a FindCell function that takes this location type.


  Or for another example if a CreatureInstance when attacking the player's CreatureInstance is able to take items from the player's inventory, and relocate them somewhere else in the dungeon, it needs access to a different Layer or AtlasCell in order to put the item where it needs to go.


What you're saying is that the CreatureInstance itself needs to directly do the following:


Detect that it's attack hit the target.
Look in the inventory of the target.
Remove some items form it.
Place those items in the world.


This is highly unnecessary. Why does the CreatureInstance have to do this? Yes, conceptually, it is the creature's attack that causes items to be removed. But why does the CreatureInstance object have to deal with that?

Here's how I would do it.

The CreatureInstance would have one or more Attacks. An Attack is an object that, when successful, can cause one or more effects. Effects include:


Dealing damage, possibly with damage types.
Removing items from the target and placing them on the map.
etc.


All the CreatureInstance has to know is what Attacks it can perform and who it can perform them on. When it decides to use the DrainItemsAttack, it simply says, ""I'm using DrainItemsAttack on this target.""

The DrainItemsAttack would invoke the ""RemoveAndDropItems"" effect. That's not a class; that's a free function (or a static member of some class, since you're using languages that don't allow free functions). It doesn't have to have state, so it doesn't need to be a type. It's just a function that takes some number of inventory items from a CreatureInstance and places them on the ground.

It is that function which needs to be able to inspect inventory, remove items, find suitable terrain to place them on, etc. Each of these operations should be its own function. So your ""RemoveAndDropItems"" effect would be implemented like this (pseudo-code):

bool RemoveAndDropItems(int numToRemove, CreatureInstance target, Atlas world)
{
  for(numToRemove)
  {
    ItemInstance item = target.FindSuitableItemToRemove();
    if(!item)
      return false;
    target.RemoveItem(item);
    LayerCell loc = world.FindSuitableLocationToPlaceItem(item, target.loc());
    world.PlaceItem(item, loc);
  }
  return true;
}


This way, CreatureInstance isn't responsible for finding places to put stuff. You have functions for that. Nor does it have to have knowledge of ItemInstance or other types; that's all taken care of elsewhere.

5085,5085,8091,System for Setting: Misfits,"On the recommendation of one of my players, I'm watching Misfits, a British TV show about kids (Their ages aren't so far specifically stated; they're old enough to drink and young enough to live at home, so late-teens to early 20s, I guess) serving community-service sentences who get super powers. The recommendation included an explicit desire for me to run a game like this.

I'm watching it and thinking about what system to run it in. I want to ask this question more clearly than my last system-for-setting question, so here are some specific points to consider when answering:

WARNING! Spoilers Below!

If you haven't watched the series but plan to, you might not want to read what follows. I tried to separate setting spoilers from the system requirements, but it just didn't work.


The world is gritty and the power level is relatively low. It reminded me of Wild Cards, with ""the storm"" as the catalyzing event. Therefore, the system must support fine gradations in power - the scale is pretty low, so a small advantage needs to be representable.
Powers are uncontrollable - at least at first. Alisha's lust-inspiring power is uncontrolled as far as I have watched, and the immortality power (obviously) works without conscious effort. Curtis' time rewind is a power of huge significance, but it's not controlled by the beginning of the second season either. Therefore the system must support uncontrolled and unreliable powers.
The system you recommend must support regular humans as significant combat threats - Sally gave Simon a real fight. Player character death must be a real possibility.
This is also an ensemble drama, like Buffy, and much of the story is about the changing relationships between the characters.


When answering, please include only one system per answer to facilitate voting.

In your answer please address the following:


How that system fits the given criteria
What special or unique features of the system are particularly suited to driving this style of play


I will not accept answers along the lines of, ""You can do this (or anything) in any system"". They will be downvoted and / or flagged for deletion. This question presupposes that System Does Matter.

5927,5927,9387,"Problem in blitting a clean, crisp sprite","I am having a bit of a tooling problem...and I am unsure of how to solve it.

I am currently using PyGame to try and write a simple Minesweeper clone, except my sprites that I made are hexagon based and therefore have diagonal lines.

I drew up a nice, clean, crisp vector sprite set which looks very nice in Inkscape, however once I export it everything goes to hell.  I'm going to outline what I've done below and hopefully somebody here can set me straight :D

Disclaimer: Unfortunately I'm behind a proxy and cannot provide screenshots at the moment..I'll do my best to describe.

If I attempt to use a color key (0xFF00FF), then when I set the color key in PyGame I get a bunch of jagged pink edges along my sprite.  I believe this could be an anti-aliasing issue with Inkscape, but unfortunately my Googling didn't turn up a way to disable it.

If I import my PNG into Photoshop or the Gimp and delete the background, then I run into an issue where the background appears to be black when running the game.  I have tried to follow the instructions I saw on SO, but to no avail.

I am open to suggestions, but at this point I'm debating importing another library which can handle SVG graphics, in order to keep my clean, crisp diagonal lines.

This word was used by my Brooklyn landlady in the 1980s. Was it in general use at this time?  Also, was it a huge insult? I am writing a novel set at this time and wanted to use it as a light term.

",Valerie Clark,https://english.stackexchange.com/users/96524,"I would not use the term ""Caldoniafied,"" even in a lighthearted way.

A Google search turns up just one match for Caldoniafied and none for Caldoniafy. From Ed Ward, ""Dedicated to You,"" in Greil Marcus, ed., Stranded: Rock and Roll for a Desert Island (1979):


  One night, as they were leaving the backstage of a show, a teenager had called Obediah [Carter, who sang tenor for the ""5"" Royales] ""an old Caldoniafied nigger,"" and the rest of the guys had to hold him back to keep him from outright throttling the kid.


This incident occurred sometime in late 1959 or early 1960. It's not clear to me what exactly the teenager meant by ""Caldoniafied."" Since Louis Jordan sang comic and novelty songs (as the ""5"" Royales often did a decade later), and since Jordan's vocals launched into the high tenor range on ""Caldonia"" (as Carter's did on various songs in the ""5"" Royales repertoire), perhaps the kid was implying that Carter was stealing his singing style from Jordan and that the style was in any case behind the times. Or perhaps the kid simply meant that Carter and the other Royales were hopelessly hardheaded in refusing to adapt to the fundamental changes then occurring in R&amp;B and rock. In any event, the remark didn't sit well with Obediah Carter, and I don't get the impression that the choice of ""Caldoniafied"" as a modifier softened the blow of the ultimate racial epithet.

4343,4343,6918,How do I make certain areas editable?,"I'm new to wordpress and I'm currently converting an HTML/CSS site I made to wordpress to make it easier for my client to edit it from the admin panel.

I have provided 3 screenshots and I'll refer to them here.

The first screenshot shows how my website looks so far. It's using a template I made called homepage.php (see screenshot 3 for code). The template includes header.php which contains the logo, navigation menu etc. It has the image banner and finally includes footer.php. I want the ""Our Values"" part to be editable so that my client can change the text any time they need to. 

Currently, they can edit the top part which says ""PROtential Coaching"" and that's because it's included on the page within the admin panel and not in the template. I want the bottom part including""Our Values"" to be editable from that panel too, is there a way to do this or does this content have to be static and within the template? ""Our Values"" and ""Our People"" are in a dynamic secondary navigation menu which my client can add items to if they want to, however they can't change the content for the menu item.

4025,4025,6427,How to 'select' menu items that also link to deeper items?,"Currently I'm working on a navigation that doesn't take up too much screen real-estate. I came up with a pseudo off-canvas navigation with stacked menus.

A user can assign nodes to a product. This is the current state of the wireframe; user chose Add nodes. Now he want's to manually search for a specific node 1 (1. Browse Nodes in wireframe). The user now can select a node to add to product 2 or go 1 level deeper into the navigation 3. and 4.. If you click on a node-link the children off that node will slide-in and stack on top of the current menu. There is also a back option to parent (second wireframe).

I deliberately chose checkboxes, links and button as elements because that's their purpose; I wireframed there functionality not a design-solution. Normally I like selecting text/label also checks a checkbox, but now the label is a link too. A user could a) select that node to add to product, Or b) select node to navigate to children of that node.





I could argue if it makes sense that a node will act is a leaf and a branch. A don't have any real data about how customers assign nodes. I can't wait for this input. Currently functionality of the system is that a node could be a leaf and a branch. So asking real users is no option. Maybe in the future (months from now).

This means that you don't need to have ranks to use any of the Craft Skills (not limited to Alchemy, Armors, Bows, Traps, Weapons, Varies) or Perform Skills (not limited to Act, Comedy, Dance, Keyboard Instruments, Oratory, Percussion Instruments, String Instruments, Wind Instruments, Sing).

Unfortunately, this does not apply for Profession, and you'll have to get at least 1 rank in a Profession to use it.

It's worth noticing that every failure in a Perform check will give you a -2 when trying to Perform in front of the same audience (because they were not impressed by you and now have prejudices). Be aware of that and use Perform wisely when you don't have ranks in it.



Misc Bonuses

If you don't want to get ranks in these skills, there is still something we can do to improve your checks.

Artisan's Tools: You may want to get these to get a +2 on every Craft check;

Gnome Racial Trait: Gnomes get +2 to a Crafting Skill of their choice.

Masterwork Musical Instrument: If used during the performance, it will grant a +2 on the Perform check.

Skill Focus (feat): Choose a Skill; Without any rank in it, this feat gives you +3 on every check for that Skill (you can get up to +6 when you have 10 ranks, but this is not the case).

2781,2781,4430,"Why Do People ""Pre-empt"" With Seven Of A Suit In Bridge?","One advantage of a ""pre-empt"" is quite clear: You take two levels of bidding away from your opponents with a ""three"" bid. But could that be cutting off your nose to spite your face?

Recently, I had something like KQxxxxx, and a side queen (I forget how the other suits were distributed but was told it didn't matter). My partner was disappointed I didn't ""preempt"" (in ""third"" seat). My response was ""with seven points?""

My understanding is that people often bid three of a suit with seven cards and this little. Sometimes even less, particularly when non-vulnerable vs. vulnerable. In its extreme version, the mantra is ""with any seven (suited) cards.""

",loparr,https://drupal.stackexchange.com/users/4756,"With reference to your question 'optimal way to remove unwanted js and css files from page', hope this approach works ::

1) Include your js &amp; css files only under appropriate hook as per applicable

2) Use syntax like - 

drupal_add_js (drupal_get_path ('module', 'module_name') . '/js/js_file_name.js' 
);
   drupal_add_css(drupal_get_path('module', 'module_name') . '/css/css_file_name.css');

3) You can make use of syntax like this to set some settings variable &amp; check in your js file before invoking your event inside the behavior

In module file ::

drupal_add_js (array ('module_name' => array ('variable_name' => some_value)), 'setting' );

In js file ::


   Drupal.behaviors.testName = {

4) If your code already included js &amp; css files at places which could be done a better way, then you need to make the code changes accordingly. For example,

1232,1232,1929,Is my interval training routine effective for mountain bike training?,"During these winter months I am currently attending the gym 3 times a week. On each of the days I start my training on an exercise bike with the following:


5 minute warm up
30 minutes, 1 minute hard, 1 minute recovery

I am using a specific interval training setting on the bike. I preset the training to level 15, which is a high resistance and as much as I can take.

Hard is a cadence of between 80-90rpm high resistance. Recovery is a cadence of 60prm and the resistance backs off considerably, I imagine to approximately level 7.

My heart rate towards the end of the session reaches 170–190bpm, and I am working flat-out. I turn 30 in March, am 5' 8"" and weigh approx 168lbs.

5382,5382,8548,numpy float: 10x slower than builtin in arithmetic operations?,"EDIT:

I rerun the code under the Windows 7 x64 (Intel Core i7 930 @ 3.8GHz).

Again, the code is:

from datetime import datetime
import numpy as np

START_TIME = datetime.now()

# one of the following lines is uncommented before execution
#s = np.float64(1)
#s = np.float32(1)
#s = 1.0

for i in range(10000000):
    s = (s + 8) * s % 2399232

print(s)
print('Runtime:', datetime.now() - START_TIME)


The timings are:


float64: 16.1s
float32: 16.1s
float: 3.2s


Now both np floats (either 64 or 32) are 5 times slower than the built-in float. Still, a significant difference. I'm trying to figure out where it comes from.

EDIT:

Thank you for the answers, they help me understand how to deal with this problem.

But I still would like to know the precise reason (based on the source code perhaps) why the code below runs 10 times slow with float64 than with float.

EDIT:

numpy.float64 is 10 times slower than float in arithmetic calculations. It's so bad that even converting to float and back before the calculations makes the program run 3 times faster. Why? Is there anything I can do to fix it?

I want to emphasize that my timings are not due to any of the following:


the function calls
the conversion between numpy and python float
the creation of objects


I updated my code to make it clearer where the problem lies. With the new code, it would seem I see a ten-fold performance hit from using numpy data types:

from datetime import datetime
import numpy as np

START_TIME = datetime.now()

# one of the following lines is uncommented before execution
#s = np.float64(1)
#s = np.float32(1)
#s = 1.0

for i in range(10000000):
    s = (s + 8) * s % 2399232

print(s)
print('Runtime:', datetime.now() - START_TIME)


The timings are:


float64: 34.56s
float32: 35.11s
float: 3.53s


Just for the hell of it, I also tried:

from datetime import datetime
import numpy as np

START_TIME = datetime.now()

s = np.float64(1)
for i in range(10000000):
    s = float(s)
    s = (s + 8) * s % 2399232
    s = np.float64(s)

print(s)
print('Runtime:', datetime.now() - START_TIME)


The execution time is 13.28 s; it's actually 3 times faster to convert the float64 to float and back than to use it as is. Still, the conversion takes its toll, so overall it's more than 3 times slower compared to the pure-python float.

My machine is:


Intel Core 2 Duo T9300 (2.5GHz)
WinXP Professional (32-bit)
ActiveState Python 3.1.3.5
Numpy 1.5.1


END OF EDIT

ORIGINAL QUESTION:

I am getting really weird timings for the following code:

import numpy as np
s = 0
for i in range(10000000):
    s += np.float64(1) # replace with np.float32 and built-in float



built-in float: 4.9 s
float64: 10.5 s
float32: 45.0 s


Why is float64 twice slower than float? And why is float32 5 times slower than float64?

Is there any way to avoid the penalty of using np.float64, and have numpy functions return built-in float instead of float64?

I found that using numpy.float64 is much slower than Python's float, and numpy.float32 is even slower (even though I'm on a 32-bit machine).

numpy.float32 on my 32-bit machine. Therefore, every time I use various numpy functions such as numpy.random.uniform, I convert the result to float32 (so that further operations would be performed at 32-bit precision).

Is there any way to set a single variable somewhere in the program or in the command line, and make all numpy functions return float32 instead of float64?
",max,https://stackoverflow.com/users/336527,"CPython floats are allocated in chunks

The key problem with comparing numpy scalar allocations to the float type is that CPython always allocates the memory for float and int objects in blocks of size N.

Internally, CPython maintains a linked list of blocks each large enough to hold N float objects.  When you call float(1) CPython checks if there is space available in the current block; if not it allocates a new block.  Once it has space in the current block it simply initializes that space and returns a pointer to it. 

On my machine each block can hold 41 float objects, so there is some overhead for the first float(1) call but the next 40 run much faster as the memory is allocated and ready.

Slow numpy.float32 vs. numpy.float64

It appears that numpy has 2 paths it can take when creating a scalar type: fast and slow. This depends on whether the scalar type has a Python base class to which it can defer for argument conversion.

For some reason numpy.float32 is hard-coded to take the slower path (defined by the _WORK0 macro), while numpy.float64 gets a chance to take the faster path (defined by the _WORK1 macro). Note that scalartypes.c.src is a template which generates scalartypes.c at build time.

You can visualize this in Cachegrind. I've included screen captures showing how many more calls are made to construct a float32 vs. float64:

float64 takes the fast path



float32 takes the slow path



Updated - Which type takes the slow/fast path may depend on whether the OS is 32-bit vs 64-bit. On my test system, Ubuntu Lucid 64-bit, the float64 type is 10 times faster than float32.

It appears that numpy has 2 paths it can take when creating a scalar type: fast and slow. This depends on whether the scalar type has a Python base class to which it can defer for argument conversion.

For some reason numpy.float32 is hard-coded to take the slower path (defined by the _WORK0 macro), while numpy.float64 gets a chance to take the faster path (defined by the _WORK1 macro). Note that scalartypes.c.src is a template which generates scalartypes.c at build time.

You can visualize this in Cachegrind. I've included screen captures showing how many more calls are made to construct a float32 vs. float64:

float64 takes the fast path



float32 takes the slow path



Updated - Which type takes the slow/fast path may depend on whether the OS is 32-bit vs 64-bit. On my test system, Ubuntu Lucid 64-bit, the float64 type is 10 times faster than float32.

1699,1699,2690,Unusual Differential Equation,"I have the differential equation

$$y''y+n(y')^2=0\tag 1$$

I haven't found any references to equations of this type by searching.  Does anyone have a suggestion as to how to proceed?

It comes about from the following progression:

$$y=(y')^n-\frac 1n\tag 2\\
y'=ny''(y')^{n-1}\implies1=ny''(y')^{n-2}\\
0=n(n-2)(y'')^2(y')^{n-3}+ny'''(y')^{n-2}\\
0=(n-2)(y'')^2+y'''y'$$

Taking $y$ in place of $y'$ and $n$ in place of $n-2$ I get the form shown in $(1)$.  Are there any good ways to solve any of the other intermediate forms, or even the initial form shown in $(2)$?

Further constraints:

$y(0)\approx 1.27$ is an otherwise-unknown constant that I am attempting to build an expression for.

The initial problem is the recurrence relation with $a_1\approx 1.27$ the unknown constant and

$$a_{n+1}=(a_n)^{n+1}-\frac 1{n+1}$$

with the additional constraint $\lim_{n\to\infty}a_n=1$.

2762,2762,4402,"Javascript arrays: Given array[n], get array[n*m]","I'd like to know which would be the best way to solve this problem using javascripts native array methods(map,reduce,etc.). 

Given an array of n objects I want to create another array that will contain m objects for each element in the original array. I can do it using common ""for"" loops to iterate the array but I'd like to know if it can be solved with the native array methods.

Example case:

I have an array with n elements of like ""ObjectA"":

var objectA = {
       name: ""xxx"",
       tels: [""yyy"",""zzz""]
};


I would like to get another array of objects of type ""ObjectB"":

var objectB = {
       name: ""xxx"",
       tel: ""yyy""
};


So in this case, if the first array contained only objectA, the desired result would be:

[
   {
      name: ""xxx"",
      tel: ""yyy""
   },
   {
      name: ""xxx"",
      tel: ""zzz""
   }
]


I've tried using two nested ""map"" calls, but the callback function can only return one element. 

var array1 = [objectA];

var array2 = array1.map(function(objectA){
   return objectA.tels.map(function(tel){
      return {
                 name : objectA.name,
                 tel : tel
              };
   });
});


Returning another array in the callback, generates an array of arrays and it's not what I want. Array2 result:

[
   [
      {
         name: ""xxx"",
         tel: ""yyy""
      },
      {
         name: ""xxx"",

361,361,571,Do real and reactive energy exist?,"Are there any such things as real and reactive energies just like real and reactive power? if so, how is reactive energy dissipated?
",Sri,https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/34625,"First of all, remember that in the context of AC (phasor) analysis, real and reactive power, unlike voltage and current, are not phasors, i.e., they do not represent the amplitude and phase of a sinusoid in the time domain.  Thus, we cannot ""tack on"" the time dependence and take the real and imaginary parts to calculate the associated energies in time domain.  

Sometimes it is helpful to ""go back to basics"" to gain insight into a problem.  This is such a case.  Reactive power is a useful concept in AC analysis but what it represents physically is best seen in the time domain.

First, consider a sinusoidal voltage source \$v_s(t) = V\cos\omega t\$ driving a resistor R.  The power delivered to the resistor is:

$$p_R = \dfrac{v^2_s(t)}{R} = \dfrac{V^2\cos^2\omega t}{R} = \dfrac{V^2}{2R}(1 + \cos2\omega t)$$

The key observation here is that the power is never negative, i.e., the flow of energy is from the source to the resistor always.  Thus, the energy supplied by the source increases over time.

The energy supplied by the source over a period \$\dfrac{\pi}{\omega}\$ is:

$$W_R = \dfrac{\pi V^2}{2\omega R}$$

Now, replace the resistor with a capacitor.  The power delivered to the capacitor is:

$$p_C = v_s(t) \cdot i_C =  V\cos\omega t \cdot (-\omega C)V\sin\omega t = -\dfrac{CV^2}{2}\sin2\omega t$$

The energy supplied by the source over a period \$\dfrac{\pi}{\omega}\$ is:

$$W_C = 0 $$

The key observation here is that the power is alternately and equally positive and negative, i.e., the flow of energy is back and forth between the source and the capacitor.  Thus, the energy supplied by the source over a period is zero.

But, as we know, the power associated with a capacitor is reactive power in phasor analysis, and now we can answer your question:


  Are there any such things as real and reactive energies


We have shown that reactive power is associated with an alternating energy flow between the source and load that is zero over a period.  In other words, it is associated with the energy that ""sloshes"" back and forth between the source and load without any dissipation.

1485,1485,2336,Interpretation of riemannian geodesics in probability,"Good morning everybody. My question is, as maybe already hinted in the title, rather philosopic.

We know that geometric properties of a riemannian manifold can be interpreted in terms of certain evolution processes; I'm thinking about all the relations between the expansion of the heat kernel and, for example, the gaussian curvature of the manifold.

Now, since I'm not a probabilist the question is as follows...

are there characterizations, or properties of riemannian geodesics which can be deduced from stochastic operators (like the Brownian motion)? Even more, can we give a characterization of (properties of) riemannian geodesics in these terms?

All references are welcomed.. this is just a soft question for me to know where I have to look at in literature.

Thanks again for the patience.

4012,4012,6407,Story about Big-Brother-like society where everybody wears a controlling wristwatch,"A future Big-Brother society where people wore wristwatches which both monitored their movements and kept them informed about their role in society. 

I don't remember whether the story was located on Earth or a fictional planet.
The book was read late 60's or early 70's. I only read a small number of authors (max 10) so I would immediately recognise the author's name if the storyline was identified.

Possibilities:
Brian Aldiss,
Piers Anthony,
Isaac Asimov,
Ray Bradbury,
Arthur C. Clarke,
Robert Heinlein,
Frank Herbert,
Ursula K. Le Guin,
Theodore Sturgeon,
Kurt Vonnegut Jr.

But rather than how to get and/or look for internships, my questions concerns of how to filter companies looking for free labor to do their website VS companies that might not offer a paid check, but it will offer you mentorship and skills.

Besides the big software names and elite small software shops, How do you recognize a good internships in non-it-companies(large or small) doing IT maintenance vs the bad ones?

5741,5741,9090,how to calculate intersection time and place of multiple moving arcs,"I have rocks orbiting moons, moons orbiting planets, planets orbiting suns, and suns orbiting black holes, and the current system could have many many layers of orbitage.

the position of any object is a function of time and relative to the object it orbits.
(so far so good).

now I want to know for a given 2 objects(A,B), a start time and a speed, how can I work out the when and where to go. I can work out where A and B is given a time.
so i just need.

1: direction to travel in from A to B(remember B is moving(not in a straight line))
2: Time to get to b in a straight line. 

travel must be in a straight line with the shortest possible distance.

as an extension to this question, how will i know if its better to wait, EG is it faster to stay on object A and wait for a hour when the objects may be closer, than to set off from A to B at the start.

Cheers, it hurt my brain.
",user20733,https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/users/20733,"If your bodies are subject to complex orbits it may well be difficult or impossible to solve using a closed-form expression (solve an equation to get the desired results.

One approach would be to perform a mathematical simulation over time to arrive at a solution.

In your case, a body leaving A at a time t0 travelling in a straight line with velocity v will be somewhere on the circumference of a circle or (sphere in 3D) with radius vt (t=time since leaving). The centre of the circle will be the position of A at the time of launch (Apos(t0)). You can imagine this circle like a ripple on a pond getting bigger over time)

Assuming you can calculate the position of B at time t+t0 (Bpos(t+t0)), you can create a simulation with a loop to find out the earliest time that the growing circle intersects B's path

searching=true
t=0
while(searching){
    if (distance between Apos(t0) and Bpos(t0+t)) &lt; v*t then{

You will of course have to add code to prevent an infinite loop in the case that there is no solution (or no solution to be found in reasonable time).

I see three main possible choices for your game:


Keep all chunks loaded. This is just a big nope.
Keep nearby chunks loaded. For chunks too far away, save the state of the chunk. When coming close to the chunk, load the state again.

This means that the circuit will continue where it left off. Complex circuits won't break this way.
On the downside, the circuit won't run when the player is too far, though this is generally acceptable.

Store active components separately. For chunks too far away, unload the terrain data but keep circuitry active.

This will cause things such as sensors, timers, etc... working all the time.
Bigger resource hit. An infinite world means possibly infinite circuits constantly running.

",Alex,https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/users/2030,"The source of this problem is malformed font files. The internal names of the fonts are in conflict and the flags that indicate connections between the different font files in a typeface family (Regular, Bold, Italic, Bold Italic, etc.) are missing. 

The terminology is awkward. Technically and historically ""Foo"" is a typeface and ""18 pt Foo Bold Condensed"" is a font, but in the era of personal computers the definitions have blurred: a typeface is now often referred to as a ""font"" (even though you'll buy a particular style of that typeface as a ""font"" in any online store), particularly among non-typographers. The variations tend to be called ""styles."" People coming newly (last 25 years or so) into design are so used to scaling a font in software that they forget every size of every style of a typeface was once drawn and made individually.

For a regular application (non-professional) to give you the usual ""Regular, Bold, Italic, Bold Italic"" choices, the font files themselves must be individually named internally and the fact that they are associated is a specific internal flag. It's these internal flags that allow you to create bold or italic text with a keyboard shortcut or style dropdown -- the Foo Bold font file tells the OS ""I am the Bold version of Foo,"" and so on.

You have a situation where all the individual font files have the same internal name, so Windows can't differentiate them. You see exactly one font (style) in a family; delete it, and you see another one, and so on. In Word, Open Office, etc., that's probably all you'll see. (Arial Narrow famously suffered from this problem because of an error in creating the files -- it just wouldn't show up at all, or would never show up as an available style for Arial.) 

Most non-graphics applications natively understand only the usual four fonts in a family. Additional members (narrow, thin, black, extended, etc.) show up as separate typefaces.

More sophisticated applications such as Photoshop or InDesign know how to read the association flags in a set of font files and can display all the variations in a single dropdown. Garamond Premier Pro, as an example, has 39 font files in four optical sizes -- caption, regular, subhead and display -- that all show up in a single dropdown if and only if the files themselves contain the correct internal information. The ones you are having trouble with do not.

The most common source of the problem you are seeing is conversion utilities that don't do a proper job of taking older or other-platform files and turning them into well-formed OpenType or TrueType files. This often affects (illegal, it must be said) Mac --> Windows conversions, because on Mac OS the font information is split between a visible file and a hidden one. If the conversion utility doesn't correctly parse the hidden file, you get a malformed OpenType or TrueType font file that won't work properly on either platform.

677,677,1070,Eclipse C++ formatter puts new line before method identifiers,"I ran into a problem with the Eclipse formatter.  It won't format my code correctly when declaring methods within a class declaration.  It puts a new line after the method's return type.

I already exported the style xml file and examined the settings in it, but none of the settings have any apparent connection to this problem, and the settings editor in Eclipse didn't show the same problem happening in it's sample code for method declarations.

Here is an example bit of code for what I want to have happen:

class MyClass
{
    public:
        MyClass();
        void myMethod();
};


However, this is what I get:

class MyClass
{
    public:
        MyClass();
        void
        myMethod();
};


Again, in the styles editor, the code doesn't have this problem and looks just how I want it to, but in the actual code, the story is different.

I'm using version 3.8.0.  Any help is appreciated.

Edit: I deleted those source files that were formatted incorrectly (after formatting the code several times to no avail) and replaced them with ""identical"" files with the same methods, same structure, etc.  I formatted the code this time and it worked.  This is probably a bug, but I'm leaving it up just in case anyone else encounters a similar problem or has a solution to avoiding this problem in the first place.

5284,5284,8392,When is a mail relay needed?,"Let me expand...

I have a client who is unhappy with their current hosting situation. They want me to move their website and domain across to my hosting platform. I can do this.

However I have realised that the company has:

1) A number of existing IMAP accounts

I understand that I can use a tool like imapsync in order to transfer the mailboxes and hopefully incur only a small amount of downtime with the emails during this process. Can anyone offer any advice regarding the transfer of IMAP mailboxes from one server to another.?

2) An SMTP Relay

Another company supplies my client with an SMTP relay. I've only really just found out what this is. I understand that emails are sometimes undelivered to the client and a mail relay routes incoming mails through another (more reliable?) server in order to keep trying to resend emails so none are missed.

Is this neccessary in this day and age? Does my Plesk 10 Panel Linux Server come with any internal mail relay? Maybe I could use another service like mailjet or elasticemail instead?


Am in in for a lot of hassle moving email accounts or is this a
fairly transparent process?
What should I look out for and how
can I make this hosting transfer seamless (or nearly seamless)?
When I move the domain to my server (and the IP changes) this will interrupt the current mail relay. Will my client's emails continue to be delivered?

  The EFL learner is advised to use [ðə] before a consonant sound (the
  boy, the house), [ði] before a vowel sound (the egg, the hour). Native
  speakers, however, sometimes ignore this distribution, in particular
  by using [ðə] before a vowel (which is in turn usually reinforced by a
  preceding ʔ), or by using [ði:] in any
  environment, though especially before a hesitation pause. Furthermore,
  some speakers use stressed [ðə] as a strong form, rather than the
  usual [ði:].


My question is: when native speakers use [ðə] instead of [ði] before a vowel sound, do they do it on purpose or accidentally? If it is on purpose, how do they (typically) decide which pronunciation to use? What is a valid reason to use [ðə] before a vowel sound?

They are a great space saver, and somewhat environmentally friendly as the oil/energy required to make one glass preserving jar can make 50 to 100 of these bags. And how many preserving jars survive 50 times without breaking!

You will find plenty of sources on the Internet, typical prices $50 to $200 per 1000

The process varies from each bag supplier and vacuum system, but is similar to normal home preserving

If you get the foil lined (light proof) pouches they will preserve food for many years

3986,3986,6364,Weren't there originally going to be nine Star Wars films?,"I seem to remember reading that there were going to be three trilogies originally in Star Wars, i.e. they would add episodes 7 - 9.

Was that ever the case? What happened to that plan?

Update: looks like that original plan might be back after all!
",Wikis,https://scifi.stackexchange.com/users/143,"Some fantastic answers here, but I thought I'd just add a little more detail, that I don't think has been included in any of the others. Firstly, as has already been said, STAR WARS was only ever one film. Vader wasn't Luke's father, Leia wasn't Luke's sister, no further films were planned.

Even the original 1977 opening crawl looked like this:



That's right. No ""Episode IV : A New Hope"".

It's difficult to remember now, but STAR WARS was HUGE. I mean TITANIC big. Adjusted for inflation it's actually still the second highest grossing movie of all-time (AVATAR is only number 14).

So Lucas and his friends set to work on expanding the universe, much like the Wachowski's did with THE MATRIX. Lucas's ""second in command"", from the beginning of his Hollywood career, was a man called Gary Kurtz. Kurtz produced Lucas's first ""Hollywood"" feature, AMERICAN GRAFITTI, which in itself was a big success (currently 44 on the highest grossing films of all time list), STAR WARS, and THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK.

Lucas worked with Kurtz (and many others) on producing a rough outlines for approximately 8 more movies, making 9 in total. The EMPIRE STRIKES BACK was made according to this plan.

After the success of RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK (the project Lucas put together with Steven Spielberg), Lucas decided that cinema-goers wanted more of a rollercoaster action movie, and so changed the 9 movie plan.

Kurtz and Lucas were at logger-heads over a lot of things. Some of them technical, some of them artistic. According to Kurtz they agreed they should go their separate ways before RETURN OF THE JEDI began, with Kurtz taking the opportunity to work with Jim Henson on THE DARK CRYSTAL.

However, since Kurtz was so intricately involved in the evolution of STAR WARS into something bigger, he's a great source. According to him, the outlines for the nine movies went like something this:


  
  EPISODE 1: Was to focus on the origins of the Jedi Knights and how they are initiated and trained
  EPISODE 2: Introduction and development of Obi-Wan Kenobi
  EPISODE 3: Introduction and life of Vader
  EPISODE 4: There were seven different drafts of the film. At one point, they pursued buying the rights to Hidden Fortress because of the strong similarities. At one point, Luke was a female, Han was Luke's brother, Luke's father was the one in prison (interesting point for some debates) and the film featured 40 wookies
  EPISODE 5: Once written, the screenplay of Empire is almost exactly what is seen on screen. The only cut scenes were those involving wampas in the rebel base (cut because of time and unsolved technical glitches) and about two minutes of Luke/Yoda Jedi training with no real dialog.
  EPISODE 6: Leia was to be elected ""Queen of her people"" leaving her isolated. Han was to die. Luke confronted Vader and went on with his life alone. Leia was not to be Luke's sister.
  EPISODE 7: Third trilogy was to focus on Luke's life as a Jedi, with very few details planned out.
  EPISODE 8: Luke's sister (not Leia) appears from another part of the galaxy.
  EPISODE 9: First appearance of the Emperor.
  


(I believe he went into greater detail in an issue of SFX magazine, but I've been unable to find a copy of the text on the internet... I bet it's there somewhere!)

There's also a great interview with Kurtz here, where he goes into a bit more detail:


  The one story thread [in Return of the Jedi] that got totally tossed out the window, which was really pretty important I think, was the one of Vader trying to convince Luke to join him to overthrow the Emperor. That together they had enough power that they could do that, and it wasn’t him saying I want to take over the world and be the evil leader, it was that transition. It was Vader saying, “I’m looking again at what I’ve done and where my life has gone and who I’ve served and, very much in the Samurai tradition, and saying if I can join forces with my son, who is just as strong as I am, that maybe we can make some amends.” So there was all of that going on in Jedi as well, that was supposed to go on. So the story was quite a bit more poignant and the ending was the coronation of Leia as the queen of what was left of her people, to take over the royal symbol. That meant she was then isolated from all of the rest and Luke went off then by himself. It was basically a kind of bittersweet ending. She’s not his sister that dropped in to wrap up everything neatly. His sister was someone else way over on the other side of the galaxy and she wasn’t going to show up until the next episode.

3793,3793,6030,Kendo UI grid popup now working after AJAX data,"I have a kendo grid which has data populated via AJAX. 

If I take out the AJAX all is fine but when I populate the data via AJAX the edit button doesn't bring up the pop up. 

The grid itself looks like this: 

&lt;div id=""DefinedLevelsGridContainer""&gt;
@(Html.Kendo().Grid(Model.Where(x =&gt; x.OrgLevel == 0).First().DefinedFieldsList)
    .Name(""DefinedlevelsGrid"")
    .Columns(columns =&gt;
    {
        columns.Bound(x =&gt; x.FieldName).Title(""Name"");
        columns.Bound(x =&gt; x.FieldTypeText).Title(""Type"");
        columns.Bound(x =&gt; x.isMandatory).Title(""Mandatory"");
        columns.Bound(x =&gt; x.DefaultValue).Title(""Default Value"");
        columns.Bound(x =&gt; x.UpdatedOn).Title(""Updated"");
        columns.Command(command =&gt; { command.Edit(); command.Destroy(); });

    .Update(update =&gt; update.Action(""Update"", ""Home""))
    .Destroy(destroy =&gt; destroy.Action(""Destroy"", ""Home""))
    )
)




As you can see I am populating it, by default, with the first item in a list of data. 

I then have this: 

$(window).load(function () {
    $("".LevelSelector:first"").click();
});


Which calls the following function: 

$("".LevelSelector"").click(function () {
        var rootString = $(this).html();
        var splitString = rootString.split(""-"");
        var levelGuid = $(this).attr(""LevelGuid"").toString();

        $(""#LevelEditName"").text($.trim(splitString[0]));
        $(""#LevelEditInput"").val($.trim(splitString[1]));
        $(""#CreatedOn"").text($(this).attr(""CreatedDate""))
        $(""#CreatedBy"").text($(this).attr(""CreatedBy""))
        $(""#UpdatedOn"").text($(this).attr(""UpdatedDate""))
        $(""#SelectedLevelGuid"").text(levelGuid)

        var Url = '@Url.Action(""GetLevelFields"", ""OrganisationAJAX"")' + '?LevelGuid=' + levelGuid;

        $.ajax({
            url: Url,
            contentType: ""application/json; charset=utf-8"",
            type: 'POST',
            context: this,
            timeout: 60000,
            dataType: 'json',
            tryCount: 0,
            retryLimit: 3,
            success: function (data) {

                var grid = $(""#DefinedlevelsGrid"").data(""kendoGrid"");
                grid.dataSource.data(data);
            },
            error: function (httpRequest, textStatus, errorThrown) {
                $("".Message"").text(""Error: "" + textStatus + "" "" + errorThrown);
            }
        });
    });


The first part is populating another part of the page and then it does an AJAX call to go and get the data. On success it populates the grid. 

That all works. 

But when I click on edit it doesn't load the grid. It does move to the top of the page so I know it is firing. 

If I stop the pre population by AJAX it does load up the template so I know the template isn't at fault. 

Does anyone have any ideas? 

Many thanks in advance.

275,275,441,does re-encrypting the same value with multiple keys reduce security,"I found myself wondering today, how much security is lost if you take a plaintext - assume that its content, including any metadata is unknown to an attacker, for example it may be random data - and encrypt it with multiple keys (not chained) and give all resulting ciphertexts to an attacker, how much higher is the probability of an attacker discovering the plaintext, vs only having a single ciphertext. 

An example:

Take plaintext $P_1$ and encrypt it with $K_1$, and send the resulting ciphertext $C_1$ to attacker $A_1$.

In addition: take the same plaintext $P_1$ and, and encrypt it with $K_1$, giving $C_1$. Then take $P_1$ and encrypt it with $K_2$ giving $C_2$, then $K_n$ giving $C_n$ and send all $n$ ciphertexts to attacker $A_2$.

",Zack Newsham,https://crypto.stackexchange.com/users/13023,"The ""security"" of an encryption scheme is commonly defined through a so called indistinguishability games, i.e. the attacker picks two messages of same length. You pick one of those two at random, encrypt it, and give it to the attacker. 
If the scheme is ""secure"", then the attacker's advantage of guessing which messages was encrypted should not be negligibly bigger than pure guessing, i.e. 1/2. This kind of security notion comes in different flavours like CPA, CCA1, and CCA2.

If a private or public key encryption scheme is secure against CPA, CCA1, or CCA2, then it will also be secure against the same games, where instead of giving two messages, the attacker gives you two message vectors and you encrypted one of them. This is proven with a standard technique called hybrid argument, which basically shows that if you can win a game with vectors of messages, then you can also win it where the attacker only outputs two messages.
Very roughly speaking you create a reduction, where your attacker guesses a position in the vector and inputs the challenge from the two message game. The probability of guessing the ""correct"" position in the vector is non-negligible if your vector is of polynomial length. There are plenty of books (e.g. the one by Katz &amp; Lindell) or online resources that explain this in depth, so I won't reiterate it here.

In short: If something is secure w.r.t. to for instance CPA, then it will also be secure if you obtain encrypted message vectors (or as you state where one message is encrypted under multiple different keys). The success-probability might change, but only by a very small (still negligible) amount, so nobody cares, since it's still secure w.r.t to the notion.

If a trigger is not firing, then the insert/update/delete of the SObject is failing before the trigger is being invoked. For example, an after insert/update trigger will not fire if there are validation rule errors during the insert/update.

I would like to help set up a small business (~50 employees) with Asterisk, but I am not very familiar with how the whole T1, data/voice channels, etc work.

Are there any resources out there to help me understand what may be needed of me to help set this business up with Asterisk and re-use their existing T1 pipe?

Any help would be greatly appreciated.
",Benny,https://serverfault.com/users/42248,"Solid answer by @Bittrance already.

My main highlights for a new to all this 'VoIP guy for a small office' would be:

Server setup:


Consider buying an appliance with a nice GUI. Several vendors make 'Asterix bundled with hardware' packages, like the ""Asterisk Appliance 50"" or ""Trixbox"".
If not an appliance, then at least consider a nice virtual machine / server software image (OS + Asterix + Addons + GUI) like AsteriskNOW, Trixbox, etc.


Upstream connection:


You can use an IP based telephony service provider, i.e. send SIP VoIP data over the T1 to your telephony service provider. This is where much of the business innovation, low telephony rates etc can be had. In a good design, you want QoS on the upstream (T1) line, to guarantee good voice quality in all conditions.
You can use a traditional telephony service provider, and use ISDN/2, ISDN/30, or multiple analog lines to connect to your upstream service provider. This is very reliable, time-proven, and doesn't have any QoS needs as you are not mixing data and voice on the same physical circuit.


QoS:


""Quality of Service (QoS) is the biggest design issue. QoS, at very high level, refers to the ability to prioritize data flows though shared pipes, i.e. make sure voice traffic gets priority over computer data.
How to best implement QoS in a given network is very dependent on what equipment is being used.
In a few cases, the simplest/cheapest QoS solution is to just use 2 physical circuits -- one for data, and another for voice. For example, some small offices use a new high-speed FiOS package for Internet connectivity/data, and an old T1 or something for voice uplink. The most cost-effective option will depend on what is being offered in your area, and the QoS capabilities of your existing firewall/router.
You should go for QoS on your internal network too. That's not so hard; the common solution is setting up dedicated VLANs for voice and data, and using the QoS implementations in your (managed Cisco) switch. Some really cheap installations use 2 switches, one dump ~30 USD switch for data/PCs, and another dumb switch for SIP phones exclusively. That works too, but is inelegant and can lead to lots of cable runs.


Phones:

I want to help build a small business with an asterisk (about 50 employees), but I'm not familiar with the whole T1, data / voice channels, etc. I've built a personal asterisk server (functional), but I haven't used a T1 like conduit (sounds more complex than a residential cable / DSL).","Solid answer by @Bittrance already.

My main highlights for a new to all this 'VoIP guy for a small office' would be:

Server setup:


Consider buying an appliance with a nice GUI. Several vendors make 'Asterix bundled with hardware' packages, like the ""Asterisk Appliance 50"" or ""Trixbox"".
If not an appliance, then at least consider a nice virtual machine / server software image (OS + Asterix + Addons + GUI) like AsteriskNOW, Trixbox, etc.


Upstream connection:


You can use an IP based telephony service provider, i.e. send SIP VoIP data over the T1 to your telephony service provider. This is where much of the business innovation, low telephony rates etc can be had. In a good design, you want QoS on the upstream (T1) line, to guarantee good voice quality in all conditions.
You can use a traditional telephony service provider, and use ISDN/2, ISDN/30, or multiple analog lines to connect to your upstream service provider. This is very reliable, time-proven, and doesn't have any QoS needs as you are not mixing data and voice on the same physical circuit.


QoS:


""Quality of Service (QoS) is the biggest design issue. QoS, at very high level, refers to the ability to prioritize data flows though shared pipes, i.e. make sure voice traffic gets priority over computer data.
How to best implement QoS in a given network is very dependent on what equipment is being used.
In a few cases, the simplest/cheapest QoS solution is to just use 2 physical circuits -- one for data, and another for voice. For example, some small offices use a new high-speed FiOS package for Internet connectivity/data, and an old T1 or something for voice uplink. The most cost-effective option will depend on what is being offered in your area, and the QoS capabilities of your existing firewall/router.
You should go for QoS on your internal network too. That's not so hard; the common solution is setting up dedicated VLANs for voice and data, and using the QoS implementations in your (managed Cisco) switch. Some really cheap installations use 2 switches, one dump ~30 USD switch for data/PCs, and another dumb switch for SIP phones exclusively. That works too, but is inelegant and can lead to lots of cable runs.


Phones:

1710,1710,2709,Roguelike Class Structure Makes Everything Effectively Global,"A brief rundown of the hierarchy of the game data objects:

Configuration - loaded from XML files, has Descriptors, among other things

Atlas - has a Configuration, has a CreatureInstance(represents the player's creature instance), is an associative array of AtlasColumns

AtlasColumn - has an Atlas(parent), is an associative array of AtlasCells

AtlasCell - has an AtlasColumn(parent), is an associative array of Layers

Layer - has an AtlasCell(parent), is an associative array of LayerColumns

LayerColumn - has a Layer(parent), is an associative array of LayerCells

LayerCell - has a LayerColumn(parent), has a CreatureInstance, a array of ItemInstances, and a TerrainInstance

CreatureInstance/ItemInstance/TerrainInstance - has a LayerCell(parent), has a Descriptor

Descriptor - has an associative array of properties needed by an instance to do its particular function

The most important thing in the Configuration are the Descriptors.  A Descriptor has all of the properties that are needed by the various types of instances. It has properties that drive behavior, what it looks like on screen, and so on.

So here's the part that bothers me:

Everything... EVERYTHING, from Atlas to TerrainInstance can talk up and down the entire chain, the reason being that if, for example, the TerrainInstance is a square upon which a player steps and suddenly a number of monsters are conjured around him, the TerrainInstance needs to have access to the neighboring LayerCells.  Or for another example if a CreatureInstance when attacking the player's CreatureInstance is able to take items from the player's inventory, and relocate them somewhere else in the dungeon, it needs access to a different Layer or AtlasCell in order to put the item where it needs to go.

An alternative that would appear to be ""better encapsulated"" might be a messaging system that sends little message objects up and down the chain and handles things at the appropriate level, but is that really any BETTER than just having the objects be aware of one another?

The game I'm writing started out with mostly hardcoded item and creature types, and gradually morphed its way into something similar to the more flexible roguelike framework that I've detailed above. I'm finally switching from C# to Java for it(the language is immaterial, however), and I'd like to not have missed something glaringly obvious that will cause great pains later when I need to refactor it.

So, the question: is the apparent lack of encapsulation within the data/business objects of the game demonstrate a fatal flaw in the architecture?  And if so, what is that flaw and how can I correct it before I get too far along?
",PlayDeezGames,https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/users/12875,"I've been designing my roguelike framework on and off for the past few years and I come to think that the traditional OOP approach doesn't provide a very useful abstraction for a typical roguelike world for the reasons that you mentioned - everything is so interdependent on each other that each class may potentially need to know about every other class. 

For example, AI routines should logically be a part of the Creature class, but AI potentially needs to know everything - the current dungeon map, the state of PC's quests, current World events etc. Even implementing simplest actions such as moving isn't straightforward: do you have a Creature.move(x,y) method and require every Creature object to know its current dungeon level, OR you have a DungeonLevel.moveCreature(creature, x, y) method?

4534,4534,7185,event horizons are untraversable by observers far from the collapse?,"Consider this a followup question of this one

In the classical schwarszchild solution with an eternal black hole, the user falls through the event horizon in finite local time, but this event does take place for distant observers in the infinite future. As Leonard Susskind explains, measurements of objects near the horizon are subject to large uncertainties, since all the radiation used to see them is largely red-shifted and received in increasingly large intervals in the future. This is why in some still vaguely defined sense, the effective event horizon grows, even if no matter has actually yet crossed the original event horizon (the stable event horizon after the black hole collapse period)

But when the event horizon radiates, the event horizon must recede faster than any infalling observer. Any infalling matter will probably be still stir-fried by the hawking radiation over the eons the evaporation takes (which in the observer frame is intensely blue shifted). The only matter that ever gets to be inside the formal event horizon (not the effective horizon) before the final evaporation is the matter that was already in the original collapsing star, around which the event horizon formed

Is there still any room to say otherwise? can still be argued that matter will fall in the event horizon in finite time for distant observers (faster than the evaporation will shrink the event horizon)?
",lurscher,https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/955,"It's key to remember that the observer outside of the black hole will never see you fall into the black hole.  However, this observer can jump into the black hole himself, and see what happened to you.  Outside of the black hole, since he is unable to receive light signals from you, he may say that you have stopped at the event horizon.  But since he can go in and see you (assuming you haven't been crushed by the singularity yet), it is a matter of philosophy of whether the infalling observer actually fell in or if he 'froze' at the event horizon.

Analogy: If you are accelerating in a rocket, you don't have to believe that time on earth slowed to a stop corresponding to your Rindler horizon. If you wish, you can conclude no such thing. However, it is indisputable that no signals from earth past a certain time will reach you as long as you continue accelerating. But you can stop accelerating and then see what you missed. Similarly, you can 'stop accelerating away from the SC horizon' - i.e. fall into it - and then see all the history of infaller's you missed.

1135,1135,1779,STFT - DFT size of the bins,"Having some trouble understanding this concept, really could do with some advice.

I want my STFT to have the following parameters: NFFT = 256 overlap/hop = 128

Now essentially, the algorithm will work as follows:

1) Split the signal into blocks of 256 


This will result in around 72*265:

2) For each of these blocks, calculate against the Hanning Window 

3) Create a ""slider"" that does an overlap of 128.. So, in theory it would 
   therefore be: `size = 256 + 128` 


Therefore, when I'm computing the DFT for each of the overlapped blocks, will my FFT remain at size 256 or will the size be 256 + 128 If this is the case, does each block in the resulting vector still have to be of size 256?

Thanks  

EDIT: 

This is now my result:



But, compare this to a spectrogram in matplotlib



Where am I actually going wrong? I cannot make any sense of this. 

I've looked bat through all the data, the blocks are correctly overlapping, Hanning window is being applied correctly.

Could it be to do with the fact I'm using a 1D DFT? I.e. 

std::vector&lt;complex&gt; FFT-&gt;transform(complex_vector[0...n], 256);

",Phorce,https://dsp.stackexchange.com/users/5182,"For a non-zero overlap, the size of each FFT will remain exactly the same.  However some of the data points used in each successive FFT will be from the previous FFT window, thus allowing less completely new data points to make up the final length to be fed to that successive FFT.  Thus more overlap will create a larger number of blocks.

For an overlap of 128, the 2nd FFT uses 128 points from the end of the first FFT, and adds 128 new points from the data stream, to make up a total of 256 data points, the same length as the first FFT.

3983,3983,6359,Complexity class of an idealised version of Bitcoin's proof-of-work (hashcash)?,"To formulate this question precisely, I will define an idealized hypothetical ""perfect"" hash function $H(n)$ which has nice scalability properties, and will formulate a problem PERFECT HASHCASH in terms of that, understanding that practical considerations may end up yielding only an approximation of this ideal.

To keep it simple, we will say that our hash function $H(n)$ takes as input a single natural number $n$. Then we say that $H(n)$ is a perfect hash function iff:


$H:\mathbb N \to \{0,1\}^\infty$; That is, $H$ maps each natural number to an infinite binary sequence, and which the time complexity to compute any initial segment $s$ is polynomial in the size of $n$ and $s$, (making it a sponge function).
For any initial segment of length $d$, the set of all natural numbers $n$ such that $H(n)$ shares that initial segment has natural density $2^{-d}$.


The first thing formalizes the scalability of our function, and the second thing formalizes the idea that we want all hashes to appear roughly ""equally often"" as an output. Other than that, our perfect hash function is a black box, and we don't care much about exactly how it works, so long as it meets the above properties, as well as the usual desiderata applying to hash functions (easy to compute, hard to invert, hard to find collisions, etc).

Predicated on the assumption that a perfect hash function exists, we can now define the problem PERFECT HASHCASH as follows: PERFECT HASHCASH takes as input a perfect hash function $H$, a natural number $n$, and the zero vector $0^d$ of length $d$, which can be thought of as a unary representation of $d$. A solution to PERFECT HASHCASH consists of an $n$ and $d$ such that $H(n)$ starts with $0^d$.

Given those inputs, it is clear that PERFECT HASHCASH is in the complexity class TFNP, since this is a function problem and a solution is guaranteed to exist.

Can we also identify PERFECT HASHCASH as a member of any complexity class finer than TFNP?

Could it perhaps be in PPP? PPA? PPAD? Something else?

  Additionaly, Database Mail is scalable because it uses the Service Broker queue, which allows the requests to be handled asynchronously and even saves the request if the server goes down before it can be handled.


Maybe I'm too off base here, but, is there a way I can send messages directly to the Database Mail queue using Service Broker?

If I have to set up a stored procedure for sending an e-mail on behalf of Service Broker, I think it should be easier to just setup a job on the SQL Server Agent to check for the events I'm interested in inside the error log and send the operators an e-mail.

Then do just that. Create an activated stored procedure on the queue of your service that receives the notifications and have it RECEIVE the message and invokes sp_send_dbmail.

To me, it seems most important to give users the option to opt out of the walkthrough. Some little no thanks button to exit the walkthrough should suffice. 

The users that are annoyed by the walkthrough are most often those, that know the service and feel like they will not profit from it - so the percentage of ""helpless"" users actually going through the walkthrough and profiting from it will remain high, while the negative feedback from ""versed"" users already somewhat familiar with your product will go down as they can opt out.

5743,5743,9092,How to find first element of array matching a boolean condition in JavaScript?,"I'm wondering if there's a known, built-in/elegant way to find the first element of a JS array  matching a given condition. A C# equivalent would be List.Find.

So far I've been using a two-function combo like this:

// Returns the first element of an array that satisfies given predicate
Array.prototype.findFirst = function (predicateCallback) {
    if (typeof predicateCallback !== 'function') {
        return undefined;
    }

    for (var i = 0; i &lt; arr.length; i++) {
        if (i in this &amp;&amp; predicateCallback(this[i])) return this[i];
    }

    return undefined;
};

// Check if element is not undefined &amp;&amp; not null
isNotNullNorUndefined = function (o) {
    return (typeof (o) !== 'undefined' &amp;&amp; o !== null);
};


And then I can use:

var result = someArray.findFirst(isNotNullNorUndefined);


But since there are so many functional-style array methods in ECMAScript, perhaps there's something out there already like this? I imagine lots of people have to implement stuff like this all the time...

315,315,507,How to enable or disable services?,"I read about how to enable and disable services in Ubuntu and it seems that there are different possibilities to manage them.

The first method I found is update-rc.d to add new services to startup, which aims on the /etc/init.d folder and its contents.

The other one I found is to edit .conf files in the /etc/init folder.

What's the recommended way to enable / disable / add services and why?

Could you please give a short bulletproof step by step example on how to add a service in Ubuntu and enable and disable it?
",NES,https://askubuntu.com/users/7155,"Currently there are actually 2 different ways for software to be started as a service in Ubuntu. A service is defined here as a program run by the system in the background, as opposed to one started and run directly by the user.

The traditional way to start services in Linux was to place a script in /etc/init.d, and then use the update-rc.d command (or in RedHat based distros, chkconfig) to enable/disable it. This command, btw, uses some mildly complicated logic to create symlinks in /etc/rc#.d, that control the order of starting services. If you run ls /etc/rc2.d you can see the order that services will be killed (K##xxxx) and started (S##xxxx).

The issue with that was that when booting the system, everything had to be done in serial, one thing after another, making system boot times really slow. Attempts were made to parallelize this, but they were haphazard and hard to take full advantage of. This was the main reason that Upstart was created.

Upstart uses job definition files in /etc/init to define on what events a service should be started. So, while the system is booting, upstart processes various events, and then can start multiple services in parallel. This allows them to fully utilize the resources of the system, for instance, by starting a disk-bound service up while another CPU-bound service runs, or while the network is waiting for a dynamic IP address to be assigned.

You can see all of the upstart job files by running ls /etc/init/*.conf

Let me just stop here and say that if you don't know what a service is, or what it does, DO NOT disable it!

Not all services have been converted to upstart. While working on the server team at Canonical for the past few months, I've worked on a number of converted job files, and the nicest part is that it allows one to get rid of all the script ""magic"" and just put in a few commands here and there to define exactly how to start the service, and nothing more. But for now, only a handful of traditional network services, like squid and samba, have been converted.

In order to figure out if a service is upstart based, you can run the status command:

status servicename


If its an upstart job, it will show this:

$ status statd
statd start/running, process 942


But if its not, you'll see something more like this:

$ status apache2
status: Unknown job: apache2


In this case, apache2 has not been converted to upstart. So, to disable apache2 you just run

sudo update-rc.d apache2 disable
sudo service apache2 stop


Upstart job definitions do not have an update-rc.d command. To disable the job, you need to edit the job file directly to disable it. There are two ways to do this.

If you want to still be able to manually start it, then you need to comment out the 'start on' condition. Say you want to install samba, but not have it start automatically.. here is its job file (in natty):

description ""SMB/CIFS File Server""
author      ""Steve Langasek &lt;steve.langasek@ubuntu.com&gt;""

start on local-filesystems
stop on runlevel [!2345]

respawn

pre-start script
    RUN_MODE=""daemons""

    [ -r /etc/default/samba ] &amp;&amp; . /etc/default/samba

    [ ""$RUN_MODE"" = inetd ] &amp;&amp; { stop; exit 0; }

    install -o root -g root -m 755 -d /var/run/samba
end script

exec smbd -F


To disable it, you can just put a # in front of the 'start on local-filesystems'. Note that while it won't start back up on boot, you still need to stop it this time with

sudo service smbd stop


If, however, you never want it to start, I'd suggest actually removing the package. If, however, you want it installed, but not startable, you can also do:

mv /etc/init/smbd.conf /etc/init/smbd.conf.disabled


Starting with the version of upstart that will be in 11.04, there is a new keyword that disables the 'start on' and 'stop on' stanzas, it is 'manual'. So another way to disable the service as of 11.04 is to do:

command using sudo
echo 'manual' | sudo tee /etc/init/mysql.override

command from root shell
echo manual &gt;&gt; /etc/init/mysql.override


And, hopefully real soon, you will be able to create an ""override"" file to disable a service without editing the job definition at all, by just putting the 'manual' keyword in it.

Here is a screenshot of the exact message:


This happened on both my Lubuntu machine and Kubuntu machine, and it wasn't a problem until after I upgraded; so I suspect that it was not user error.

How can I fix this?

UPDATE

I have tracked this down to my .bashrc file, which is getting called by my .profile file.  Though, the fact that my .bashrc file now runs when I do a GUI login whereas it didn't before I upgraded is a bit weird.  And no, I haven't modified my .bashrc file or my .profile recently.  Also, bash isn't my default shell.

The problem is that I am calling tput in my .bashrc file to set up variables for use in adding color to the prompt.  But at the (inappropriate) time when my .bashrc file now gets run, $TERM is not set.

One solution I tried was to check whether $TERM was set. But this didn't seem to work; I still got the same error message.  Here's the code:

3054,3054,4864,Is there an algorithm to generate digitally signed URL links?,"Scenario:


Alice prepares an URL link to Bob's web service (e.g., http://www.bob.com/sensitiveData/123?login=mallory).
Alice gives the URL link to Mallory.
Mallory follows the link to trigger an action in Bob's system.


Alice's link is intended for Mallory. Note that Mallory is authenticated by Alice but not by Bob. Bob does not know Mallory, but he trusts Alice. So if Alice has authorized Mallory to perform the action, Bob will blindly execute it.

The problem: How can Bob be sure that it is really Alice's link and that Mallory has not modified it in step 2?

In theory, such problems can be solved by a digital signature with a public-key algorithm. Alice could generate a signature of the link with her private key and append it to the URL, for example, http://www.bob.com/sensitiveData/123?login=mallory&amp;signiture=&lt;SOME-SIGNITURE&gt;).

How do you generate the signature? As an experiment, I just tried gpg --encrypt but the results are quite huge. Additionally, it has to be encoded to use it inside an URL (e.g., with Base64), which will make it even larger.

As I'm not very experienced with cryptographic algorithms and protocols, I wanted to ask whether there is an well-known solution to the problem of generating signed URLs?

If not, do you see any flaw in my approach? Do you have any recommendation for the generation of the signature that can be appended to the link? If possible, it should be relatively short.



Just for clarification: Unfortunately, it is not possible to change the overall protocol. Of course, it would be safer if Alice and Bob could directly communicate over an encrypted connection. Additionally, Mallory should have to ask Alice to tell Bob to trigger the action, or Bob should have the option to ask Alice to authorize the action.
",Philipp Claßen,https://security.stackexchange.com/users/18241,"A RSA signature has the length of the modulus: if using the usual 2048-bit key size, then signatures are 256-byte long. Since you want to fit the signature within a URL, which is text-based, you must have some sort of encoding such as Base64, which implies some size overhead; with Base64, 256 bytes will become 342 characters -- that makes for URL of quite respectable length.

DSA (and its highly fashionable elliptic-curve variant ECDSA) offers smaller signatures; you can get very decent security (as much as 2048-bit RSA) with signatures of size 60 bytes or so -- there again, Base64 encoding inflates that to 80 characters.

If you need even smaller signatures, then you must go to less mainstream algorithms, e.g. BLS, which offers signatures twice smaller than DSA. But the maths are fiendishly more complex, and there is no standard, only scientific papers.

Alternatively, you may want to use RSA with ISO 9796-2 signatures (not PKCS#1). You will get 256-byte signatures, but you may then smuggle some of your application data within the signature itself. As a rough approximation, you will get your n-bit security with a total overhead of about 3n bits; albeit with a minimal message size of 256 bytes.

Theoretical limit: if you want a security level of n bits (meaning that attackers are assumed not to be able to run computations which need more than 2n elementary operations), then the signature size cannot be less than n bits either. Indeed, an attacker could try brute force on the signature, trying out all possible signature values and using the signature verification algorithm (which uses Alice's public key, which is public, hence known to the attacker) until a matching signature is found.

However, there is no currently known secure digital signature algorithm which offers n-bit security with n-bit signatures. DSA needs to use 4n-bit signatures to offer n-bit security. BLS lowers that to 2n bits. There have been proposals for some other algorithm types which could reach down to 1.5n bits or so, but right now they all turned out to be flawed in some way.



It may be possible that you could change your model slightly. For instance, Alice and Bob may share some secret value; Bob then does not really trust ""Alice"" but rather ""whoever knows the secret value, which happens to be known to both Alice and Bob"". In that case, you can rely on a MAC algorithm instead of a digital signature; you can think of MAC algorithms as signatures where the key to sign and the key to verify are the same.

It is a change of context. Depending on who Alice and Bob are in your system, sharing a secret may or may not be possible. Using a MAC forfeits most chances at non-repudiation. It also means that Bob can himself produce URL that he will accept. Yet, if you can tolerate the use of a MAC, then you can get very short verification elements. In fact, you can even get below n bits because exhaustive search can no longer be applied: since the MAC verification key is secret, the attacker cannot try MAC values and decide whether they are correct on his own machines. To ""try"" a potential MAC value, the attacker MUST then send it to Bob, and see if Bob is happy with it or not. After a million tries or so, Bob may begin to suspect foul play and apply countermeasures (e.g. cease to respond to that decidedly dodgy requester).

In that sense, a MAC value of length 64 bits ought to be sufficient. That's just 8 bytes -- encodable with Base64 as 11 characters. HMAC is a widely implemented MAC algorithm with good repute.



There is no well-established standard for ""signed URL"". Every site designer works out his own scheme, which is unfortunate because homemade cryptography is one of the surest paths to disaster. The conceptual model, though, is sound: basically, you want Mallory to convey a message from Alice to Bob, such that Bob can know that the message really comes from Alice, and was not altered or even invented altogether by Mallory. That the message travels as a ""URL"" is a mere encoding constraint which has no impact on the concept.

A MAC or a signature is indeed the right tool here. Beware, though, of replay attacks: if Mallory has an Alice-signed URL that Bob will accept, Mallory may try to send that URL twice to Bob, to get twice the effect. Depending on your context, this may or may not be a problem. If it is, then Bob MUST enforce some protection mechanism, e.g. remembering past requests to reject duplicates. A time stamp within the URL data (under cover of the MAC or signature) can help Bob keep track of seen URL (i.e. Bob can forget ""expired"" URL since he won't accept them any more).

2576,2576,4100,"How to prevent the ""Too awesome to use"" syndrome","When you give the player a rare but powerful item which can only be used once but is never really required to proceed, most players will not use it at all, because they are waiting for the perfect moment. But even when this moment comes, they will still be reluctant to use it, because there might be an even better moment later. So they keep hoarding it for a moment which will never come. 

In the end, they will carry the item around until it is outclassed by other, more readily available resources, or even until the very end of the game. That means that such one-shot items don't provide any gameplay-value at all. They are simply too awesome to use.

What can you do to encourage the player to make use of their one-shot items and not hoard them?

Have something more valuable than the item that the player can lose if they hesitate to use the item. EG You might use your single-use invincibility potion to save you from death in a game where death is permanent.

Long Answer:

I think the only games in which such an item can work are ones where there is some form of persistent punishment for failure: Things like permadeath, loss of money/exp/stats on death, limited lives before having to restart the game (that's pretty outdated, but whatever). So when the player gets stuck or comes up against a challenge that they are likely to fail, they have an incentive to skip part or all of this challenge using the super item.

You could look at a lot of old arcade shooters, where you where often given about 3 bombs to use per life and could not recover any more. Bombs where valuable, but not as valuable as lives. Players would never use them unless it was necessary, but they wouldn't hesitate if they thought it would prevent them from dying. The same principle can be applied to single-use items, as long as there is something more valuable that the use of such an item can protect.

In a lot of games, failure is not really penalized and therefore there is no reason to use rare resources. There is no reason to use limited resources to prevent the loss of a life when you have infinite lives. I suppose you could add a particular encounter to the game that forces the items use (like the Master Ball in pokemon), but that can fall into guide dang it territory. 

Making the game more difficult is not a solution, as players will not have the item for the vast majority of their playtime. ""If this is hard now, I should save the super-weapon for when it's even worse!""

EDIT: As zzzzBov points out below, you could also make the item itself disappear upon death. Which would certainly make players more likely to use it.

2590,2590,4120,Why does string theory have such a huge landscape?,"I was browsing through Foundations of Space and Time, a compilation of essays on various theories of quantum gravity. The following passage in the introduction intrigued me:


  Each compactification leads to a different vacuum state.... at least one state should describe our Universe in its entirety.... the enormous number (~10^500 at last count) of solutions, with no perturbative mechanism to select mechanism to select among them, leads some critics to question the predictive power of the theory..Even more worrying is that, while the theory is perturbatively finite order by order, the perturbation series does not seem to converge.


I don't know anything about string theory and so I could not make head or tails this. All I know is that ~$10^{500}$    is a very large number. 


What exactly is a 'solution' in string theory? Is it a spacetime metric of some sort or the terms of a S-matrix of some sort?  
Why are there so many 'solutions'? 
I thought string theory was supposed to be finite, why do perturbative series still diverge?
Is there any experimental technique to limit the number of 'solutions'?  
Will experimental techniques be able to pinpoint a solution within present day string theorists' lifetimes too? If not, how long will it take before we can experimentally probe these things? 
Are string theorists completely relaxed about these issues? Or are they in anguish? 

",dj_mummy,https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/28244,"Who wrote that passage? It contains some misunderstandings.


  All I know is that $10^{500}$ is a very large number. 


It is a finite number. How many theories do you know which have a finite number of solutions? Have you tried to count the number of solutions of plain Einstein-Yang-Mills-Dirac-Higgs theory without its string-theoretic UV completion? There are not only infinitely-many solutions, there is a hugely infinite-dimensional space of solutions. This is the usual state of affairs for most every theory of physics ever considered. String theory is special in that it puts many more constraints on the solutions, such as to even leave just a finite number (under some assumptions).


  What exactly is a 'solution' in string theory? 


A background for perturbative string theory is a choice of 2-dimensional superconformal QFT of central charge -15. This can be interpreted as describing an effective target space geometry which is a solution to a higher dimensional supergravity theory with higher curvature corrections. A ""solution"" to string theory is a solution of the equations of motion of that. At least without non-perturbative effects taken into account. 

See on the nLab: landscape of string theory vacua for more.


  I thought string theory was supposed to be finite, why do perturbative series still diverge?


String theory is thought to be loop-wise finite, thus being a renormalized perturbative theory. No sensible remormalized perturbative QFT can have converging perturbation series. The perturbation series must be an asymptotic series to be realistic, and it comes out exactly like this in string perturbation theory. 

See at the String Theory FAQ on the nLab the item Isn’t it fatal that the string perturbation series does not converge?


  Is there any experimental technique to limit the number of 'solutions'? Will experimental techniques be able to pinpoint a solution within present day string theorists' lifetimes too?

2632,2632,4185,KL divergence between two univariate Gaussians,"I need to determine the KL-divergence between two Gaussians. I am comparing my results to these, but I can't reproduce their result. My result is obviously wrong, because the KL is not 0 for KL(p, p).

I wonder where I am doing a mistake and ask if anyone can spot it.

Let $p(x) = N(\mu_1, \sigma_1)$ and $q(x) = N(\mu_2, \sigma_2)$. From Bishop's
PRML I know that

$$KL(p, q) = - \int p(x) \log q(x) dx + \int p(x) \log p(x) dx$$

where integration is done over all real line, and that

$$\int p(x) \log p(x) dx = \frac{1}{2} (1 + \log 2 \pi \sigma_1^2),$$

so I restrict myself to $\int p(x) \log q(x) dx$, which I can write out as

$$-\int p(x) \log \frac{1}{(2 \pi \sigma_2^2)^{(1/2)}} e^{-\frac{(x-\mu_2)^2}{2 \sigma_2^2}} dx,$$

which I can separate into

$$\frac{1}{2} \log (2 \pi \sigma_2^2) - \int p(x) \log e^{-\frac{(x-\mu_2)^2}{2 \sigma_2^2}} dx.$$

Taking the log I get

$$\frac{1}{2} \log (2 \pi \sigma_2^2) - \int p(x) -\frac{(x-\mu_2)^2}{2 \sigma_2^2} dx,$$

where I separate the sums and get $\sigma_2^2$ out of the integral.

$$\frac{1}{2} \log (2 \pi \sigma_2^2) + \frac{\int p(x) x^2 dx - \int p(x) 2x\mu dx + \int p(x) \mu^2 dx}{2 \sigma_2^2}$$

Letting $\langle \rangle$ denote the expectation operator under $p$, I can rewrite this as

$$\frac{1}{2} \log (2 \pi \sigma_2^2) + \frac{\langle x^2 \rangle - 2 \langle x \rangle \mu_2 + \mu_2^2}{2 \sigma_2^2}.$$

We know that $var(x) = \langle x^2 \rangle - \langle x \rangle ^2$. Thus 

$$\langle x^2 \rangle = \sigma_1^2 + \mu_1^2$$

and therefore

$$\frac{1}{2} \log (2 \pi \sigma^2) + \frac{\sigma_1^2 + \mu_1^2 - 2 \mu_1 \mu_2 + \mu_2^2}{2 \sigma_2^2},$$

which I can put as

$$\frac{1}{2} \log (2 \pi \sigma_2^2) + \frac{\sigma_1^2 + (\mu_1 - \mu_2)^2}{2 \sigma_2^2}.$$

Putting everything together, I get to 

\begin{align*}
KL(p, q) &amp;= - \int p(x) \log q(x) dx + \int p(x) \log p(x) dx\\
&amp;= \frac{1}{2} \log (2 \pi \sigma_2^2) + \frac{\sigma_1^2 + (\mu_1 - \mu_2)^2}{2 \sigma_2^2} - \frac{1}{2} (1 + \log 2 \pi \sigma_1^2)\\
&amp;= \log \frac{\sigma_2}{\sigma_1} + \frac{\sigma_1^2 + (\mu_1 - \mu_2)^2}{2 \sigma_2^2}.
\end{align*}
Which is wrong since it equals $1$ for two identical Gaussians.

Can anyone spot my error?

Update

Thanks to mpiktas for clearing things up. The correct answer is:

$KL(p, q) = \log \frac{\sigma_2}{\sigma_1} + \frac{\sigma_1^2 + (\mu_1 - \mu_2)^2}{2 \sigma_2^2} - \frac{1}{2}$

3087,3087,4917,does re-encrypting the same value with multiple keys reduce security,"I found myself wondering today, how much security is lost if you take a plaintext - assume that its content, including any metadata is unknown to an attacker, for example it may be random data - and encrypt it with multiple keys (not chained) and give all resulting ciphertexts to an attacker, how much higher is the probability of an attacker discovering the plaintext, vs only having a single ciphertext. 

An example:

Take plaintext $P_1$ and encrypt it with $K_1$, and send the resulting ciphertext $C_1$ to attacker $A_1$.

In addition: take the same plaintext $P_1$ and, and encrypt it with $K_1$, giving $C_1$. Then take $P_1$ and encrypt it with $K_2$ giving $C_2$, then $K_n$ giving $C_n$ and send all $n$ ciphertexts to attacker $A_2$.

How much more likely is attacker $A_2$ to discover the value of $P_1$, than $A_1$?

  Does re-encrypting the same value with multiple keys reduce security?


The answer is ""it depends""; there are some attack models and encryption methods where the security is reduced, there are other cases where there appears to be no security reduction.

Let us go through some models where we actually see a security reduction:

Plaintext guessing attack and deterministic encryption


In this attack model, the attacker has a guess to the plaintext $P_{guess}$ and wants to confirm whether $P_1 \stackrel{?}{=} P_{guess}$.  What he can do is guess random keys $K_{guess}$ and compute $E_{K_{guess}}(P_{guess})$ and he if that appears in one of the ciphertexts he's been given.  If he happens to guess a key $K_i$, then ciphertext $C_i$ will match, and he will get confirmation that his guess is likely to be correct - that's because we assume that the encryption is deterministic and so if the keys and the plaintext match, the ciphertext will as well.  Obviously, using more keys means that there are more targets the attacker can stumble into.

Deterministic stream ciphers, and plaintext with known linear relations.


Here, we assume we don't know the plaintext, however we do know certain linear relations between the bits of the plaintext; for example, we may know that the parity of each byte is even.  We also assume that the cipher works by generating a keystream (as a function of the key), and then exclusive-or the keystream with the plaintext to form the ciphertext.

So, what the attacker can do is examine each ciphertext; by assuming that the linear relationships hold in the original plaintext, he can evaluate the corresponding linear functions on the keystream; in the example, he can compute the parity of each byte of the keystream.

Then, he can pick random keys, and generate the corresponding keystream (here, we assume that this is determanistic).  Then, he can compute the linear function of that keystream (in the example, the parity of each byte), and see if it matches one of the keystreams that correspond to the known ciphertexts.

Like the first example, having more targets makes it more likely that the attacker will guess the correct key.

(Also, if you think that the example of ""parity of each byte is even"" is contrived, a more realistic example is ""the msbit of each byte is 0"").

Deterministic RSA encryption


If the encrypt the exact same message (without padding, or using determanistic padding) to $n$ different keys, and $n \ge e$ (where $e$ is the common public exponent), then it's easy to recover the message.  This is typically used as an example why you need to add randomness to your RSA encryption, even if you don't care about plaintext guessing attacks.



The above are three examples where encrypting with multiple keys can reduce security; in other cases (such as CBC-mode encryption), there is no obvious way to use multiple ciphertexts.

Now, the obvious thing about all three examples are that they are deterministic encryption; it would appear to be wise to add randomness if you are encrypting with multiple keys.

Meaning that what you are doing, essentially, is this:

Do heavier objects fall faster?

Don&#39;t heavier objects actually fall faster because they exert their own gravity?

I was going to ask: if mass is an objects tendency to resist acceleration then why do two objects of different masses fall to the Earth at the same acceleration?

Then I read those posts and it seems that even though it is very small, the more massive object falls faster. Okay I understand, both objects attract each other.

If two cars of different masses collide doesn't the car with less mass accelerate more even though both cars received the same Force. Then that implies you need more force to accelerate a large mass than to accelerate a small mass. Because that is how I see it, the Moon attracts the Earth with the same Force as the Earth attracts the Moon but the Earth accelerates less due to its larger mass.

So then how is mass an object's tendency to resist acceleration? I am aware of $F_1 = F_2 = GMm/r^2$. So should we not really be able to see the difference in acceleration when dropping a massive object?
",CharlieK,https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/43959,"
  Mass is an object's tendency to resist acceleration.


This applies when both masses you're testing are subjected to identical forces. 

From Newton's Law of Gravity,

$$F = G \frac{M \cdot m}{r^2}$$

It is fairly obvious that the force the Earth exerts on a heavy body is more that what it exerts on a light body, so you can not compare the accelerations by comparing just the masses in this case.

Newton's second law gives $$a = \frac{F}{m} = G \frac{M}{r^2}$$

For two bodies an equal distance away from the Earth's center of mass, you can see that the acceleration for both bodies is indeed, the same and independent of the body mass.

Of course, this assumes there is no drag on the falling body, and that the only appreciable force is that due to Newton's Law.

To summarize: 

There is no difference in the acceleration of two objects of identical shape but different masses. The difference you observe between a feather and a golf ball, for example, is not because of gravity - it's because of the shape and the air resistance the body encounters.

Clarification This answer assumes you're in an inertial reference frame (attached to the center of mass of the falling object and the Earth), and that ""falling"" means the motion of the object towards this center of mass. 

If you consider falling to mean the motion of the object relative to the Earth, then, because the force exerted on the Earth by a heavier body is more, the Earth will accelerate towards the center of mass ever so slightly, and therefore the object will fall ever so slightly faster.

726,726,1156,How to determine directions of vectors of an electromagnetic wave,"I did an exercise which probably is quite popular,
in which you draw an electromagnetic wave and prove that it should
propagate at the speed of light $1 \over \sqrt {\mu_0\epsilon_0}$ using Farday's law and Ampere's law.

Basically if this is the wave: 




Let's say the E-field (red) is in the X direction, the B-Field (blue) is in the Y direction,
and the velocity of the wave is in the Z direction.

You take for example for ampere's law a surface in the ZY plane with a length L
equal to the amplitude of the wave,
and a width equal to $\lambda\over 4$
You do a similar thing with Faraday's law and you get the speed of light,
assuming you know that the E-field and B-field propagate in this manner.

I got the right answer but I wondered about this:
Let's say I only had the E-field and I know the wave propagates at the speed of light, I assume this is enough information to draw the B-field at each point.

But how will I know the direction? Both Faraday's law and Ampere's law say you need a closed loop integral and the rules I've been taught say
you go over the loop in a clockwise direction for example and take the 
normal to the surface according to the right hand rule etc.

But clockwise and counter-clockwise direction don't really give me much information in this case, so how can I determine the direction of the B-field
if I only have the E-field?

",Gerard,https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/139,"Well, I don't know about any intuitive explanation besides intuition gained by understanding the underlying math (mainly differential geometry, Hamiltonian mechanics and group theory). So with the risk of not giving you quite what you want, I'll try to approach the problem mathematically.

If you know Hamiltonian mechanics then the statement of the theorem is exceedingly simple. Assume we have a Hamiltonian $H$. To this there is associated a unique Hamiltonian flow (i.e. a one-parameter family of symplectomorphisms -- which is just a fancy name for diffeomorphisms preserving the symplectic structure) $\Phi_H(t)$ on the manifold. From the point of view of Lie theory, the flow is a group action and there exists its generator (which is a vector field) $V_H$ (this can also be obtained from $\omega(\cdot, V_H) = dH$ with $\omega$ being the symplectic form). Now, the completely same stuff can be written for some other function $A$, with generator $V_A$ and flow $\Phi_A(s)$. Think of this $A$ as some conserved quantity and of $\Phi_A(s)$ as a continuous family of symmetries.

Now, starting from Hamiltonian equation ${{\rm d} A \over {\rm d} t} = \left\{A,H\right\}$ we see that if $A$ Poisson-commutes with $H$ it is conserved. Now, this is not the end of the story. From the second paragraph it should be clear that $A$ and $H$ don't differ that much. Actually, what if we swapped them? Then we'd get ${{\rm d} H \over {\rm d} s} = \left\{H,A\right\}$. So we see that $A$ is constant along Hamiltonian flow (i.e. conserved) if and only if $H$ is constant along the symmetry flow (i.e. the physical laws are symmetric).

So much for why the stuff works. Now, how do we get from symmetries to conserved quantities? This actually isn't hard at all but requires some knowledge of differential geometry. Let's start with most simple example.

Translation

This is a symmetry such that $x \to x^\prime = x + a$. You can imagine that we move our coordinates along the $x$ direction. With $a$ being a parameter, this is a symmetry flow. If we differentiate with respect to this parameter, we'll get a vector field. Here it'll be $\partial_x$ (i.e. constant vector field aiming in the direction $x$). Now, what function on the symplectic manifold does it correspond to? Easy, it must be $p$ because by differentiating this we'll get a constant 1-form field $dp$ and then we have to use $\omega$ to get a vector field $\partial_x$.

Other way to see that it must be $p$: suppose you have a wave $\exp(ipx)$. Then $\partial_x \exp(ipx) = ip \exp(ipx)$ so momentum and partial derivatives are morally the same thing. Here we're of course exploiting the similarity between Fourier transform (which connects $x$ and $p$ images) and symplectic structure (which combines $x$ and $p$).

Rotation

Now onto something a bit harder. Suppose we have a flow 
$$\pmatrix{x \cr y} \to \pmatrix{x' \cr y'}=  \pmatrix{\cos(\phi) &amp; \sin(\phi) \cr - \sin(\phi) &amp; \cos(\phi)} \pmatrix {x \cr y} $$
 This is of course a rotational flow. Here we'll get a field $y {\rm d}x - x {\rm d} y$ and the conserved quantity of the form $y p_x - x p_y$ which can in three dimensions be thought of as a third component of angular momentum $L_z$.

Note that the above was done mainly for illustrative purposes as we could have worked in polar coordinates and then it would be actually the same problem as the first one because we'd get the field $\partial_{\phi}$ and conserved quantity $p_{\phi}$ (which is angular momentum).

The x-axes is showing wrong values, as you can see from the picture above. 

But console.log(chart_data.x_axes) gives 
[""Day 1"", ""Day 2"", ""Day 3""] which should be the correct x-axes label.

Please let me know how can i fix this x-axes label error.

Using ssh-agent alone means that a new instance of ssh-agent needs to be created for every new terminal you open. keychain when initialized will ask for the passphrase for the private key(s) and store it. That way your private key is password protected but you won't have to enter your password over and over again.

I want to measure the room as accurately as possible, because I want to create a plan for a friend who is a carpenter to cut some plates for a subceiling, and I would like for them to fit.

My current plan is to measure the diagonals shown in the sketch as well as all the individual wall-segments. This should give me the information to construct an accurate plan without actually having to measure the angles of the corners. 

The measuring is complicated by the fact that I cannot measure on the ground, because there is furniture in the way that I cannot move. Also, since the walls are really crooked, I want to take the measurements at the hight at which the subceiling will be built. The longest diagonal is about 6 meters.

How do I measure this room accurately? Is my approach sound? How can I measure these diagonals accurately (preferably without having to buy a laser-measuring-device)?

6031,6031,9572,Does reach let you threaten an opponent if there is another opponent between you?,"Okay, the following situation came up in a recent game of Pathfinder. Pretend the following are in a straight line, in a standard 5' grid with their bases touching each other.

player's summoned creature with 10' reach -> enemy minion-> enemy boss -> player

The only creature with extra reach in this scenario is the summoned creature. Does it threaten the enemy boss (who is 10' away) and provide flanking for the player?

The rules state ""You threaten all squares into which you can make a melee attack"", which led my group to think it did indeed threaten the enemy boss. However, we're unclear on if the enemy minion between the boss and summoned creature provides cover, and if so, how that might impact threatened squares.
",Sterno,https://rpg.stackexchange.com/users/213,"You would flank, but cannot make Attacks of Opportunity*

Threatening


  Threatened Squares: You threaten all squares into which you can make a
  melee attack, even when it is not your turn. Generally, that means
  everything in all squares adjacent to your space (including
  diagonally). An enemy that takes certain actions while in a threatened
  square provokes an attack of opportunity from you. If you're unarmed,
  you don't normally threaten any squares and thus can't make attacks of
  opportunity.


AoO Rule:


  Cover and Attacks of Opportunity: You can't execute an attack of
  opportunity against an opponent with cover relative to you.


Soft Cover Rule:


  Soft Cover: Creatures, even your enemies, can provide you with cover
  against ranged attacks, giving you a +4 bonus to AC. However, such
  soft cover provides no bonus on Reflex saves, nor does soft cover
  allow you to make a Stealth check.


Those both come from the PRD section on Combat

As @Jim Kiley notes, there is no rule that states cover negates threatening. Just that it negates taking AoOs.

So, yes, the creature would provide a flanking bonus, but would be unable to make attacks of opportunity.

*This is muddied a bit by the fact that ""Threatened Squares"" are only described under attacks of opportunity, and it is a bit unclear if ""threaten"" == ""can make an AoO"". RAW, they're not technically the same thing, and thus my interpretation.

Edit: Turns out Creatures are only cover against ranged attacks, (double edit) but you determine cover as if with range if the target is not adjacent.


  When making a melee attack against a target that isn't adjacent to you
  (such as with a reach weapon), use the rules for determining cover
  from ranged attacks.


BUT

If the creature is large or larger, it gets to do this (which means if it's hampered by a medium creature it could probably finagle itself outside of cover):


  Big Creatures and Cover: Any creature with a space larger than 5 feet
  (1 square) determines cover against melee attacks slightly differently
  than smaller creatures do. Such a creature can choose any square that
  it occupies to determine if an opponent has cover against its melee
  attacks. Similarly, when making a melee attack against such a
  creature, you can pick any of the squares it occupies to determine if
  it has cover against you.

However when you have TLS on neither, you should let users authenticate through third parties, e.g. through OpenID. Then you don't need to handle sensitive data like passwords. OpenID is a good option for the other cases too.

",Searcher,https://academia.stackexchange.com/users/35322,"If I'm understanding correctly, the problem you're concerned about is what to do when you've just submitted a paper, and now you have a long wait before you can submit the follow-up paper.  Your question then presumes that a good solution to this problem is to try to accelerate the publication process.

I think that is a bad assumption.  There is no reason that you need to be stalled on your forward progress just because a paper is under review.  Here are two good alternatives that work within the system.


You can continue directly building on the same direction.  If you get to a major milestone and are ready to submit a new paper before the previous one is finished reviewing, you can submit a paper citing the one under review as ""submitted,"" and include the draft paper as supplementary review-only information.
Research typically has a lot of ""branching path"" options getting catalogued in your ""future work"" sections.  Why not take a secondary path that you've wanted to investigate but isn't in the same exactly line of progression as the paper currently under review?  That will likely lead to its own interesting results that can be published without dependency on the paper currently under review.


It also seems possible to me that this concern may have arisen due to trying to publish too incrementally.  If you cluster your work into larger ""publication units"" the time lag will likely be less problematic and a smaller number of significant papers is generally better for your career than a bunch of little incremental papers that nobody cares about.

5795,5795,9181,Network database access - How do I connect to a remote database?,"I am able to connect to a specific MS Access Database when it is on the same Windows computer as Mathematica via the command

&lt;&lt; DatabaseLink`;
conn = OpenSQLConnection[JDBC[""odbc"", ""Databasename""]];


However, I cannot figure out how to connect to this database over a local area network -- disregarding trivial network problems (the computers can ping eachother), is this even possible?
",R.S.,https://mathematica.stackexchange.com/users/6704,"This is not really an answer yet, but definitely too long for a comment. 

Access databases are designed for single user access and store data, forms and code in a single file. It is possible to access such a file from a remote computer via e.g. a network drive. As there is no real database server involved, concurrent usage of the same database file with several processes/programs will only be possible within certain limits (which I don't know about).

It should be possible to access such a file from a network drive via the usual ODBC drivers, but you might need to configure those accordingly. You have mentioned that you want to access the database from a linux client: There are OBDC drivers for access databasefiles which work under linux, but I don't know if and how it is possible to use those from Mathematica, but would expect that should be possible. If the file lives on a windows server you could mount a network file with the samba client programs, but that might introduce additional restrictions on concurrent usage as there could be differences in how the file locking and other details are handled. I would be very careful when experimenting with such a setup. On the other hand I wouldn't expect insurmountable problems if only one program accesses the database file at a time.

Depending on how you are using that database converting the database is probably the best you can do, especially if you need concurrent access. As a first try you could try to use e.g. openoffice or kexi to convert the database, but of course you could also do that with Mathematica on a Windows machine. Depending on the target format there might be even better options, e.g. specialized import functions/scripts for certain database systems.

If you don't need concurrent access you could consider SQLite as a target format which like Access stores the data in plain files and also is ""serverless"", so using it might be simpler than setting up a database server.

Access databases are designed for single user access and store data, forms and code in a single file. It is possible to access such a file from a remote computer via e.g. a network drive. As there is no real database server involved, concurrent usage of the same database file with several processes/programs will only be possible within certain limits (which I don't know about).

It should be possible to access such a file from a network drive via the usual ODBC drivers, but you might need to configure those accordingly. You have mentioned that you want to access the database from a linux client: There are OBDC drivers for access databasefiles which work under linux, but I don't know if and how it is possible to use those from Mathematica, but would expect that should be possible. If the file lives on a windows server you could mount a network file with the samba client programs, but that might introduce additional restrictions on concurrent usage as there could be differences in how the file locking and other details are handled. I would be very careful when experimenting with such a setup. On the other hand I wouldn't expect insurmountable problems if only one program accesses the database file at a time.

Depending on how you are using that database converting the database is probably the best you can do, especially if you need concurrent access. As a first try you could try to use e.g. openoffice or kexi to convert the database, but of course you could also do that with Mathematica on a Windows machine. Depending on the target format there might be even better options, e.g. specialized import functions/scripts for certain database systems.

If you don't need concurrent access you could consider SQLite as a target format which like Access stores the data in plain files and also is ""serverless"", so using it might be simpler than setting up a database server. There is a JDBC driver for SQLite, which you should be able to use from Mathematica. There is also an undocumented more direct implementation to access a SQLite database from within Mathematica even without DatabaseLink, which you should find some notes about in the web.

2001,2001,3195,Examples of two different descriptions of a set that are not obviously equivalent?,"I am teaching a course in enumerative combinatorics this semester and one of my students asked for deeper clarification regarding the difference between a ""combinatorial"" and a ""bijective"" proof.  Specifically, they pointed out that when one is proving the validity of a combinatorial identity by counting a set in two different ways, this is a different activity than giving an explicit bijection between two different sets.  However, in combinatorics we often use the phrases ""combinatorial proof"" and ""bijective proof"" as synonyms, and I have often heard people use the phrase ""bijective proof"" regarding a ""count in two different ways"" proof of an identity.

It seems to me that often a combinatorial proof arises from describing one set in two different ways; implicit in a proof of the equality of the two descriptions of this set is the identity bijection from the set to itself.  In this sense, one might regard all ""combinatorial"" proofs as ""bijective,"" but I feel that I am on quite shaky ground with this.  These thoughts have led me to the following questions:

Question 1: What are some examples of combinatorial situations where the same set can be described in two different ways but it is not at all clear that the two descriptions yield the same object?

Question 2: What are some examples of situations where two bijective proofs have been given for a theorem or identity where the bijections turned out to be the same, but proving their equivalence was non-trivial?

I would also appreciate opinions regarding the distinction, if any, between combinatorial arguments where one proves identities by describing a set in two different ways and combinatorial arguments where one sets up bijections between genuinely different sets of objects.

EDIT

Thanks for the answers and comments so far.  Here are two examples that will hopefully clarify what I am asking.  One example of a bijective proof between two different sets are showing that Dyck paths and nonnesting partitions are both Catalan-enumerated objects (even preserving the Narayana statistic with a good bijection).  On the other hand, the identity $\sum_{k=0}^nk{n\choose k}=n2^{n-1}$ is usually proved by describing $k$-subsets of $n$ with a distinguished element in two different ways: in the first way, pick the set then specify the element; in the second way, pick the element then specify the rest of the set.  These are both referred to as bijective or combinatorial proofs, yet somehow they each have a different feel to them.  In the second case, it is pretty easy to see that the two descriptions of these objects yield the same set of objects, but surely there must be more situations where the same set is described in two different ways and the equivalence of their descriptions is difficult to ascertain.  Similarly, there must be times where there are several bijections between different sets, like the first example, where the bijections are the same but not obviously so.  What I am wondering about are examples of these two situations.

A non-combinatorial example of an answer to Q1 is the compact-group vs reflection group definition of the Weyl group of a semi-simple Lie Algebra, where it isn't immediately clear that the same group is obtained.  However, I am looking for more combinatorial examples.

3527,3527,5624,How do I make certain areas editable?,"I'm new to wordpress and I'm currently converting an HTML/CSS site I made to wordpress to make it easier for my client to edit it from the admin panel.

I have provided 3 screenshots and I'll refer to them here.

The first screenshot shows how my website looks so far. It's using a template I made called homepage.php (see screenshot 3 for code). The template includes header.php which contains the logo, navigation menu etc. It has the image banner and finally includes footer.php. I want the ""Our Values"" part to be editable so that my client can change the text any time they need to. 

Currently, they can edit the top part which says ""PROtential Coaching"" and that's because it's included on the page within the admin panel and not in the template. I want the bottom part including""Our Values"" to be editable from that panel too, is there a way to do this or does this content have to be static and within the template? ""Our Values"" and ""Our People"" are in a dynamic secondary navigation menu which my client can add items to if they want to, however they can't change the content for the menu item.

2891,2891,4600,What is the difference between drought resistant non-succulent plants and plants that cannot be allowed to dry out?,"What features make one plant able to withstand dry spells better than another with relatively similar structure? For instance, one of my Rudbeckias is wilting from drought at the moment, and an Oenothera next to it is not yet showing signs of dryness.

Or like jewelweed (Impatiens capensis), which wilts even while the soil is damp, in full sun, and ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia), which will grow in very dry locations without being phased.

Is it caused by a faster transpiration rate in some plants than in others?
",J. Musser,https://biology.stackexchange.com/users/338,"The difference may be related to how the plants fix carbon. While all plants convert CO₂ and H₂O to glucose and oxygen, there are at least three pathways that are used to do it. The C3 pathway is older and less efficient than the CAM and C4 pathways. Many drought tolerant plants use the CAM or C4 pathways because less water is needed. The C4 pathway is better than C3 in drier climates, hotter climates, and when CO₂ or nitrogen are limited. The hard part about this answer is that I'm not a botanist. Wikipedia lists some plants that use C4, CAM, and C3, but there is no comprehensive list, so I can't match up all the plants you mentioned in your question. In general, a higher percentage of monocots, especially grasses, use C4, but a wider diversity of dicots use C4. But you still can't draw conclusions about families of plants, because while corn and sorghum use C4, rice and barley use C3. Ragweed, a plant you say grows well in dry conditions, is a member of Asteraceae, which includes many plants that use C4. However, rudbeckias are also members of Asteraceae, but don't do as well in dry conditions.

4004,4004,6394,Why do marshmallows poof up so huge when put in the microwave?,"As anyone who's put marshmallows in the microwave knows, they expand a ton! Sometimes they puff up to literally more than twice their original size (YouTube video for those who haven't seen it).

So, why?
At first I assumed it was because they had a lot of air in them, but that doesn't make sense. There's no way that amount of air can puff up that much from the heat!

What makes marshmallows poof up so much when they are microwaved?
",Nathan G.,https://cooking.stackexchange.com/users/6549,"Marshmallows expand so much because the water in them becomes steam, and gas takes up a LOT more volume than liquid. Specifically, 1 mL of water becomes ~1.36 LITERS of vapor, before it gets heated further.  That's 1000-fold expansion, before you add additional expansion as the gas is heated.  

Marshmallows don't have all that much water content, but when it's trapped in a stretchy gelatin matrix that holds gas readily, it only takes a bit to blow the whole thing up like a balloon.

You are correct that the gas expansion on its own is insufficient; unless I've badly muddled my calculations, gas expansion from 20C to ~150C (caramelization temperature) will increase the gas volume by under 50%.

4649,4649,7372,"Can a smaller sensor's ""crop factor"" be used to calculate the exact increase in depth of field?","If APS-C and similar crop-sensor digital cameras have a focal length multiplying effect such that a 50mm lens has an apparent focal length closer to the field of view of an 80mm on a full frame camera, and yet at the same time the depth of field for the smaller sensor camera is more like the depth of field a 50mm lens would produce on a full frame camera (using the same aperture), then this would seem to suggest the concept of an ""aperture dividing effect.""

In other words, a 50mm f/1.8 lens on an APS-C camera would act more like a 80mm f/2.8 (approx. 1.8 * 1.6x) lens in 35mm equivalent — for depth of field, not considering exposure.

Can someone with a better understanding of the physics involved clarify this for me.  I've never seen this concept explicitly mentioned anywhere, so I am a bit suspect of it.
",Sean,https://photo.stackexchange.com/users/1480,"Yes, a sensor's crop factor can be used when calculating the change in depth of field (DoF) of a lens compared to that lens' use on a full frame (FF) camera. But it will not always lead to an increase in the DoF. If shot from the same distance and displayed to the same size, the DoF for the crop body camera will be reduced (because the virtual image projected on the sensor, including the circles of confusion, will be enlarged to a greater degree). If, on the other hand, you adjust your shooting distance to frame the subject similarly the DoF will increase.

There are so many variables to deal with in this question and most of the answers assume several without specifying those assumptions. This leads to gross misunderstandings about the relationship of focal length, aperture, sensor size, shooting distance, display size, viewing distance, and even the visual acuity of the viewer to Depth of Field (DoF). All of these factors combined will determine the Depth of Field of an image. This is because DoF is a perception of what range of distances from the focal plane are in focus. Only one distance from the focal plane is actually in focus such that a point light source will theoretically produce a point of light on the focal plane. Point light sources at all other distances produce a blur circle that varies in size based on their proportional distance to the focal plane as compared to the focus distance. DoF is defined as the range between the near and far distance from the focal plane that the blur circle is still perceived as a point by the viewer of an image.

We ask questions such as, ""How does depth of field change when using the same lens on a camera with a different sized sensor?"" The correct answer is, ""It depends."" It depends on whether you shoot from the same distance (and thus change the framing of the subject) or shoot from a difference distance to approximate the same framing of the subject. It depends on whether the display size of the image is the same or the display size of the image is changed by the same proportion as the different sensor sizes. It depends on what changes and what stays the same in regard to all of the factors cited above.

If the same focal length is used at the same subject distance with the same aperture using the same sensor size with the same pixel density and printed at the same resolution on the same size paper and viewed by persons with the same visual acuity then the DoF of the two images will be the same. If any one of these variables change without a corresponding change to the others, the DoF will also be changed.

For the rest of this answer we will assume the image viewing distance and the visual acuity of the viewer are constant. We will also assume that apertures are large enough that diffraction does not come into play. And we will assume any printing is done on the same printer at the same number of dpi but not necessarily the same ppi and not necessarily on the same size paper.

For the sake of simplicity, let's consider a couple of theoretical cameras. One has a 36mm X 24mm sensor with a resolution of 3600 X 2400 pixels. This would be an 8.6MP full frame (FF) sensor. Our other camera has a 24mm X 16mm sensor with a resolution of 2400 X 1600 pixels. This would be a 3.8MP 1.5x crop body (CB). Both cameras have the same pixel size and pixel pitch. Both cameras have the same design and sensitivity at the pixel level. In other words the center 24mm X 16mm of the larger FF sensor is identical to the smaller CB sensor.

If you attach the same 50mm lens to both cameras and take a photo of the same subject from the same distance at f/2 (assuming all other settings are the same) and crop the FF sensor image to 2400 X 1600 pixels and print both images on 6"" X 4"" paper, the two images will be virtually identical, and the DoF will be the same in both photos.

If you attach the same 50mm lens to both cameras and take a photo of the same subject from the same distance at f/2 (assuming all other settings are the same) and print all of both images on 6"" X 4"" paper there will be some noticeable differences. The image from the FF camera will have a wider field of view (FoV), the subject will be smaller and the DoF will be greater than the image from the CB camera. This is because the FF image was printed at 600 ppi and the CB image was printed at 400 ppi. By enlarging each pixel from the CB camera by 50%, we also enlarged the size of each blur circle by the same amount. This means that the largest blur circle projected on the CB sensor that will be perceived as a point is 33% smaller (the reciprocal of 3/2 is 2/3) than on the FF sensor. If we had printed the FF image on 9"" X 6"" paper and the CB image on 6"" X 4"" paper the DoF would have been the same (both printed at 400 ppi), as would the subject sizes in both prints. If we then trimmed the center of the 9"" X 6"" print to a 6"" X 4"" print we would again have near identical prints.

If we attach the same 50mm lens to both cameras and take a photo at f/2 of the same subject from different distances so that the subject size is the same and print both images on 6"" X 4"" paper there will be some noticeable differences. The perspective will have changed because the CB image was taken at a greater distance from the subject. The subject will appear compressed in the CB image compared to the FF image. If background details are visible the background will also appear closer to the subject than in the image from the FF sensor. Because the 50mm lens was focused at a 50% greater distance, the DoF also increased by 50%. If the subject was at 10' using the FF camera and 15' using the CB camera here are the resulting DoF calculations:


50mm @ f/2 from 10' on FF: 9.33' to 10.8'. DoF of 1.45' (17.4""). The DoF ranges from 8"" in front of to 9.6"" behind the 10' point of focus (PoF).
50mm @ f/2 from 15' on CB: 14.0' to 16.2'. DoF of 2.18' (26.16""). The DoF ranges from 12"" in front of to 14.4"" behind the 15' PoF.


These calculations are based on a circle of confusion (CoC) of .03mm for the FF camera and .02mm for the CB camera. This is because we are printing at 600 ppi for the FF and 400 ppi for the CB (and the pixels are the same size for both- 0.01mm or 10µm).

In reality, we all know the pixels on most FF sensors are larger than the pixels on most newer CB sensors. They range from 6.92µm on the 18MP FF Canon 1D X to 7.21µm on the 16MP D4 to 4.7µm on the 36MP FF Nikon D800. The crop bodies go from 4.16µm for the 18MP Canon 7D to 3.89µm for the 24MP Nikon D7100 (the D7200 will be around 3.0µm) to 5.08µm for the 14MP Sony SLT Alpha 33. In all cases the pixel size is considerably smaller than the generally accepted CoC of .03mm (30µm) for FF cameras and .02mm (20µm) for 1.5x CB cameras. For 1.6x CB Canon cameras 0.019 (19µm) is generally used. The largest size pixels Canon has used in the last decade or so was 8.2µm for the 12.8MP FF 5D and the 8.2MP APS-H 1D mkII. What all this means is that at the pixel peeping level, focus blur will be visible even for objects within the accepted DoF because the accepted blur circle is anywhere from 4 to 7 times larger than the pixels on current DSLRs.  To calculate DoF at the pixel level you would need to use a CoC the size of your camera's pixels which would be much narrower than most DoF calculators use.

3170,3170,5047,Decoding Matrix Encoded Surround Sound Through Convolution,"I wish to create a finite impulse response filter to decode a dolby digital matrix encoded 2 channel signal into 5 channels. These filters would then be used in a realtime pipeline on a Linux machine using jack and jconvolver to do the convolution.

The equation is as follows:

 

The reference for the above equation is: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_decoder

It would seem this should be able to be done but I haven't the faintest how. Any help, and in particular working code that could generate the filters (Octave or other open source preferred) would be much appreciated!
",psandersen,https://dsp.stackexchange.com/users/3142,"Suppose that we had two channels encoded in some form in two signals according to a matrix.  Recovering the original signals would be straightforward using the matrix inverse (or impossible, if the inverse did not exist).  The situation is no different here, except that the matrix is not square, so you cannot use the conventional matrix inverse.  You can, however, use a pseudoinverse or generalized inverse to reconstruct the original signals.  

Other matrices which are not equal to an inverse may work also succeed, and may in fact sound better.  I don't know the psychoacoustic situation, but it may more sense to do some transform based on the position of speakers for example. Certainly, the inverse seems like a good place to start.

I rewrote your encoder table as a 2x5 input matrix $ E $, and used Wolfram Alpha to determine the inverse, $ D = E^{-1} $.  Here is the 5x2 result it provided, using $ i $ as the imaginary unit, with $ j = i $ and $ k = -i $.

$$
D = \frac{1}{18(46+6\sqrt{2})} \begin{bmatrix}
405 &amp; -3(27 - 36\sqrt{2}) \\
-3(27 - 36\sqrt{2}) &amp; 405 \\
6(18+27\sqrt{2}) &amp; 6(18+27\sqrt{2}) \\
-i(27\sqrt{3} + 99\sqrt{6}) &amp; i(63\sqrt{3} + 27\sqrt{6}) \\
-i(63\sqrt{3} + 27\sqrt{6}) &amp; i(27\sqrt{3} + 99\sqrt{6}) 
\end{bmatrix}
$$

As one would expect, the decoding matrix shows left/right symmetry.

Now we can express the encoding/decoding operations as:
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
L_{encoded} \\
R_{encoded}
\end{bmatrix} = E \space{} \begin{bmatrix}
L \\
R \\
C \\
L_{rear} \\
R_{rear} \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
L' \\
R' \\
C' \\
L_{rear}' \\
R_{rear}' \\
\end{bmatrix} = D \space{} \begin{bmatrix}
L_{encoded} \\
R_{encoded}
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Now you can easily obtain formulas to express the three front components as functions of the encoded left and right signals.  For the two rear components, you have an equation in the time domain with a complex component.

Looking at the left rear component, and converting constants from the matrix $ D $ to numeric form:
$$
L_{rear}'[n] = -i0.2949 L_{encoded}[n] + i0.1787 R_{encoded}[n]
$$

The Hilbert transform can be used to remove the imaginary unit, because this has the same effect on the frequency domain of performing a ±90º phase shift.  The Hilbert transform only needs to be applied once, since convolution ($ * $) is distributive and commutative and all other good things.
$$
L_{rear}'[n] = (-0.2949 L_{encoded}[n] + 0.1787 R_{encoded}[n]) * H[n]
$$

The operating principle, then, is that the encoding technique functions in part by encoding the left/right rear components in quadrature.

The Hilbert transform is infinitely long, so it must be truncated and expressed as either a FIR filter, or depending on your circumstances, a FFT-IFFT operation.  A causal Hilbert transform will delay the rear channels, so your other filters will need to be delayed by some amount to compensate.

For example, if $ k $ is the group delay of a causal approximation of a Hilbert filter $ H_k[n] $ then you delay must delay the three front channels by $ k $ as well:
$$
C'[n] = (0.3437L_{encoded}[n] + 0.3437R_{encoded}[n]) * \delta[n-k]
$$

In practice, all of the output signals depend on the two input signals.  That is, you take two input channels and produce one output channel five times.  Your JACK pipeline will need to accommodate this.

1935,1935,3086,Timing inside a shift register,"How I imagine synchronous digital networks work: data lines are sampled at rising clock edge, a set of transients occur, system settles, and data lines are sampled again on next rising edge. I would place transients at falling clock edges, that way both Tsu and Th time for sampling are clear. (Somewhat similar to SPI bus behavior.)

What see in a datasheet of a real world device (74595): D flipflops connected in series having a common clock. At the output of the first flipflop, transient on the data line follows rising clock edge with Tpd. The next flipflop needs Th time stable data line after rising edge to operate correctly. Of course it works because Tpd>Th, but it's only a matter of nanoseconds.

My problem with all this is that it's not robust (maybe not the best word). Visualizing stuff on a logic analyzer will be less useful because data lines practically change in sync with clock rising edge. Random errors caused by Th>Tpd are not really visible and go undetected. If I connect another shift register in series from a different technology, which requires longer hold times, the circuit won't work, no matter how slow clock I chose.

Is this the way most commonly synchronous digital circuits are constructed? Only the propagation delay of components make it work? Am I being to idealistic? :)

You bring up two issues. Let's call the two synchronous circuits A and B, where A feeds into B, and both share the same clock


Circuit won't work if total Tpd(A) &lt; Th(B) where Tpd is the combinational delay of the clock. Is this true? Absolutely! You're the circuit designer and it's your final responsibility to make sure the circuit works. In reality, it's not usually a source of worry; even if you feed one register output right into another's input, the design margin of the chip's specs is high. For a NXP 74HC595, for example, typical propagation delay at 4.5V supply is 19ns, required hold time is 3nsec, and typical hold time is -2nsec -- no problem there. For a TI SN74LV595A at 5V, typical propagation delay is 4.5nsec, minimum propagation delay is 1nsec, required hold time is 2nsec. Could this be a problem if the propagation delay and hold times are at their worst case? Absolutely. Could it be a problem if you cascade a SN74LV595A into an NXP74HC595? Absolutely. In those cases you may need to add combinational elements (buffers) with enough delay to make sure the hold time is met.
""Visualizing stuff on a logic analyzer will be less useful because data lines practically change in sync with clock rising edge."" True. Take a tip from SPI buses, and set the logic analyzer so that it samples the data on the clock falling edge.

5807,5807,9200,Combined gas law in an open atmosphere,"The question was asked about pressure vs. Volume increasing in an ideal gas as temperature is increased. My question then is this. What is the formula to determine how much volume and pressure will increase as temperature is increased?

Let me frame the question this way. PV/T=P2V2/T2 this formula works for a controlled system where more than one of these values can be maintained. If we apply a known amount of heat, say n, to the atmosphere, what formula would be used to calculate volume and pressure as the temperature is increased?
",Diamondhills,https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/27405,"Technically speaking, If you managed to create a planet with an ideal gas atmosphere, the atmosphere would just float away. Why?

One of the approximations of an ideal gas is 


  
  There are no attractive or repulsive forces between the molecules or the surroundings
  


This means that the gas wouldn't feel the force of gravity!
So if I had a jar of ideal gas, the pressure wouldn't increase as I went to a greater depth in the jar(It does increase in gasses too, just like it does in liquids).

I know this sounds strange but all it really means is that you cannot apply the ideal gas approximation to a system the size of our atmosphere. This approximation works well for small systems(A jar of ideal gas), because the effects of gravity are pretty negligible.

So to analyse effects of change in temperature on the whole atmosphere, you'll need a better model. Maybe considering the atmosphere a non-viscous fluid can help, I don't know. You should research on this.

Note that other approximations like the Van der Waals equation wouldn't help too because they too neglect the effect of gravity.

2329,2329,3712,Equivalent of Java 1.6 @Override for interfaces in C#,"This question gives the answer that Java's @Override has the C# equivalent of the override keyword on methods. However, since Java 1.6 the @Override annotation can be applied to interfaces also.

The practical use for this is that in Java you get compile errors when a class claims it implements an interface method when it no longer does (e.g. if the interface method is removed). Is there equivalent functionality in C#?

Some code examples:

Java:

public interface A {
  public void foo();
  // public void bar(); // Removed method.
}

public class B implements A {
  @Override public void foo();
  @Override public void bar(); // Compile error
}


C#:

public interface IA {
  void Foo();
  // void Bar(); // Removed method.
}

public class B : A {
  public override void Foo(); // Doesn't compile as not 'overriding' method
  public void Bar(); // Compiles, but no longer implements interface method
}

",Bringer128,https://stackoverflow.com/users/545680,"There is similar functionality: explicit interface implementation.

public interface IA { 
  void foo(); 
  // void bar(); // Removed method. 
} 

public class B : IA { 
  void IA.foo() {}
  void IA.bar() {} // does not compile
} 


The problem is that if you do this you cannot call the methods through the this pointer (from inside the class) or through an expression that evaluates to a B -- it is now necessary to cast to IA.

You can work around that by making a public method with the same signature and forwarding the call to the explicit implementation like so:

public class B : IA { 
  void IA.foo() { this.foo(); }
  public void foo() {}

public interface IA { 
  void foo();

} 


The problem is that if you do this you cannot call the methods through the this pointer (from inside the class) or through an expression that evaluates to a B -- it is now necessary to cast to IA.

You can work around that by making a public method with the same signature and forwarding the call to the explicit implementation like so:

public class B : IA { 
  void IA.foo() { this.foo(); }
  public void foo() {}
}

3028,3028,4827,The graph has an Euler tour iff in-degree($v$)=out-degree($v$),"I am looking at the proof that $G$ has an Euler tour iff in-degree($v$)=out-degree($v$), that I found at this site: www.cs.duke.edu/courses/fall09/cps230/hws/hw3/headsol.pdf  (Problem 2)

A simple cycle is a path in a graph that starts and ends at the same vertex without passing through the same vertex more than once.

A complex cycle is a cycle that passes through the same vertex more than once. We can easily decompose a complex cycle to a set of simple cycles by breaking up the cycle at those points where the cycle passes through the same vertex more than once.

As the first part of our proof, we will prove that if $G$ has an Euler tour, in-degree($v$)=out-degree($v$) for each vertex $v \in V$.

We have already established that a complex cycle can be decomposed to a collection of simple cycles. However vertices on a simple cycle have in-degree($v$)=out-degree($v$)=1.

Since each vertex in a complex cycle, and therefore in an Euler tour, is part of one or more simple cycles it will have in-degree($v$)=out-degree($v$).


Could you give me an example of a complex cycle that is decomposed to a set of simple cycles, where we can see that in-degree($v$)=out-degree($v$)?


The second part of our proof requires us to prove that if in-degree($v$)=out-degree($v$) for each vertex $v \in V$, $G$ has an Euler-tour.

Let $C$ be the complex cycle involving the most edges in $G$.

In order for $G$ not to be an Euler tour, there must be some vertices that $C$ passes through ( since the graph is connected ) but does not exhaust all edges. We have already established that the vertices of a complex cycle have the property that in-degree($v$)=out-degree($v$). Therefore $G'=G-C$ will also have that property. If a connected component in a graph has in-degree($v$)=out-degree($v$) then it contains at least one cycle $C'$. However this contradicts our initial hypothesis that $C$ is the cycle involving the most edges in $G$ since we would construct a larger cycle by starting at some common vertex of $C$ and $C'$, traversing all of $C$s edges and then $C'$s edges. Therefore $C$ is an Euler tour.


First of all, it says that ""In order for $G$ not to be an Euler tour, there must be some vertices that $C$ passes through ( since the graph is connected ) but does not exhaust all edges. "" 


I haven't understood why we have to show that $G$ does not exhaust all edges. In order for $G$ not to be an Euler tour, couldn't it also hold that  $G$ traverses an edge more than once?

Then it says that ""We have already established that the vertices of a complex cycle have the property that in-degree($v$)=out-degree($v$). Therefore $G'=G-C$ will also have that property.""

Why will $G'=G-C$ be a complex cycle, although $G$ isn't necessarily?

Also, could you explain me why it holds that: "" If a connected component in a graph has in-degree($v$)=out-degree($v$) then it contains at least one cycle $C'$.""

Finally, could you explain me the contradiction?

EDIT: I also want to describe an algorithm that runs in time $O(E)$ and finds an Euler tour of $G$, if it exists. (Hint: Merge edge-disjoint cycles.) 
If we apply DFS, we will get a set of cycles formed by disjoint sets of edges, right? But how can we know if it holds that in-degree(v)=out-degree(v), for all vertices in $V$?

Do we have to do something like that?  algorithm
",evinda,https://math.stackexchange.com/users/75843,"In a simple cycle the in degree and the out degree are both one, so if we add to some simple cycle another simple cycle at some vertex, the in degree and the out degree of the vertex will increase both by 1. 

You got some wrong concept on $G'$, it is not a complex cycle in fact it doesn't even need to be connected. As we defined cycles in my (algorithmic) dicrete math classes we said that every edge may be traversed at most once so it is not possible that $C$ is a complex cycle which traverses one edge more than once. 

So the idea is more that there must be some complex cycle which passes trough every vertex, because your graph is connected, and if uses every edge it is an euler tour. So we take the complex cycle with most edges, and look at $G'=G-C$, as the in degree of some vertex in $G'$ is the in degree of the vertex in $G$ minus the in degree of the vertex in $C$ and the same for the out degrees the graph $G'$ does still have the property, that the in degrees coincide with the out degrees. But if those degrees aren't all $0$ we could add some cycle to $C$ which would result in some complex cycle with more edges, which is some contradiction to our assumption, that $C$ does have the most edges.

230,230,367,How can I resend an application on Careers?,"I applied for a job a year ago, and things didn't pan out then and I didn't hear back.  

I'd like to resubmit my application as the job has been reposted and my skillset has become broader, but Careers doesn't let me send an application again, it just says ""You applied for this position on {date last year}.  Good luck!"" with no ""apply now"" button.

In my Messages section, I can view the application but there's no way to withdraw the application or anything, and I can't even post a comment to it as I have a message saying ""You must wait until the employer responds to your application.""  It's been a year; I don't think they are going to respond to the old application after so long, but I'm left with no way to resubmit my information to them.

It seems counter-intuitive and unlike other job sites that you basically get only one chance to apply to a job, even if said job gets reposted at a later date.  There should either be a way to resubmit an application, withdraw an application, or the system should allow reapplying after some arbitrary amount of time has passed so you aren't left seeing a job that you're a good fit for this time around but with no way to apply for it since you already applied once before.

5770,5770,9146,Seperation of drawing and logic in games,"I'm a developer that's just now starting to mess around with game development. I'm a .Net guy, so I've messed with XNA and am now playing around with Cocos2d for the iPhone. My question really is more general though. 

Let's say I'm building a simple Pong game. I'd have a Ball class and a Paddle class. Coming from the business world development, my first instinct is to not have any drawing or input handling code in either of these classes.

//pseudo code
class Ball
{
   Vector2D position;
   Vector2D velocity;
   Color color;
   void Move(){}
}


Nothing in the ball class handles input, or deals with drawing. I'd then have another class, my Game class, or my Scene.m (in Cocos2D) which would new up the Ball, and during the game loop, it would manipulate the ball as needed.

The thing is though, in many tutorials for both XNA and Cocos2D, I see a pattern like this:

//pseudo code
class Ball : SomeUpdatableComponent
{
   Vector2D position;
   Vector2D velocity;
   Color color;
   void Update(){}
   void Draw(){}
   void HandleInput(){}
}


My question is, is this right? Is this the pattern that people use in game development? It somehow goes against everything I'm used to, to have my Ball class do everything. Furthermore, in this second example, where my Ball knows how to move around, how would I handle collision detection with the Paddle? Would the Ball need to have knowledge of the Paddle? In my first example, the Game class would have references to both the Ball and the Paddle, and then ship both of those off to some CollisionDetection manager or something, but how do I deal with the complexity of various components, if each individual component does everything themselves? (I hope I'm making sense.....)
",BFree,https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/users/4911,"I recently made a simple Space Invadors game using an 'entity system'.  It's a pattern that separates attributes and behaviours extremely well.  It took me a few iterations to fully understand it, but once you get a few components designed it becomes extremely simples to compose new objects using your existing components.

You should read this:

http://t-machine.org/index.php/2007/09/03/entity-systems-are-the-future-of-mmog-development-part-1/

It's updated frequently by an extremely knowledgable guy.  It's also the only entity system discussion with concrete code examples.

My iterations went as follows:

The first iteration had an ""EntitySystem"" object which was as Adam describes; however my components still had methods- my 'renderable' component had a paint() method, and my position component had a move() method and etc.  When I began to flesh out the entities I realized that I needed to start passing message between components and ordering the execution of components updates....way too messy.

So, I went back and re-read T-machines blog.  There is a lot of information in the comment threads- and in them he really emphasizes that components do not have behaviours- behaviours are provided by the entity systems.  In this way you do not need to pass messages between components and order component updates because the ordering is determined by the global order of system execution.  Ok.  Maybe that's too abstract.

Anyway for iteration #2 this is what I gleaned from the blog:

EntityManager - acts as the component ""database"", which can be queried for entities which contain certain types of components.  This can even be backed by an in-memory database for speedy access...see t-machine part 5 for more info.

EntitySystem - Each system is essentially just a method which operates on a set of entites.  Each system will use component x,y and z of an entity to get it's work done.  So you would query the manager for entities with components x,y and z then pass that result to the system.

Entity - just an id, like a long.  The entity is what groups a set of components instances together into an 'entity'.

Component - a set of fields....no behaviours!  when you start adding behaviours it starts to get messy...even in a simple Space Invadors game.

Edit: by the way, 'dt' is the delta time since the last main loop invocation

So my main Invadors loop is this:

Collection&lt;Entity&gt; entitiesWithGuns = manager.getEntitiesWith(Gun.class);
Collection&lt;Entity&gt; entitiesWithDamagable =
manager.getEntitiesWith(BulletDamagable.class);
Collection&lt;Entity&gt; entitiesWithInvadorDamagable = manager.getEntitiesWith(InvadorDamagable.class);

keyboardShipControllerSystem.update(entitiesWithGuns, dt);
touchInputSystem.update(entitiesWithGuns, dt);
Collection&lt;Entity&gt; entitiesWithInvadorMovement = manager.getEntitiesWith(InvadorMovement.class);
invadorMovementSystem.update(entitiesWithInvadorMovement);

Collection&lt;Entity&gt; entitiesWithVelocity = manager.getEntitiesWith(Velocity.class);
movementSystem.move(entitiesWithVelocity, dt);
gunSystem.update(entitiesWithGuns, System.currentTimeMillis());
Collection&lt;Entity&gt; entitiesWithPositionAndForm = manager.getEntitiesWith(Position.class, Form.class);
collisionSystem.checkCollisions(entitiesWithPositionAndForm);


It looks a little weird at first, but it's incredibly flexible.  It's also very easy to optimize; for different component types you can have different backing datastores to make retrieval faster.  For the 'form' class you can have it backed with a quadtree to speed access for collision detection.

I'm like you; I'm a seasoned developer but had no experience writing games.  I spent a some time researching gave dev patterns, and this one caught my eye.  It is in no way the only way to do things, but I've found it very intuitive and robust.  I believe the pattern was officially discussed in book 6 of the series ""Game Programming Gems"" - http://www.amazon.com/Game-Programming-Gems/dp/1584500492.  I haven't read any of the books myself but I hear they are the de-facto reference for game programming.

5826,5826,9232,Why does Wizards of the Coast print terrible MTG cards?,"I understand that there needs to be a wide variety of power levels in Magic: The Gathering. Even bad cards will see play in limited formats, some because they fill a specific niche (flying removal, fat colorless flyer, providing a counter to certain decks), and others because those decks can't afford to be too picky. However, some cards are just unforgivably terrible. I'm talking about cards that you would only run in sealed if you had absolutely no other options:

Mindless Null: Black 2/2 for 3 with a big disadvantage

Defensive Stance: literally does nothing in exchange for you getting card disadvantage 

Merfolk of the Depths: Would still be bad if it only costed 5...

Archangel's Light: 8 mana just to gain some life and put cheap cards back into your deck. And it's a mythic rare....

There are many more examples, but I think these best illustrate my case. Obviously I'd rather have these cards in the game than not have them at all, but I feel like Wizards of the Coast could have made Magic a more enjoyable game just by keeping the flavor and making all of these cards a tiny bit better...yet they didn't. Why?
",Gordon Gustafson,https://boardgames.stackexchange.com/users/191,"Tom LaPille, When Cards Go Bad, Part 2, a followup to the first When Good Cards Go Bad article thesunneversets linked, has a few more points that haven't been fully explored yet.

Some cards aren't fun when they're good.

Here he uses the example of Scrambleverse, which has really cumbersome and complicated mechanics, explaining that it is costed very high so that it doesn't get played often. The only people that play it are the people that really want to.

Limited needs to be balanced.

I think Limited play is the biggest reason there are ""bad"" cards in modern MtG. From the article:


  …there was a meeting when both blue and black were doing much better than we wanted in our playtests. Lead developer Aaron Forsythe decreed that we needed a weak blue card and a weak black card. None of us came up with a blue card that was weak enough, so Aaron created Defensive Stance to fill the hole.


So while Defensive Stance does have some narrow infect-hosing mechanic, it was basically created just to keep blue drafters in New Phyrexia in check.

Draft needs to be human-processable.


  Drafting is a complex enough task already without every card being extremely close together in power, so we include plenty of cards of widely differing power levels so that the right answer can be a little bit less ambiguous. This doesn't simplify the task of correctly identifying those power levels—a challenging task in itself!—but it does make deciding between correctly-identified power levels a little bit easier.


Imagine if every card in a pack had the same power-level. I have a hard enough time deciding between two or three similar power-level cards in a draft. If all cards had a similar power level, each decision becomes stressful and agonizing. Drafts would slow to a crawl. If there are some ""last pick"" cards and definite common ""bombs"", it makes the draft a bit more smooth and manageable.

2671,2671,4256,"Why do airlines (typically?) require customers to phone for special meals, and not provide this option online?","When travelling on flights where meals are included, travellers who need special meals, such as vegetarian or kosher, are, in my experience, typically required to make such a request by phone.

For the traveller, this might mean a 15 minute hold, followed by a 1 minute phonecall.  After all, the operator simply needs to make an entry into a database somewhere.

Why don't airlines offer seem to offer travellers the option to select their special meal request through an online interface?  Or do I just have the bad luck to happen to fly with airlines where this request can only be made by phone?

Examples: Air Transat, Korean Air both require to contact the service centre by telephone.
",gerrit,https://travel.stackexchange.com/users/2509,"I am no definite expert on the topic but this customization of a flight, called ancillary services, are usually marketed to travel agents as a profit generator.

First let's clarify the different actors. The airlines offer and operate flights, the GDS (Global Distribution System) companies distribute the flights to travel agents and the latter sell to the traveller (you). The travel agents can be your local travel agent in his office, the online travel agent (OTA) like Expedia, Opodo or Kayak, or the airline itself through its website, phone service or offices.

In all cases the travel agent decides which ancillary service to sell to the customer. The travel agent probably pays to implement the service distribution (to the GDS) and receives a fee per transaction made. As meal selection is not generally a lucrative option - it is usually free of charge and I think religious or allergic people would react badly if they had to pay to get a specific meal - it is not worth offering for the travel agents. As @drat commented, the airlines have also little incentives (and higher logistic costs) to offer them. So it makes sense not to offer meal choice directly online. Note that some OTAs offer a free text field at the end of the booking without promising it will be read by anyone (I have seen that on govoyages, for example).

In the case of Emirates and Singapore Airlines, I have in mind that their image is based on open-mindedness, globalization and respect of the culture of the travellers. I insist on the fact that it is the image I have, you might not feel the same. But offering a choice of meal is a good marketing argument for a world-wide growing airline. On the opposite, Air Transat mostly targets Canadians visiting the Caribbean and transatlantic travellers, with less of a variety of travellers. Offering a large variety of meals would be more a burden than a marketing argument to them. And Air Transat offers ancillary services on their website like seat selection, so it is a deliberate choice not to offer meal selection.

In the end, I suppose that the reasons are economical. It costs less to offer less choice and not to prepare too many meals. It depends on the travel agent you buy your tickets from, but there is no rule for who offers meal selection or does not. If it matters a lot, you can try to buy your ticket from another travel agent, it might work better.

Let's suppose the signal is sinusoidal, with a frequency of 500&nbsp;Hz and an amplitude of 2.

If I sample it, (replacing t=nTs , Ts = sampling period and n represent number of samples) and plotting the sampled signals with a different sampling period using the subplot command in MATLAB, how could I identify the aliasing in a sampled signal?

Here is the example code that plotted two signals, one at the Nyquist rate while the other less than the Nyquist rate:

A = 2;
Fmax = 10;
Fs = 2*Fmax;
n = 0:1/Fs:1;
Cont = A*sin(2*pi*(Fmax/Fs)*n);
Cont1 = A*sin(2*pi*(Fmax/18)*n);

A single aliased sinusoidal component looks just like a non-aliased sinusoid. If you want to experience aliasing, you have to attempt it with either a more complex waveform or a sinusoid that is changing in time.

One way to ""experience aliasing"" is to undersample a chirp in the following way:

Fs = 8000;t=0:(1./Fs):(5-1./Fs);p=2.*pi.*t; %Sampling Frequency, Time Vector, Phase Vector
y1 = chirp(t,0,5,Fs/2.0); %Create a chirp that goes from DC to Fs/2.0
spectrogram(y1); %Have a look at it through spectrogram, please pay attention at the axis labels. This is basically going to be a ""line"" increasing with time.
soundsc(y1,Fs); %Listen to it...It clearly ""goes up"" in frequency
y2 = chirp(t,0,5,Fs); %Now create a chirp that goes from DC to Fs
spectrogram(y2); %Have a look at it through spectrogram
soundsc(y2,Fs); %Listen to it...Do you ""get"" the folding of the spectrum?


In general, you can think of Sampling as Modulation because this is what is effectively happening at the sample and hold element of an ADC converter. 

This will enable you to understand more easily concepts like undersampling for example (and applications where it is perfectly OK to sample at lower than the Nyquist rates). But also, you can load a WAV file in MATLAB (with 'wavread') containing some more complex signal and prior to listening to it with 'soundsc', simply multiply it with a ""square"" wave* (you might want to lookup function 'square') at some frequency lower than the WAV file's $F_s$. This will effectively introduce the key (unwanted) characteristic of aliasing which is this folding of the spectrum. The result is not very pleasant so you might want to keep your speakers volume down.

I hope this helps.

*EDIT: Obviously, ""square"" returns a square with an amplitude in the interval [-1,1] so prior to multiplying it with your signal it would be better to rescale it as:

aSquareWave = (square(100.*p)+1.0)/2.0 % Where p is the phase vector and here we are producing a square wave at 100Hz (given an Fs of 8kHz as above). aSquareWave's amplitude is now in the interval [0,1]

5793,5793,9179,Examples of two different descriptions of a set that are not obviously equivalent?,"I am teaching a course in enumerative combinatorics this semester and one of my students asked for deeper clarification regarding the difference between a ""combinatorial"" and a ""bijective"" proof.  Specifically, they pointed out that when one is proving the validity of a combinatorial identity by counting a set in two different ways, this is a different activity than giving an explicit bijection between two different sets.  However, in combinatorics we often use the phrases ""combinatorial proof"" and ""bijective proof"" as synonyms, and I have often heard people use the phrase ""bijective proof"" regarding a ""count in two different ways"" proof of an identity.

It seems to me that often a combinatorial proof arises from describing one set in two different ways; implicit in a proof of the equality of the two descriptions of this set is the identity bijection from the set to itself.  In this sense, one might regard all ""combinatorial"" proofs as ""bijective,"" but I feel that I am on quite shaky ground with this.  These thoughts have led me to the following questions:

Question 1: What are some examples of combinatorial situations where the same set can be described in two different ways but it is not at all clear that the two descriptions yield the same object?

Question 2: What are some examples of situations where two bijective proofs have been given for a theorem or identity where the bijections turned out to be the same, but proving their equivalence was non-trivial?

I would also appreciate opinions regarding the distinction, if any, between combinatorial arguments where one proves identities by describing a set in two different ways and combinatorial arguments where one sets up bijections between genuinely different sets of objects.

EDIT

Thanks for the answers and comments so far.  Here are two examples that will hopefully clarify what I am asking.  One example of a bijective proof between two different sets are showing that Dyck paths and nonnesting partitions are both Catalan-enumerated objects (even preserving the Narayana statistic with a good bijection).  On the other hand, the identity $\sum_{k=0}^nk{n\choose k}=n2^{n-1}$ is usually proved by describing $k$-subsets of $n$ with a distinguished element in two different ways: in the first way, pick the set then specify the element; in the second way, pick the element then specify the rest of the set.  These are both referred to as bijective or combinatorial proofs, yet somehow they each have a different feel to them.  In the second case, it is pretty easy to see that the two descriptions of these objects yield the same set of objects, but surely there must be more situations where the same set is described in two different ways and the equivalence of their descriptions is difficult to ascertain.  Similarly, there must be times where there are several bijections between different sets, like the first example, where the bijections are the same but not obviously so.  What I am wondering about are examples of these two situations.

A non-combinatorial example of an answer to Q1 is the compact-group vs reflection group definition of the Weyl group of a semi-simple Lie Algebra, where it isn't immediately clear that the same group is obtained.  However, I am looking for more combinatorial examples.

Producing New Bijections from Old by David Feldman and James Propp (published in Advances in Mathematics, volume 113 (1995), pages 1-44)

which you can find here http://jamespropp.org/cancel.ps.gz .

Establishing a definition of bijective proof turns out difficult since it hinges on the distinction between proving the existence of a bijection and using a bijection to establish an equality.  One would like to trade in this syntactic problem (distinguishing a class of proofs) for a semantic problem - a mathematical universe where one can distinguish between mere numerical equality and the existence of a bijection.

Topos theory offers one approach.  There one can have two sheaves with a bijection between every stalk of one and every stalk of the other, but no global isomorphism of the sheaves.  Alternatively, one can have two sets of the same cardinality that carry different actions by the same finite group $G$.  

This may all see to be getting away from the real world, but what Jim and I show in the paper is that it all does have bankable implications for relative questions about the existence of bijections.  For example, if you have sets $A$ and $B$ and you find a bijection between $A^2$ and $B^2$, our paper gives you an concrete effective way to get a bijection between $A$ and $B$.  We also give a group-theoretical criterion that predicts the existence
of this effective reduction before you actually have it in your hands.

On the other hand, we show that a bijection between $2^A$ and $2^B$ does not effectively give rise to a bijection between $A$ and $B$.  Such a bijection might be too symmetrical, and we actually write down a concrete example to show you how things can go wrong.

Pedagogically speaking, I have often encountered two diametrically opposite and equally difficult lessons.  I have encountered many students who don't understand why you don't need the axiom of choice to pick out one element from one non-empty set (with more than one element)...in classical mathematics, say ZF.  And I have encountered just as many students who don't understand why you do need the axiom of choice to pick out one element from a two element set...in effective, or intuitionistic mathematics, or in a topos.

which you can find here http://jamespropp.org/cancel.ps.gz .

Establishing a definition of bijective proof turns out difficult since it hinges on the distinction between proving the existence of a bijection and using a bijection to establish an equality.  One would like to trade in this syntactic problem (distinguishing a class of proofs) for a semantic problem - a mathematical universe where one can distinguish between mere numerical equality and the existence of a bijection.

Topos theory offers one approach.  There one can have two sheaves with a bijection between every stalk of one and every stalk of the other, but no global isomorphism of the sheaves.  Alternatively, one can have two sets of the same cardinality that carry different actions by the same finite group $G$.  

This may all see to be getting away from the real world, but what Jim and I show in the paper is that it all does have bankable implications for relative questions about the existence of bijections.  For example, if you have sets $A$ and $B$ and you find a bijection between $A^2$ and $B^2$, our paper gives you an concrete effective way to get a bijection between $A$ and $B$.  We also give a group-theoretical criterion that predicts the existence
of this effective reduction before you actually have it in your hands.

On the other hand, we show that a bijection between $2^A$ and $2^B$ does not effectively give rise to a bijection between $A$ and $B$.  Such a bijection might be too symmetrical, and we actually write down a concrete example to show you how things can go wrong.

Pedagogically speaking, I have often encountered two diametrically opposite and equally difficult lessons.  I have encountered many students who don't understand why you don't need the axiom of choice to pick out one element from one non-empty set (with more than one element)...in classical mathematics, say ZF.  And I have encountered just as many students who don't understand why you do need the axiom of choice to pick out one element from a two element set...in effective, or intuitionistic mathematics, or in a topos.

2944,2944,4686,Can you estimate whether or not the sky is clear from a photographs metadata?,"I am using remote sensing (satellite) images and am trying and differentiate (automatically i.e. using a computer and without viewing the image myself) between areas that fall under cloud cover (with respect to the sun, not with respect to the satellite), the clouds themselves, and areas that are receiving full sunlight.

It is proving difficult to find sources of data to be able to validate the method I am using and I am now looking outside the box. My question is this: would it be possible to use combination of metadata (such as mentioned in this question) from an image file to estimate whether or not the photograph was taken under clear sky conditions or cloudy conditions?

The estimation does not need to be very accurate, more along the lines of ""lots of natural light"", ""not a lot of natural light"".

EDIT for clarity:  

I am able to identify clouds in the satellite images quite easily and flag the pixels in a pre-processing step, but its is not possible to validate that all the pixels in thousands of these processed images have been correctly flagged. Thus I am concerned with using any information possible from photographs taken on the ground to see if I can validate that the pixels that contain cloud cover have been correctly flagged.

I have a block I created in Views called ""handy_tips-block_1"".

Now I want to insert it into the body field of my node.

How do I do this?

I found a guide on here, which suggests to use the following code:

print render($block['content']['#content']);
?&gt;


However, all what is printed out are the words ""Array"".
(I have enabled the PHP input filter for the body field).

Note: in the posted code, I have also tried substituting 'views' with various items such as ""block"". I have used 'handy_tips-block_1' as the ID, because that is what is displayed on the configuration link of the block administration page. 
",big_smile,https://drupal.stackexchange.com/users/1606,"My favorite way to embed views in template files is with the views_embed_view() function.

The 'display-name' argument corresponds to the type of display in your view, and the number of those types of there are multiple. So if in your view you created two blocks, you could call one or the other by using 'block-1' or 'block-2' in the 'display-name' argument.

The product is an application and is heavy on user interaction.  Think web 2.0 or mobile application, not a marketing or commerce site, or some back-end tool with only command-line access.
I realize that it is not always clear who is a UX person and who is a developer (nor should it be), so I'd like to focus on overall team resource allocation.  For instance, ""My team puts 25% of our resource-time into UX design/research vs. 75% of our resource-time in development.""  
I am not distinguishing between front-end and back-end development as it is too platform-specific and difficult to tease out the dividing like.  It's all software development for this question.
EDIT: Development is occurring in an agile-esque, ongoing manner, rather than a one-time, big-bang delivery.


So:


How does this proportion commonly look in practice?
How should it look?  Or, better yet, what has been the proportion on successful teams?

And the ability specifies that anyone attacking the golem with unarmed or natural attacks will take 1d6 cold damage. If it also worked against grapple attempts with barehands, it should specify so.


If a simple touch would also cause that damage, the ability would make that clear, because it would also affect casters trying to deliver touch spells.
As written, all rules must be clear how an ability should work or not, anything that isn't clear is left for each GM to decide, which brings us to...

Rules as Intended

Though the ability's wording is clear that simply touching it shouldnt cause the extra damage to you, that is clearly not how it is intended to work. But i simply believe nobody asked themselves What would happen if someone tried to grapple this guy? during the development process.

A fine example of that are Fire Elementals and their Burn ability. What should happen when you hug a big ball of flames? You should hurt yourself in the process, and most likely catch on fire.

Personally, this is how i would rule it on my table.


  If a Golem were to initiate a grapple, would this ability trigger
  dealing damage to grappled target?


Now, if a fire elemental or ice golem initiated a grapple, RaW it wouldnt deal an extra damage, because you can attack the grappled target with a unarmed, natural weapon or light/1handed weapon, that should deal the ice damage.
But RaI, it would be really nasty to get your arm/leg freeze while being punched in the face by ice blocks. Golems hardly would initiate a grapple due to their intelligence score, but i could see a fire elemental doing so to bring a burning death to their foes.


  If so, would this be on the Golem's turn, on the target's turn, or on
  both turns?


On the golem's turn if he initiated the grapple, on the grappler's turn if the golem is grappled.

I see no problem advising students, as I often similarly came for help when I was an undergraduate. Recently, though, I found an increase in students who apparently just want to abuse this:


Students will bring me some plagiarized work, showing it to me early, as a sort of test if I will notice. It seems difficult to punish plagiarism when the paper is not yet submitted.
Students will bring in papers again and again, with little changes put in at each stage, hoping their minimal effort each time will be sufficient to reach their goal of a ""D"".


I've tried stopping students, but then they are angry when they see the ""F"" that they hoped I would help them get away from.

From Credit Karma:



That being said, depending on the loan type you looking at receiving (FHA, VA, Conventional, etc), there are certain max DTIs that you want to stay away from. As a rule, for VA, you want to try to stay away from 41% DTI. Exceptions are made for people with sufficient funds in the bank (3-9 months) to go to higher DTIs. If you keep a 19% utilization overall, that will get you a higher score but it will also show that you have a monthly payment on a particular revolving credit account. While the difference between 729 and 745 seems like a lot of points, there are rules as to how the interest rates are determined. So you will find that many banks have the same or similar rates due to recent legislation in Dodd-Frank. In the days of subprime mortgages, this was not the case. Adjustable rate mortgages did not necessarily go away, the servicer just has to make sure that the buyer can weather the full amount once it reaches maturity, not the lower amount. That is what got a lot of people in trouble.

From ""how interest rates are set"":


  Before quoting you an interest rate, the loan officer will add on how
  much he and his branch want to earn. The branch or company sets a
  policy on how little that can be (the minimum amount the loan officer
  adds on to his cost) but does not want to overcharge borrowers either
  (so they set a maximum the loan officer can charge) Between that
  minimum and maximum, the loan officer has a great deal of flexibility.
  
  For example, say the loan officer decides he and his branch are going
  to earn one point. When you call and ask for a rate quote, he will add
  one point to the cost of the loan and quote you that rate. According
  to the rate sheet above, seven percent will cost you zero points. Six
  and three-quarters percent will cost you one point.
  
  In our example, at 7.125% the loan officer and branch would earn one
  point and have some money left over. This could be used to pay some of
  the fees (processing, documents, etc), which is how you get a ""no fees
  -no points"" mortgage. You just pay a higher interest rate.


Where this scoring helps you is in credit card interest rates and auto loan and personal loan rates, which have different rate structures. 

My personal opinion is to avoid the use of the credit cards. Playing games to try to maximize your score in this situation won't help you when you are talking about 20 points potentially. If you were at the bottom level and were trying to meet a minimum score to qualify, then I would recommend you try to game this scoring system.

2058,2058,3280,False positive Apache version in scanner results on Centos,"Recently I need to care a lot of false positive vulnerabilities in scanner results on Apache version.
Example of false positive vulnerability:

Apache 2.2 &lt; 2.2.16 Multiple Vulnerabilities


Our customers run scanners and they check Apache version related to the official Apache version numbering.

We use Centos, and the Apache version numbering is different from the official Apache version numbering.

For example now we install httpd-2.2.15-26.el6.centos.x86_64 and it includes all security patches released by Apache in recent versions.

The Centos Apache version numbering relies on the RedHat Apache version numbering and they do not change the base number (httpd-2.2.15) each update.
But scanners do not “understand” this and check that 2.2.15 &lt; 2.2.16.

Can you point me to the good document that explains the RedHat Apache version numbering?

Do you know if exist scanner that “understand” the RedHat Apache version numbering?

375,375,592,Is it copyright infringement by US copyright law if someone else modifies and uses my design?,"My company is in a small town and there are not any graphic designers but we have enough business in the town and the surrounding area to support us.  But because of the small town nature some business owners do not know all the laws.  And since I am starting this from a career in architecture I am not quite clear on copyrights.  So here is my problem.  

I created a sign that has an oval with scrolls and flowers in different colors on a field of turquoise.  The client did not want to spend the money on a logo design so I said that I will  just retain the rights so that she would have to come to me for the approval to use the logo on anything else.  So anyway everything seems to be fine, I do her business cards and now all of a sudden I see a sign at the street.  I quoted her on this job figuring in using the logo.  Apparently this company did for much less and you can tell by the quality.

But here is my problem.  She had a jpeg that I allowed her to have so she could create her own fliers and I was ok with that since it would not have made me much if any money.  Well I am looking at the sign that the other person did and all that was done is they made a longer oval since this sign is more rectangle and used a different font.  And put this over the design that I did.  To me this is copyright infringement since the client did not want to buy all the rights.  But who do I address?  The client or the person that did the sign?

4847,4847,7715,Why are two eigen-state-kets with different eigenvalues orthogonal?,"The operators $J_1^2$, $J_2^2$, $J_{1z}$, and $J_{2z}$ are mutually commuting operators. Likewise, $J_1^2$, $J_2^2$, $J^2$, and $J_z$ are mutually commuting operators.  The two groups are incompatible, and the simultaneous eigenkets along with their eigenvalues are given by:

${J_1}^2 \left|j_1,j_2;m_1,m_2\right&gt; = j_1 \left(j_1+1\right) \hbar^2 \left|j_1,j_2;m_1,m_2\right&gt;$
${J_2}^2 \left|j_1,j_2;m_1,m_2\right&gt; = j_2 \left(j_2+1\right) \hbar^2 \left|j_1,j_2;m_1,m_2\right&gt;$
$J_{1z} \left|j_1,j_2;m_1,m_2\right&gt; = m_1 \hbar \left|j_1,j_2;m_1,m_2\right&gt;$
$J_{2z} \left|j_1,j_2;m_1,m_2\right&gt; = m_2 \hbar \left|j_1,j_2;m_1,m_2\right&gt;$

and

${J_1}^2 \left|j_1,j_2;j,m\right&gt; = j_1 \left(j_1+1\right) \hbar^2 \left|j_1,j_2;j,m\right&gt;$
${J_2}^2 \left|j_1,j_2;j,m\right&gt; = j_2 \left(j_2+1\right) \hbar^2 \left|j_1,j_2;j,m\right&gt;$
$J^2 \left|j_1,j_2;j,m\right&gt; = j \left(j+1\right) \hbar^2 \left|j_1,j_2;j,m\right&gt;$
$J_z \left|j_1,j_2;j,m\right&gt; = m \hbar \left|j_1,j_2;j,m\right&gt;$

I read that each set of eigenkets are mutually orthogonal [1] (for eigenkets corresponding to different sets of eigenvalues).  This is what I don't understand.  In principle it makes sense, but when I plug in numbers I don't get zero for the inner product.  For example take the first eigenket: $\left|j_1,j_2;m_1,m_2\right&gt;$.  If I choose different eigenvalues for this eigenket (e.g. let $j_1 = 0$ and then let $j_1 = 1$) I get the following:

for $j_1 = 0$ I can have:
$\left|0,j_2;0,m_2\right&gt;$

for $j_1 = 1$ I can have any of the following, since $\left|m_1\right| \leq j_1$:
$\left|1,j_2;-1,m_2\right&gt;$
$\left|1,j_2;0,m_2\right&gt;$
$\left|1,j_2;1,m_2\right&gt;$  

If I take the inner-product of the $j_1 = 0$ eigenket with any of the $j_1 = 1$ eigenkets I do not get zero, e.g.:

$\left&lt;0,j_2;0,m_2 \mid 1,j_2;-1,m_2\right&gt; = {j_2}^2+{m_2}^2$  

which is non-zero unless $j_2 = 0$.  

What am I misunderstanding here? How do you show that eigenkets with different eigenvalues are orthogonal?
",okj,https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/3597,"your line $\left&lt;0,j_2;0,m_2 \mid 1,j_2;-1,m_2\right&gt; = {j_2}^2+{m_2}^2$ is making an assumption about what an inner product must look like. A technical way to express your problem is to note that the sequence of eigenvalues identify an element in a tensor product of vector spaces, not a direct sum. If it was a direct sum, your sum of squares would be right, but it isn't.

Luboš's Answer is completely right, enough so that I upvoted it because he needs all the rep he can get, but it looks like it needs you to know what you're doing already for you to understand it. When you use objects like $\left|j_1,j_2;m_1,m_2\right&gt;$ to represent a state, you implicitly claim that the operators that have the eigenvalues $j_1,j_2;m_1,m_2$ are self-adjoint and mutually commutative. In elementary terms, we can take this to define the inner product on the Hilbert space. We don't know what the inner product is until we've defined it. If the eigenvalues are different, the inner product is defined to be $0$, if the eigenvalues are the same, the inner product is defined to be $1$.

As Luboš says, all the lines above your first introduction of a bra are only about operators acting on a vector space, you haven't got a Hilbert space until you've defined an inner product (and more than that, closure in the norm). Once you've defined an inner product, $(\left|U\right&gt;,\left|V\right&gt;)$, you can define a bra as the object that acts on a vector to get this value, $\left&lt;U \mid V\right&gt;=(\left|U\right&gt;,\left|V\right&gt;)$. There's a theorem that says we can do this if we're properly careful, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riesz_representation_theorem.

A technical way to express your problem is to note that the sequence of eigenvalues identify an element in a tensor product of vector spaces, not a direct sum. If it was a direct sum, your sum of squares would be right, but it isn't.

Luboš's Answer is completely right, enough so that I upvoted it because he needs all the rep he can get, but it looks like it needs you to know what you're doing already for you to understand it. When you use objects like $\left|j_1,j_2;m_1,m_2\right&gt;$ to represent a state, you implicitly claim that the operators that have the eigenvalues $j_1,j_2;m_1,m_2$ are self-adjoint and mutually commutative. In elementary terms, we can take this to define the inner product on the Hilbert space. We don't know what the inner product is until we've defined it. If the eigenvalues are different, the inner product is defined to be $0$, if the eigenvalues are the same, the inner product is defined to be $1$.

As Luboš says, all the lines above your first introduction of a bra are only about operators acting on a vector space, you haven't got a Hilbert space until you've defined an inner product (and more than that, closure in the norm). Once you've defined an inner product, $(\left|U\right&gt;,\left|V\right&gt;)$, you can define a bra as the object that acts on a vector to get this value, $\left&lt;U \mid V\right&gt;=(\left|U\right&gt;,\left|V\right&gt;)$. There's a theorem that says we can do this if we're properly careful, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riesz_representation_theorem.

1900,1900,3027,Flash Memory Failure Modes - Block Failure,"My understanding is that typical flash memory failures, such as those due to erase cycles, occur at the bit level.  I have a flash in which entire blocks (actually two blocks) are failing.  Is there a common explanation for this?  

More specifically, I have two blocks in a NAND flash device which are failing. These blocks are separated by one working block.  The two failing blocks can be erased (I can confirm by reading by all ones), but after programming with 'random' data all of the bits are shown as all zeros.

Both blocks appear to have failed 'simultaneously'

I know that the flash part is nowhere near its max erase-cycle spec of 100k cycles.

Your code has way too many comments, mostly redundant ones - some are even obsolete!

Good comments should say why, not what.


// Create our new excel application and add our workbooks/worksheets
Workbooks workbooks = xls.Workbooks;
Workbook workbook = workbooks.Add();



This comment says what the code is doing, and it's lying - you're not creating a new Excel application, you're using an existing instance. Remove it.


// Hide our excel object if it's visible.
xls.Visible = false;



This comment adds no value, and is lying to a certain extent: you don't actually care whether it's already visible or not. Better just remove it.


// Turn off calculations if set to automatic; this can help prevent memory leaks.
xls.Calculation = xls.Calculation == XlCalculation.xlCalculationAutomatic ? XlCalculation.xlCalculationManual : XlCalculation.xlCalculationManual;



This one is accurate and informative - it says why you're turning off automatic calculations.. but it also says what the code is doing. Better rephrase it:

// turning off automatic calculations improves performance and can help prevent memory leaks.
xls.Calculation = (xls.Calculation == XlCalculation.xlCalculationAutomatic) 
                                    ? XlCalculation.xlCalculationManual 
                                    : XlCalculation.xlCalculationManual;


Notice how readability is improved by splitting the ternary operation into 3 lines. It appears the condition is moot, since both ends produce the same assignation. The instruction should be rewritten as simply:

xls.Calculation = XlCalculation.xlCalculationManual;



// Turn off screen updating so our export will process more quickly.
xls.ScreenUpdating = false;



Again, says what - the why makes it closely related to the previous statement. Thus:

// turning off automatic calculations and screen updating 
// improves performance and can help prevent memory leaks.
xls.Calculation = XlCalculation.xlCalculationManual;

Apparently the code under that comment was moved, but the comment remained.



As for performance, @Will's comment is accurate - COM interop is hurting you here. What's slowing it down is the many calls to the Excel object model (COM interop in itself incurs a performance penalty, but Excel interop somehow makes it even worse). The only way is to limit the number of times you're accessing the Excel object model.

An alternative approach could be to write the data in a .csv file, and use the Excel object model to import the .csv data all in one shot (rather than looping into rows and columns to write the data ""manually""), and then to format the workbook and save it in .xlsx format.

Your code has way too many comments, mostly redundant ones - some are even obsolete!

Good comments should say why, not what.


// Create our new excel application and add our workbooks/worksheets
Workbooks workbooks = xls.Workbooks;
Workbook workbook = workbooks.Add();



This comment says what the code is doing, and it's lying - you're not creating a new Excel application, you're using an existing instance. Remove it.


// Hide our excel object if it's visible.
xls.Visible = false;



This comment adds no value, and is lying to a certain extent: you don't actually care whether it's already visible or not. Better just remove it.


// Turn off calculations if set to automatic; this can help prevent memory leaks.
xls.Calculation = xls.Calculation == XlCalculation.xlCalculationAutomatic ? XlCalculation.xlCalculationManual : XlCalculation.xlCalculationManual;



This one is accurate and informative - it says why you're turning off automatic calculations.. but it also says what the code is doing. Better rephrase it:

// turning off automatic calculations improves performance and can help prevent memory leaks.
xls.Calculation = (xls.Calculation == XlCalculation.xlCalculationAutomatic) 
                                    ? XlCalculation.xlCalculationManual 
                                    : XlCalculation.xlCalculationManual;


Notice how readability is improved by splitting the ternary operation into 3 lines. It appears the condition is moot, since both ends produce the same assignation. The instruction should be rewritten as simply:

xls.Calculation = XlCalculation.xlCalculationManual;



// Turn off screen updating so our export will process more quickly.
xls.ScreenUpdating = false;



Again, says what - the why makes it closely related to the previous statement. Thus:

// turning off automatic calculations and screen updating 
// improves performance and can help prevent memory leaks.
xls.Calculation = XlCalculation.xlCalculationManual;
xls.ScreenUpdating = false;



// Create an excel table and fill it will our query table.



Remove. This one adds no value.


for (int i = 0; i &lt;= iterator; i++)
{
    // Turn off calculations if set to automatic; this can help prevent memory leaks.
    Worksheet worksheet = (Worksheet)xls.Worksheets[i + 1];
    worksheet.Name = excelWorksheetName[i];
    worksheet.Select();

4186,4186,6677,Knots that unknot in a manifold,"Take a closed $n$-manifold $M$ and fix a nice $n$-ball $B$ in $M$. How much information about $M$ does the set of knotted $(n-2)$-spheres of $B$ which are unknotted in $M$ give?
",Mariano Suárez-Álvarez,https://mathoverflow.net/users/1409,"Ryan gives a very nice answer in dimension 3, leaving the higher-dimensional case of the question open.  I can't discuss the question with as much authority as I would like, but I can start to piece together an answer.  My impression is that in any dimension $n$, an $(n-2)$-knot $K$ that is unknotted in $M$ is already unknotted in $B$ in the continuous category.  In the smooth and PL categories, it should be the same except in $n=4$ dimensions, where the question runs into a lack of understanding of smooth (or equivalently PL) structures on 4-manifolds.

First, my impression from skimming some geometric group theory is that a finitely presented group cannot be an infinite free product.  Moreover, that it if it is a finite free product, the factors have unique isomorphism types.  If this impression is correct, then you can identify the knot group $\pi_1(S^n \setminus K)$ from the embedded fundamental group $\pi_1(M \setminus K)$.  In order to be trivial in $M$, the knot group of $K$ would have to be $\mathbb{Z}$.

Then, Aspherical manifolds and higher-dimensional knots, by Bruno Eckmann, begins:


  E. Dyer and R. Vasquez proved that the complement of a higher-dimensional
  knot $S^{n-2} \subset S^n$, $n \ge 4$, is never aspherical unless the knot group is infinite cyclic (and hence, for $n \ge 5$, the imbedding is unknotted). [Footnote referring to papers of Levine, Stallings, Wall, Shaneson.] In the present note we give a simple proof of this fact based on some remarks concerning compact $\partial$-manifolds.


My impression is that the surgery methods in dimension $n \ge 5$ used to prove the unknottedness assertion are valid in the smooth, PL, and continuous categories.  Dimension $n=3$ is of course a special case where you do not need to consider algebraic topology, but instead prove things with direct cut-and-paste arguments as Ryan describes.  In dimension $n=4$, the surgery theory is (a) much more difficult in the continuous category, and (b) non-existent in the smooth/PL category.

The paper The algebraic characterization of the exteriors of certain 2-knots, by Jonathan Hillman, credits Freedman with the result that a 2-knot with knot group $\mathbb{Z}$ is unknotted.  If this requires Freedman's work, then I would think that it is open in the smooth/PL case.  What would be open is whether the 4-manifold with boundary $B^3 \times S^1$ has more than one smooth structure.  If it does, I have seen a principle that smooth structures on a 4-manifold can merge together when you take a connected sum with manifolds such as $\pm \mathbb{C}P^2$ an $S^2 \times S^2$.  I do not know if this principle is established for manifolds with a fundamental group.  But at the very least, I have heard that the semigroup of smooth structures on $S^4$ is completely unknown, and its action on the smooth structures on another 4-manifold is completely unknown.  So if the smooth Poincare conjecture is sufficiently false, presumably you could have a non-trivial 2-knot in $B$ that becomes trivial in $M$.

If you actually want a badge with a dynamic number/text, then you can make the second ImageView a TextView (or a ViewGroup such as LinearLayout or RelativeLayout) and give it a background drawable and set the text to what you want.

1828,1828,2899,Building hand strength for when tapping on the guitar,"I've been practicing on my tapping ability. An example of what I mean by tapping can be viewed here, notice how the right hand hits the strings. 

I'm currently using all four fingers excluding the thumb to tap the guitar. I find my pinky is not as strong as my other fingers when it comes to applying the appropriate strength on the string. What are some exercises I can do to increase my overall finger strength when tapping? More tapping?

As a sidenote, I've noticed that I use the momentum of my forearm to help apply the appropriate pressure on the string I'm trying to hit. If I remove that momentum and only use force created by the movement of my finger the pressure is significantly less. I was hoping these exercises would also help me to not rely on my forearm as much.

1682,1682,2659,Is a VPN really secure at the VPN providers side?,"Please forgive my basic ignorance regarding a VPN connection.

As I understand it, a VPN connection encrypts all the data between my computer and the VPN provider. Thus preventing my ISP from seeing my data.

But on the VPN providers side of the connection, surely the VPN provider uses an ISP of some sort. So they send out requests I have made over their ISP, just as if I were sitting there using the ISP they pay for. And they send the data back to me, encrypted.

So on the ISP side they use, the data they send is unencrypted, so it can be understood by other sites/services.

If this is the case, am I not just pushing my data further along. Its still unencrypted but at a different end (VPNs Webside). Its only the data back to me, which is encrypted.

Windows Server 2003 SP2 with a replication error (this is the only DC in the domain) [image below]: Journal Wrap Error on sysvol share


Is there a way to find out what is broken/corrupt/malformed in this DC's sysvol?  
Is there a way to fix the sysvol share other than from a system-state restore point (which we don't have), or from another domain controller (which we also don't have)?

Rather, too many changes happened in the NTFS volume that hosts the SYSVOL in a short period of time, overflowing the NTFS change journal.

The two recovery methods are described in this Microsoft KB article.

Since you have no replication partners you should be fine performing an authoritative restore (as described in that KB article). In multi-DC scenarios this is not the preferred method.

Basically, you'll stop the File Replication Service (FRS), set the ""burflags"" registry value to ""D4"" (the full path is in the article), and restart the FRS. That should get you back up and running.

Before you try any of that, though, I'd at least make a current System State backup to disk.

You might want to think about getting a second DC after all of this is said and done. It's cheap insurance, makes disaster recovery a LOT easier, and in this scenario would've preserved client access to Group Policy during the outage.

1427,1427,2240,Hyperlink + Javascript = One click?,"Is it possible to integrate a javascript into a hyperlink? Or make it into some sort of batch script or whatnot, so when the page has loaded it calls the javascript which is a button on the page?

To explain it further:

We have this page:
http://work.acceptance.XXXX.com/XXXX_Raffle/Lists/Raffle/overview.aspx

The sharepoint page has a survey on it.
To get the ""popup"" window to show, so you can answer a question in the survey, you need to press a button which calls this script:

javascript:__doPostBack('ctl00$m$g_e999ab40_719f_42fb_bd61_d986f232bdd5$ctl01$ctl00$toolBarTbl$RptControls$ctl00$diidIONewItem','');


So, is it possible to somehow combine the page + the javascript, so all they have to do is press one link or alternatively, a hyperlink which goes to a file on a server which triggers all this, so they instantly get to the page + the javascript automatically pops so they dont have to press the button?

Keep in mind, when I say ""hyperlink"" I mean the kind of hyperlink you would see in an email. A simple link to a website or a server location.

I'm not very good at everything that has to do with programming and webdesign, but I do have access to the sharepoint, though I'd need serious guiding in how to add anything there other than simple webparts. It's SharePoint Server 2010.

1064,1064,1675,Are Mintakans related to Vulcans?,"In TNG ""Who Watches the Watchers"" we learn about the Mintakans, who are described as ""proto-Vulcan humanoids"".  Does this mean that the Mintakans come from a common ancestor to the Vulcans, or does it mean that the two species have evolved coincidentally to share many of the same features? (Or not so coincidentally if you take into account that genetic-seeding by the super ancient humanoids.)

We have been shown many species that look completely like humans, and even entire planets that mirror Earth (TOS ""Miri"") and maybe some of those species could be considered ""proto-human humanoids"".

I don't think it has been defined how long Vulcans have had space travel, or if it's even possible the Vulcans evolved from some other species that had space travel earlier, and the Mintakans are some off-shoot of that species.  This could possibly be justified from what Spock says in TOS ""Return to Tomorrow"" where he seems to suggest in response to Sargon and the astrobiology doctor that there are unexplained issues with Vulcans evolving on the planet Vulcan, that they might have been colonized by Sargon's people instead.

Interesting reading:
http://en.memory-alpha.org/wiki/Vulcan_history
",Sean Fahey,https://scifi.stackexchange.com/users/19629,"Nobody knows.

In ""Return to Tomorrow"" Spock speculated that Vulcans might be descended from Sargon's people more than 600,000 years ago. In any case there might be descendants of other colonies of Sargon's people on other planets, who would look a lot like Sargon's people - whose biological bodies were never seen  but believed by Sargon to resemble Earth Humans or Vulcans.

""Balance of terror"" implies that Vulcan conquered and colonized other planets once, and Romulans seemed to be descendants of those warlike and unreformed ancient Vulcans. It is logical to assume that society on Vulcan and Romulus reverted to barbarism as civilization collapsed during the fall of the Vulcan Empire and it took countless thousands of years for Vulcan and Romulus to rebuild civilization and become space traveling societies again.

STTNG ""Gambit"" mentions ruins of Romulan off-shoot cultures on various planets one being two thousand years old. Thus we may deduce that probably the Romulans regain spaceflight abilities several thousand years ago and later lost them and regained them again just a few centuries ago.

Of course many fans believe in a far different chronology based on Diane Duane's novels, with Vulcan and Romulus both keeping interstellar travel abilities for over two thousand years until the time of STTNG. But that contradicts the chronological implications of the various episodes.

In ""The Paradise Syndrome""  Spock mentions that some Vulcan offshoot cultures use musical notation alphabets. That implies that there were at least two known ones which did so and at least one known one which did not.

The people of Rigel V might be descended from Vulcans and/or Sargon's people, since in ""Journey to Babel"" it was said that their physiology was similar to, but not identical with, Vulcan physiology.

And that is about all the information available to decide whether the Mintakans are descended from Vulcans and/or Sargon's b people or evolved independently to be similar to Vulcans.

Except of course that it hardly needs saying that a planet orbiting a star such as Mintaka would not have time to evolve intelligent life and the Mintakans and/or their planet must have been imported from elsewhere, perhaps by the Preservers.

Leonardo effectively throws shuriken from Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles vol.1 #9


Leonardo (Dual Katanas): The Sword is the weapon of leadership and command. The de facto leader of the Turtles, Leonardo is courageous, decisive, and a disciplined student of martial arts. As a strict adherent to Bushido, he has a very strong sense of honor and justice.
Raphael (Dual Sais): The sai is used both offensively and defensively, can be used to pierce or club an opponent and is able to disarm an opponent. Sais can also be thrown. The team's ""Hot-Head"", Raphael has an aggressive nature and seldom hesitates to throw the first punch. He is also an intense fighter. His personality can be alternately fierce, sarcastic, and full of angst, and oftentimes delivers deadpan humor. Still, he is good-hearted, willing to protect others and is intensely loyal.
Michelangelo (Dual Nunchakus): Nunchaku are fast and deadly, requiring extreme skill and reflexes. Michelangelo is easily the most agile and quick of all the Turtles. The easy-going and free-spirited Michelangelo provides much of the comic relief. While he loves to read comics and eat pizza, this Turtle also has an adventurous side. 
Donatello (Bo Staff): Used to keep an opponent at range, but capable of dealing devastating damage in the hands of a master. The inventor, and technology geek, Donatello has a reputation as something of a smart aleck. He is perhaps the least violent Turtle, preferring to use his intellect to solve conflicts. 
Splinter - The Turtles' sensei and adoptive father, Splinter is a mutant rat who learned the ways of ninjutsu from his own master, Hamato Yoshi. Splinter is able to use any and all martial arts weapons. In the 1987 TV series and Archie Comics series, Splinter was Hamato Yoshi mutated into a rat instead of being just Yoshi's pet.

968,968,1534,"Javascript arrays: Given array[n], get array[n*m]","I'd like to know which would be the best way to solve this problem using javascripts native array methods(map,reduce,etc.). 

Given an array of n objects I want to create another array that will contain m objects for each element in the original array. I can do it using common ""for"" loops to iterate the array but I'd like to know if it can be solved with the native array methods.

Example case:

I have an array with n elements of like ""ObjectA"":

var objectA = {
       name: ""xxx"",
       tels: [""yyy"",""zzz""]
};


I would like to get another array of objects of type ""ObjectB"":

var objectB = {
       name: ""xxx"",
       tel: ""yyy""
};


So in this case, if the first array contained only objectA, the desired result would be:

[
   {
      name: ""xxx"",
      tel: ""yyy""
   },
   {
      name: ""xxx"",
      tel: ""zzz""
   }
]


I've tried using two nested ""map"" calls, but the callback function can only return one element. 

var array1 = [objectA];

var array2 = array1.map(function(objectA){
   return objectA.tels.map(function(tel){
      return {
                 name : objectA.name,
                 tel : tel
              };
   });
});


Returning another array in the callback, generates an array of arrays and it's not what I want. Array2 result:

[
   [
      {
         name: ""xxx"",
         tel: ""yyy""
      },
      {
         name: ""xxx"",
         tel: ""zzz""
      }
   ]

862,862,1370,Wireless link frequency choice (900Mhz vs 5.8Ghz) for 2-3km distance,"I have recently been contracted by a client of mine to facilitate the wireless communication of his ""home"" offices and a secondary site. 

The primary site is the top two floors of a 5-story office building (15m height more or less) an the secondary is one of two open ""lots"" (which one is TBD by management). The ground distance from the secondary sites is a little more than 2km for the one closer and around 2.9km for the one furthest. 

The link will be used to transmit the video feed of 1 (or even possibly two) IP cameras and some kind of Ethernet-enabled environmental or weather sensor. I have checked the necessary b/w for the cameras and both 900Mhz and 5.8Ghz are more than adequate for even 4 of them, much more for 2. I have also verified that there is clear line-of-sight to both possible installation points and that the 60% Fresnel Zone clearance is more than covered. Bear in mind that this is my first long distance link (long with or without quotes) and I hate to admit that wireless physics is far from my strong suit.

The ultimate point of my question is that although I have read a lot about frequency choice the last few days, I continue to find some ambiguity (I know it is just me that finds it ambiguous). Most sources, like this one, agree that although the lower frequencies have less losses over a given distance (free-space-loss I learned it is called) they need larger antennae for the same ""strength"" of trasmission (is ""gain"" really the same as ""strength""?). 

So, for the given distance of 2-3km and given also that all typical requirements are met, which is preferable (or do I dare say ""better"") frequency? Should I choose 900Mhz with a relatively ""small"" antenna on the basis that 3km is not really ""long distance"" and that it will provide a link with less attenuation ergo less retransmits ergo higher overall speed? Or should I choose the 5.8Ghz option for the superior b/w (I am still not very sure about this, please correct me if wrong) on the basis that at this distance there is no real difference so why not take the ""better"" one?

On a side note, should I stay to the beaten path of true WiFi or should I consider proprietary bridging solutions like the ones from Ubiquiti? I have a lot of experience with their Access Points and am really satisfied, so I would not mind integrating one more of their products in my client. In any case, I am looking for an optimal solution, choice of vendor is of very little concern at this point.

Forgive my ignorance and the possible mistaken use of language. 

UPDATE:
I arranged to have a spectrum analyzer on loan for a couple of days. I will make sure that the 900Mhz band is reasonably clear and proceed down that way.

UPDATE 2:
I had the aforementioned equipment available to play with for a day and a half. The conclusive finding is that the 9Mhz band is almost ""empty"" in the area, as one suggested here, so that takes care for the frequency choice issue. 

Concerning the equipment now, I am going with Ubiquiti AirMax Yagi antennae and matching RM900 2x2 radios. Preliminary testing on my part and from the client's employees shows that performance exceeds expectations. 

On a side note, the chosen ""lot"" is the one that is 3km away.

4050,4050,6464,What's the best way to scan in hundreds of pictures?,"I have thousands of old pictures which were sitting in a photo album. Unfortunately, instead of the photo album protecting the pictures, the plastic coverings yellowed, and the pictures themselves had to be carefully extracted from the books. There is also quite a bit of powdered paper (the backings on the books pretty much fell apart while we extracted the pictures), and the fronts of the images are still a bit sticky.

These pictures are 30+ years old, are often extremely faded, and were originally taken on (what I think is) ""110 film"" -- they are approximately 2.5"" squares.

Anyway, I need to scan all these images in to preserve them from further decay. Unfortunately, it's taking forever -- going through less than 100 images took an entire day, even if one discounts any time spent in Photoshop trying to remove some of the photo album's artifacts on the images.

What I really need is some method of scanning the images in faster. Most automated solutions aren't going to work because they accept 4x6s as their smallest image size, and even if that was not the case, the adhesives still stuck to the prints would probably ruin any such device in 5 seconds flat.

3011,3011,4799,"Do airlines replace cancelled short-haul flights by buses? If not, why not?","When trains are cancelled (at least in Europe), and there are no alternative ways to get travellers to their destination by train a little bit later, there are often replaced by buses to get travellers to their destination.

Currently, I've been rebooked twice to get on a flight to a destination that is only 383 km by road.  Originally I should have flown on Monday evening, and currently I'm booked on a flight Wednesday morning, effectively a 36 hour delay.  If the airline had booked a bus, all Monday evening passengers would have arrived to the other airport by Monday night, with perhaps a 4–5 hour delay.  To me, it would make sense from the perspective of customer satisfaction.

Does it happen that airlines offer to bus passengers to their destination when cancellations lead to multi-day delays, but a bus would take only several hours?  If not, why not?



Many passengers, including me, travel to destinations beyond the airport that is 383 km by road, but travelling the short-haul flight segment by bus in order to wait for the first available connection would still benefit travellers.

462,462,718,How does my app know what private key to use,"I have an app that runs on GlassFish 3.x. It communicates to a remote server over https. In my cacerts file I've added the server certs. In my keystore.jks I added the private key the company running the remote server issued me. This works great on Glassfish 2.x, however on 3.x they remote server keeps complaining that the key I have is invalid.

If I remove the key from the keystore I get the same error. It's as if it's not even loading the key, which has got me wondering how does the app / container know which key I need

My connection code looks like this:

public class SSLSocket {

private static Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(SSLSocket.class);
private ConnectionProperties connectionProperties;

public TuSSLSocket(ConnectionProperties connectionProperties) {
    this.connectionProperties = connectionProperties;
}

public SSLSocket getSSLSocket() throws Exception{

    SSLSocket socket = (SSLSocket) factory.createSocket(connectionProperties.getHost(), connectionProperties.getPort());
    socket.setSoTimeout(90000);

    return socket;
}

}


I set the Host and Port accordingly, but no where do I say go look for this alias in the keystore. So... how does the app know what alias to grab?

91,91,151,The Probability of Catching Criminals,"I have been struggling with the following question and would greatly appreciate any help  :)


  Suppose we have information about the supermarket purchases of 100 million people. Each person goes to the supermarket 100 times in a year and buys 10 of the 1000 items that the supermarket sells. We believe that a pair of criminals will buy exactly the same set of 10 items at some time during the year. If we search for pairs of people who have bought the same set of items, would we expect that any such people found were truly criminals? Assume our hypothesis to be that a pair of criminals will surely buy a set of 10 items in common at some time during the year. 


This is meant to be an illustration of Bonferroni's principle. Suppose there are no criminals and that everyone behaves at random. Would we find any pairs of people who appear to be criminals?

We must initially find the expected number of pairs who buy the same 10 items per year. I'm not sure whether I do this correctly...

Here is how I've been going about solving it:

Number of possible pairs of people: $\binom{10^6}{2} = \frac{10^{12}}{2} = 5 \times 10^{11}$, using the fact that $\binom{n}{2} \approx \frac{n^2}{2}$, when $n$ is large.

Number of possible 10-item selections: $\binom{10^3}{10} \approx 2.6 \times 10^{23}$

Probability of a customer buying 10 particular items at a point in time:
$\frac{1}{2.6 \times 10^{23}}$

Probability of a customer buying 10 particular items at least once over the course of 100 periods in time: $\frac{100}{2.6 \times 10^{23}}$

Probability of a pair buying exactly the same 10 items (both at least once) over the course of 100 periods in time: $(\frac{100}{2.6 \times 10^{23}})^2 = (\frac{1}{2.6 \times 10^{21}})^2 = \frac{1}{6.76 \times 10^{42}}$

The expected number of pairs who buy the same 10 items per year is thus:

$ 5 \times 10^{11} \times \frac{1}{6.76 \times 10^{42}} = \frac{5}{6.75 \times 10^{31}}$

Because the above number is so low if we do find a pair buying the same 10 items then, under our hypothesis, they are likely to be criminals and not a false positive case. 

I am just wondering whether my solution to the above is correct?
",user1200428,https://math.stackexchange.com/users/72187,"First of all, your calculations on the number of pairs of people are wrong. There are 100 000 000 people, that's ${10}^{8}$, which gives us $5 \times {10}^{15}$ pairs of people (using the formula you wrote).

The probability of two people buying the same set of objects is ${1 \over 10^{23}}^2$ - because the same set has to be picked twice.

At the end we would get $100 \times (5 \times 10^{15}) \times ({1 \over 10^{23}})^2 ≈ 5 \times (10^{17}) \times {1 \over 10^{46}} ≈ {5 \over 10^{29}} ≈ {1 \over 2\times10^{28}} ≈ {1 \over 10^{28}}$ (I dropped the 2.6 just to make the equation simpler)

The main question here is:


  ""If we search for pairs of people who have bought the same set of items, would we expect that any such people found were truly criminals?""


The answer is yes, because:


  ""The Bonferroni principle says that we may only detect terrorists by looking for events that are so rare that they are unlikely to occur in random data"" 


and our event is very unlikly to happen.

4541,4541,7195,The Acidity of the Hydrated Iron (III) Ion,"Why is $\ce{Fe(OH_2)_6^{3+}}$ fairly acidic? This iron has six water molecules coordinated to it. 

In other words, water itself is a very weak acid. But when water is coordinated to iron, it becomes more acidic. I can think of a few reasons; can you think of more? Also are my reasons valid? 

1) Induction. The negative charge generated through loss of the hydrogen proton is stabilized by the coordinated water molecules. Plus the center of the square planar molecule is greatly positively charged (and therefore can handle the negative charge, despite the fact that iron itself is actually electropositive rather than electronegative - at least in iron's ground state). 

2) Size of the ferric ion. The ferric ion is rather big (it is, after all, able to coordinate six water molecules, as opposed to only four for some other metal ions). So whatever positive charge it has after being ionized once is spread out over a large surface area and that makes entire compound relatively stable. 

3) Oxidation state of the central ferric ion - positive 3. This indicates a high degree of ionic character in the coordination bonds. Withdrawal of electron density from the water molecules makes the hydrogens even more positively charged and thus even more electrophilic.  

4) Positive charge density of the central ferric atom. Coulomb's law is in (significant) effect here. Positive and positive. Like charges repel. Kicking off a hydrogen proton - no problem. 


",Dissenter,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/users/5084,"When a water molecule coordinates to $\ce{Fe^3+}$, one non-bonded $sp^3$ hybrid orbital (with one of the 2 lone pairs) of oxygen overlaps with an empty $d$ or $p$ orbital of $\ce{Fe^3+}$. Electron density is transferred from oxygen to iron, and due to the electronegativity of oxygen, the polarization of the $\ce{O-H}$ bond in the water ligand is increased (more electron density is ""pulled"" from $\ce{H}$ towards $\ce{O}$). The hydrogens are more positively polarized than in a free (uncoordinated) water molecule, and this increases their electrophilic character and acidity to the point that they are readily abstracted by solvent (non-coordinated) $\ce{H2O}$ in aqueous solution:

$$\ce{Fe(H2O)6^3+ + H2O \rightleftharpoons  Fe(H2O)5(OH)^2+ + H3O+}$$

$$\ce{Fe(H2O)5(OH)^2+ + H2O \rightleftharpoons  Fe(H2O)4(OH)2^+ + H3O+}$$

The aqueous solution of $\ce{Fe^3+}$ aquo complexes is fairly acidic, wth a pH of up to 1.5 depending on iron concentration.

You have mentioned ion charge (oxidation state) and charge density (which is proportional to ion size) of the metal center as potential factors of influence. One can expect that with increased charge and/or charge density, the polarization of the water ligands also increases, and thus the aquo complex should be more acidic. This is true for many aquo complexes; however, there are also some deviations from this rule, like $\ce{Cr(H2O)6^2+}$ and $\ce{V(H2O)6^2+}$ (reference).

I am running the following function which takes in image and phrase (spaces will be removed so just text) as arguments, i have already been given all the import and preprocessing code, i just need to implement this function. I can only use getpixel, putpixel, load, and save. That is why coding this has been a hard task for me.

    for index,value in enumerate(phrase):

Edit:

Ok Thanks, i understood and now posting code but i am getting error for the if statement not sure why the if statement is not working, here is full code sorry for not adding it entirely before: 

from future import division  

letters, numbers, and punctation are dictionaries mapping (uppercase)

characters to Images representing that character

NOTE: There is no space character stored!

from imageproc import letters, numbers, punctuation, preProcess  

This is the function to implement

def InserttoImage(srcImage, phrase):
    pix = srcImage.load()
    for index,value in enumerate(phrase):
        if value in letters:
           pix[10+index, 15]  = letters[value]

        elif value in punctuation: 
           pix[10+index, 15]  = punctuation[value]
    srcImage.save()

This code is performed when this script is called from the command line via:

'python .py'

if name == 'main':
    srcImage, phrase = preProcess()
    InserttoImage(srcImage, phrase)  

Thanks, letter, numbers, and punctuation are dictionaries which see the key element and open the image (font).
But still there is an issue with pix[10+index, 15] as it is giving error:

1147,1147,1802,Why not have the gears inside the bottom bracket?,"Looking into an IGH it seems the biggest disadvantage is having a huge amount of rotating mass. I've seen one handmade bike where the IGH sits above the bracket, inside a carbon fibre shroud around the place some bikes have rear suspension. There are two chains, one driving the IGH and another to drive the rear wheel. 

Why not have an internally geared bottom bracket where the cranks drive the input shaft and the crank ring rotates at a ratio selectable by the gear lever? 

Then the rear wheel could have a single drive wheel driven by a chain or belt and a lightweight hub just solid enough to mount the spokes and disc. Then you could have mud-free gearing while reducing rotating mass even below what you have with a conventional cassette... and given that you have thrown out the bottom bracket the overall weight gain would be less.

604,604,946,Cyclic group of order $6$ defined by generators $a^2=b^3=a^{-1}b^{-1}ab=e$.,"
  The cyclic group of order $6$ is the group defined by the generators $a,b$ and relations $a^2=b^3=a^{-1}b^{-1}ab=e.$


For this problem I am assuming that it must be $a,b \neq e$. I will show the $a^ib^j$ are distinct for $i=0,1$ and $j=0,1,2$. If $i=0$, $b^0=e,b,b^2$ are distinct. We know order of $b$ is not $2$ as $b^3=e$ as the order of an element divides powers that make $b$ the identity, this would mean $2\mid 3$ a contradiction. For $i=1$,
$$ab^i=ab^k \rightarrow b^i=b^k \rightarrow i\equiv k \mod{3}$$
but as $0\leq i,k &lt; 3$, $i=k$ so $a,ab,ab^2$ are distinct.

So we have that $G \supseteq \{e,a,b,b^2,ab,ab^2\}.$ So
$$G=\left&lt;a,b\right&gt; =\{ a^{n_1}b^{n_2}\cdots a^{n_r}b^{n_{r+1}}\mid n_i \in \mathbb{Z}\}$$
and as $a^{-1}b^{-1}ab=e$, $ab=ba$ and so we can write $G$ as
$$G=\{a^nb^m \mid n,m \in \mathbb{Z}.$$
We then also have by $a^{-1}b^{-1}ab=e$ that
$$a^{-1}b=ba^{-1},\,a^{-1}b^{-1}=b^{-1}a^{-1},\,ab^{-1}=b^{-1}a$$
and so any
$$a^nb^m=a\cdots a\cdot b\cdots b =b^ma^n$$
as we can commute the elements to get $b^ma^n$ so $G$ is abelian. To show there are exactly $6$ elements, if we pick any $a^nb^m \in G$, we can assume that $0\leq n\leq 1$ and $0\leq m \leq 2$ and then this element is already accounted for above so
$$G=\{e,a,b,b^2,ab,ab^2\}.$$
As $G$ is a finite abelian group of order $6$, $G$ can be written uniquely up to permutation as a direct sum of $\mathbb{Z}_{p_i^{k_i}}$'s where the $p_i$ are prime but there is only one way to do this for $6=2\cdot3$ so this means
$$G\cong \mathbb{Z}_2\oplus\mathbb{Z}_3\cong\mathbb{Z}_6$$
as $\gcd(2,3)=1$.

I am just wondering of nicer ways to argue this in the case I would need to do this on an exam. Also if everything looks correct too.
",Frudrururu,https://math.stackexchange.com/users/43138,"Your arguments work just fine, but we can do a bit better.

Let's define $$G=\langle a,b\mid a^2=b^3=a^{-1}b^{-1}ab=e\rangle.$$

As you noted, $a^{-1}b^{-1}ab=e$ if and only if $ab=ba.$ Hence, $a$ and $b$ commute, and so since $G$ is generated by $a$ and $b,$ then it follows immediately that $G$ is an abelian group, and in particular $$G=\{a^mb^n\mid m,n\in\Bbb Z\}.$$ Since $a^2=e$ and $b^3=e,$ then we can conclude that $$G=\{e,a,b,ab,b^2,ab^2\}.$$

At this point, there are a few ways we can proceed:


Show that $e,a,b,ab,b^2,ab^2$ are distinct, then note that the abelian group of order $6$ is cyclic.
Show that $e,a,b,ab,b^2,ab^2$ are distinct, then apply Structure Theorem for Finite Abelian groups, as you did, together with the fact that $\gcd(2,3)=1,$ so that $G$ is cyclic.
Show that $e,a,b,ab,b^2,ab^2$ are distinct, then demonstrate an element of $G$ of order $6.$
Show that $H:=\langle a\rangle\cong\Bbb Z_2,$ $K:=\langle b\rangle\cong\Bbb Z_3,$ and that $H\cap K=\{e\},$ so since $H,K$ are normal subgroups of $G$ (since $G$ abelian) and $HK:=\{hk\mid h\in H,k\in K\}=G,$ then $G\cong H\times K.$ (Have you seen this result before?) Thus, $G\cong\Bbb Z_2\times\Bbb Z_3\cong\Bbb Z_6.$

That last is arguably the simplest. It suffices to show that $a\ne e,$ $b\ne e,$ $b^2\ne e,$ $a\ne b,$ and $a\ne b^2.$

440,440,684,Why do Football players prefer to use their family name?,"I read that in Western countries, people prefer their first name over their family name, that is why they put their first name first, in form first name + family name For example Wayne Rooney, Steven Gerrard, ...

2605,2605,4146,Ticketing/Project Management/Collaborative Software for Graphic Design,"I manage our company's in-house graphic design.  We have a lot of requests that are very simple (ie, ad-resizing, simple web banners, logo-adjustments, etc) and a number of requests that are complex and require a lot of back and forth (ie, brochures and magazines ranging from 3 to 200 pages, concept design for new ad campaigns, etc...)

Currently, we employ a very simple issue tracking system (which is technically for software development) for all requests. For the most part it does the job.  Users can write a description of the materials they need, upload attachments, leave comments, but because our company is growing in size and the amount of requests are steadily growing, I was looking for a more robust solution.

After doing a lot of research, I've found a number of new systems I could potentially upgrade to, however, everything I have found explains how their system is best suited for an IT/software development team.

So before upgrading to a newer, more robust project management system that is specifically geared toward software development/IT desktop support, I was wondering if anyone of knew of any ticketing/collaborative systems specifically geared toward graphic design?

Why was Benjen Stark on the Wall? Was there an explanation I have missed?

I appreciate, as a younger brother, he would have had less opportunity than Brandon (or Eddard), and may have been looking for adventure or honour, but the Wall, by the time he would have joined, was hardly at the height of its renown.

Joining the Black wouldn't be, I would have thought, a particularly obvious option for Benjen, if he was simply looking for a title or a role in life to fit the name of Stark.

It is widely believed that this was Eddard - but the only reason for this seems to be the Eddard/Ashara connection and the rumours of her being John Snow's mother. Such a thing would have been extremely out-of-character for Eddard and Brandon also seems unlikely as, at that point, he was both betrothed to Catelyn and in a tryst with the future Lady Dustin (though this does not rule him out altogether).

However, if we consider the only other character who knew the situation well - Barristan Selmy, who was in love with Ashara - he dismisses the notion of Ashara being John Snow's mother; saying her child was a stillborn girl - the grief over which drove Ashara to suicide. He also (as Meera did) avoids naming the father - referring to him simply as ""Stark"".

If it was not Eddard but Benjen who impregnated Ashara at Harrenhaal, this would provide a far greater reason for him to take the black - his daughter died at birth and the woman he loved killed herself with the grief of it.

Furthermore, if other theories (already noted in previous comments above) about John Snow's parentage are correct - and if Eddard knew of Benjen and Ashara's child - then this theory also explains why Eddard went to Starfall under the pretence of returning Arthur Dayne's sword (surely, given the circumstances, that could have waited a few weeks?) - he knew a Stark bastard was due to be born there and perhaps hoped to pass the infant Jon off as a twin or even replace Ashara's child with Jon.

",Mike,https://christianity.stackexchange.com/users/1743,"I must admit, I chuckled at This is the kind of question kids ask me in Sunday School.. Anyway...

First off, Revelations 19 has a wedding feast.


  Revelation 19:9 (NIV)
  9&nbsp;Then the angel said to me,   “Write this:   Blessed are those who are invited to the wedding supper of the Lamb!”   And he added, “These are the true words of God.” 


(Emphasis mine.)

You can't really have a feast without food or drink. There is also the promise of Jesus that He will not drink wine again until this very same feast.


  Matthew 26:29 (NLT)   
  
  29&nbsp;Mark my words—I will not drink wine again until the day I drink it new with you in my Father’s Kingdom.”
  
  Mark 14:25 (NLT)   
  
  25&nbsp;I tell you the truth, I will not drink wine again until the day I drink it new in the Kingdom of God.”
  
  Luke 22:18 (NLT)   
  
  18&nbsp;For I will not drink wine again until the Kingdom of God has come.”


This statement takes place immediately after Jesus offers wine and bread at the first Communion. Now, if there weren't any grapes in Heaven, could there be wine? Now, obviously, God could very easily simply produce wine on the spot, and a miracle should never be excluded from the set of possibilities.

Does Jesus eat in heaven? What reason do we think he didn't?","I must admit, I chuckled at This is the kind of question kids ask me in Sunday School.. Anyway...

First off, Revelations 19 has a wedding feast.


  Revelation 19:9 (NIV)
  9&nbsp;Then the angel said to me,   “Write this:   Blessed are those who are invited to the wedding supper of the Lamb!”   And he added, “These are the true words of God.” 


(Emphasis mine.)

You can't really have a feast without food or drink. There is also the promise of Jesus that He will not drink wine again until this very same feast.


  Matthew 26:29 (NLT)   
  
  29&nbsp;Mark my words—I will not drink wine again until the day I drink it new with you in my Father’s Kingdom.”
  
  Mark 14:25 (NLT)   
  
  25&nbsp;I tell you the truth, I will not drink wine again until the day I drink it new in the Kingdom of God.”
  
  Luke 22:18 (NLT)   
  
  18&nbsp;For I will not drink wine again until the Kingdom of God has come.”


This statement takes place immediately after Jesus offers wine and bread at the first Communion. Now, if there weren't any grapes in Heaven, could there be wine? Now, obviously, God could very easily simply produce wine on the spot, and a miracle should never be excluded from the set of possibilities.

Now to actually answer your real question: we can't really know. I know of no verse that talks about whether or not there is any food or drink being consumed in Heaven right now. That said, what is there to keep Jesus and other people already up there from enjoying the gift of eating that God gave them?

2571,2571,4092,Effective game mechanics for handling conflicts with spirits,"A very effective set piece can be conflict with the spirit world.  A nice example of the kind of thing I am thinking of is from the 1982 Conan film, where the wizard opens a gateway to the spirit world to get demons to revive Conan, and where Valeria fights incorporeal demons to save Conan (YouTube, from 6:45 into the clip to the end &amp; onto next clip).

RQ3 had nice mechanics for dealing with these situations, with shamans who can take characters to the other side through their fetch, spirit combat to handle attacks by hostile spirits, using magic points as an orthogonal measure of strength to hit points.  

AD&amp;D was pretty lousy for this kind of thing back in the day: its distinction between combat involving the incorporeal attribute or in the ethereal and astral realms didn't really work for setting up situations.  But newer D&amp;Ds seem to have better resources, though I've not seen this in action.

What good game mechanics are there for handling conflicts with spirits?

Postscript

The kind of thing game mechanics need, I think, to sustain interest in spirits and spirit combat are:


Spirits are immaterial and that means you have to do different sorts of things to influence them.  E.g., if the best way to deal with an ancient ghost is to chop it up with an axe, that'll spil that atmosphere a bit;
Likewise, spirits are potentially powerful adversaries.  Not very high-powered spells that can get rid of most spirits with a 65% chance of success detract from interest;
Characters can be experts in spirits, and it is good if the nature of those experts draws on resonant real-world and fictional atmospheric devices such as shamans, ancestor worship, fetches, and the like.  It's also good if characters regularly need the services of these figures.

2613,2613,4156,What to do about students who ask for help too often?,"For my writing courses, about 5% of students will come to me prior to deadlines asking for help with their paper. I see no problem advising students, as I often similarly came for help when I was an undergraduate. Recently, though, I found an increase in students who apparently just want to abuse this:


Students will bring me some plagiarized work, showing it to me early, as a sort of test if I will notice. It seems difficult to punish plagiarism when the paper is not yet submitted.
Students will bring in papers again and again, with little changes put in at each stage, hoping their minimal effort each time will be sufficient to reach their goal of a ""D"".


I've tried stopping students, but then they are angry when they see the ""F"" that they hoped I would help them get away from. While most of these students are probably just incredibly lazy, there is a chance that some among them are genuinely trying to improve, but just struggling a great deal, and I can't see it.

How might I go about blocking such abuses?
",Village,https://academia.stackexchange.com/users/600,"While there are some good answers here, I will just add a few thoughts from my own experiences.

If it was pass they stopped listening. Of course, this is quite unhealthy for their longer-term success.

I have since changed to not telling them what grade I would give them before they submit, partially because of JeffE's comment to this question. Now, I focus ONLY on showing the students how to judge their own papers. I explain that I will mark when they submit but if they want to understand how to mark their own papers, I will help them.

I do not check for plagiarism on drafts (though some students do ask me to). If I see something which looks like plagiarism, like the level of English goes from very poor to perfect, I do let the students know that this looks like plagiarism and, if it is, they should fix it with proper citation before submitting.

In short, focus on teaching them how to grade their own papers. This helps a lot if you provide a rubric. Do not tell them ""I will give you a  'D' if you submit this."" Instead, tell them ""Tell me what you think this paper deserves and explain to me why you believe that."" Then help them develop that skill.

There aren't traditional words, there are traditional senses. Compare:

  I love Firefly. Next to Twin Peaks it is my favourite programme.


I've deliberately picked a different ""transitional word"" to hopefully make it easier to see the point if you're perhaps over-thinking so.

In the first case here, next is indeed in a transitional sense—it serves to introduce the next sentence while also stating they are in a temporal order—and the comma makes sense.

In the second case next is not doing this transitional job, but telling us something about how the topic of discussion (Firefly) relates to another thing (Twin Peaks) in the writer's opinion. We don't want to separate it from the to; what would the now separated ""to Twin Peaks it is…"" even mean?

So, back to so.

So's transitional sense is ""used after a pause for thought to introduce a new topic, question or story."" In this sense you can remove it and not really lose much meaning, though might you lose impact. If you want your sentence to mean ""I am confident that …"" but with so serving this introductory role, then the comma might be a good idea for that reason. (It might also be a good idea to just cut it, but that's another matter).

Another sense of so is ""therefore"" or ""with the result that"". If you want so to say that the studies you mention in the previous sentence (along, perhaps, with earlier statements) is the reason why you have this confidence, then the comma is probably a bad idea.

I imagine you want the second of these two readings, and I'd therefore recommend that you don't use a comma.

3663,3663,5843,House rules to make the cloister less of a game winning tile in Carcassonne?,"In my experience, cloister tiles in Carcassonne are often ""too lucky"". If you draw a cloister tile in the beginning of the game, it will typically still require an investment of quite a bit of ""meeple"" time to obtain the full 9 points, which makes it a fair trade-off. However, after about half of the game, it's relatively likely that you can ""parachute"" a cloister tile in some spot and get 8 or 9 points immediately. This adds a lot of randomness to the game.

What house rules work well to diminish this effect?
",Erik P.,https://boardgames.stackexchange.com/users/30,"You could borrow the ""Abbey"" idea from the Abbyes and Mayors expansion.

Abbeys are special tiles (6 of them divided equally among all players) which you can play rather than drawing and playing a random tile. The abbey counts as a cloister for scoring and playing a meeple on, and has a solid edge, so that it ends a road, and walls off citys and farms that it borders. Abbeys can only be played in holes - spaces that have tiles on all four sides.

The effect of this is that areas that are prime ""gotcha"" cloister locations at end game are a little less likely as they either get Abbeys dropped into them, or players shy away from letting such places appear.

The RB3 Keyboard is not a full-sized keyboard.  If we do use a full-sized midi keyboard in Pro mode, can we/do we have to use the entire keyboard, as it's played in the actual song, or can we/do we have to stick to two octaves (like the RB3 Keyboard)?
The RB3 Keyboard can also function as a five-button peripheral in non-Pro mode.  Can we do the same with a normal midi keyboard?
I've read that the RB3 keyboard has velocity-sensitive keys.  Does RB3 take this into effect?  Will I lose some functionality if my midi keyboard isn't velocity-sensitive?  Does the expressions bar also add functionality?

",BlueRaja - Danny Pflughoeft,https://gaming.stackexchange.com/users/2578,"My qualifications: I've used both the RB3 keyboard and a Roland D-50 MIDI Synth with a MIDI adapter.


If you use a full-sized midi keyboard in Pro mode, you do NOT use the entire keyboard. RB3 ignores notes played outside the two octave range of the RB3 keyboard. The pro keys chart displayed is the same no matter what kind of keyboard you are using (unlike the pro guitar charts which I understand are different depending on whether you use a 17-fret Mustang or a 22-fret Squier).
A normal midi keyboard can also function as a five-button peripheral in non-Pro mode. The only thing missing are the color-coded tags over the C-D-E-F-G keys that the RB3 keyboard has, but since you shouldn't be looking at your hands anyway, that shouldn't matter ;)
I don't think RB3 does anything with the velocity-sensitive keys, so you should not lose any functionality if your midi keyboard isn't velocity-sensitive. This is the only answer I'm not 100% positive on (my D-50 has velocity-sensitive keys), but I'm pretty sure.
The expression bar on the RB3 keyboard is like the whammy bar on the 5-button guitar controllers - it alters the sound of the notes and when used on a held note with overdrive, it will add to your overdrive bar. My D-50 has a pitch bend joystick that the MIDI adapter converts to the same function.

To create a filer for a message that frequently is sent to you:


select or open a message you want to filter
Under the More pulldown select the command: Filter messages like these
You will then see the form open up with the FROM box filled in.
Google with then show you the messages that the filter has found.
Click create filter with this search. 
You can now specify if you want to:

Skip the Inbox (Archive it)
Apply the label:

4965,4965,7909,Seperation of drawing and logic in games,"I'm a developer that's just now starting to mess around with game development. I'm a .Net guy, so I've messed with XNA and am now playing around with Cocos2d for the iPhone. My question really is more general though. 

Let's say I'm building a simple Pong game. I'd have a Ball class and a Paddle class. Coming from the business world development, my first instinct is to not have any drawing or input handling code in either of these classes.

//pseudo code
class Ball
{
   Vector2D position;
   Vector2D velocity;
   Color color;
   void Move(){}
}


Nothing in the ball class handles input, or deals with drawing. I'd then have another class, my Game class, or my Scene.m (in Cocos2D) which would new up the Ball, and during the game loop, it would manipulate the ball as needed.

The thing is though, in many tutorials for both XNA and Cocos2D, I see a pattern like this:

//pseudo code
class Ball : SomeUpdatableComponent
{
   Vector2D position;
   Vector2D velocity;
   Color color;
   void Update(){}
   void Draw(){}
   void HandleInput(){}
}


My question is, is this right? Is this the pattern that people use in game development? It somehow goes against everything I'm used to, to have my Ball class do everything. Furthermore, in this second example, where my Ball knows how to move around, how would I handle collision detection with the Paddle? Would the Ball need to have knowledge of the Paddle? In my first example, the Game class would have references to both the Ball and the Paddle, and then ship both of those off to some CollisionDetection manager or something, but how do I deal with the complexity of various components, if each individual component does everything themselves? (I hope I'm making sense.....)

831,831,1325,Are Mintakans related to Vulcans?,"In TNG ""Who Watches the Watchers"" we learn about the Mintakans, who are described as ""proto-Vulcan humanoids"".  Does this mean that the Mintakans come from a common ancestor to the Vulcans, or does it mean that the two species have evolved coincidentally to share many of the same features? (Or not so coincidentally if you take into account that genetic-seeding by the super ancient humanoids.)

We have been shown many species that look completely like humans, and even entire planets that mirror Earth (TOS ""Miri"") and maybe some of those species could be considered ""proto-human humanoids"".

I don't think it has been defined how long Vulcans have had space travel, or if it's even possible the Vulcans evolved from some other species that had space travel earlier, and the Mintakans are some off-shoot of that species.  This could possibly be justified from what Spock says in TOS ""Return to Tomorrow"" where he seems to suggest in response to Sargon and the astrobiology doctor that there are unexplained issues with Vulcans evolving on the planet Vulcan, that they might have been colonized by Sargon's people instead.

Interesting reading:

Since Rombulas (and Remans) WERE once Vulcans they have a direct descent line from the planet Vulcan in the distant past.

4387,4387,6976,How can I fully automate the creation and configuration of a SharePoint virtual machine?,"I typically require multiple SharePoint virtual machines for development purposes.

5225,5225,8307,STFT - DFT size of the bins,"Having some trouble understanding this concept, really could do with some advice.

I want my STFT to have the following parameters: NFFT = 256 overlap/hop = 128

Now essentially, the algorithm will work as follows:

1) Split the signal into blocks of 256 


This will result in around 72*265:

2) For each of these blocks, calculate against the Hanning Window 

3) Create a ""slider"" that does an overlap of 128.. So, in theory it would 
   therefore be: `size = 256 + 128` 


Therefore, when I'm computing the DFT for each of the overlapped blocks, will my FFT remain at size 256 or will the size be 256 + 128 If this is the case, does each block in the resulting vector still have to be of size 256?

Thanks  

EDIT: 

This is now my result:



But, compare this to a spectrogram in matplotlib



Where am I actually going wrong? I cannot make any sense of this. 

I've looked bat through all the data, the blocks are correctly overlapping, Hanning window is being applied correctly.

Could it be to do with the fact I'm using a 1D DFT? I.e. 

std::vector&lt;complex&gt; FFT-&gt;transform(complex_vector[0...n], 256);

Is there any experimental technique to limit the number of 'solutions'?

So, we have a non-peturbative definition of M-theory and string theories on AdS Space through the AdS/.CFT correspondence. Now,  these are 10 or 11-dimensional.          To get rid of the extra 6 or 7 dimensions, you need to compactify it on a 6-dimensional or 7-dimensional manifold. 

A particularly convinient compactifications of 11-dimensional M-theory is on $G(2)$-holonomy manifolds.       Particularly convinient compactifications of 10-dimensional string theories, such as Type HE, are on $SU(3)$-holonomy Calabi-Yau manifolds.      Of course, it's not necessary; e.g. if the world happens to be something with $\mathcal N=2$ supersymmetry, as opposed to                           $\mathcal N=1$.             


  Why are there so many 'solutions'?  


Because there are lots of these manifolds!       


  I thought string theory was supposed to be finite, why do perturbative
  series still diverge?  


Uh... Yes. But it's renormaliable. And there are non-peturbative definitions in AdS spacetime.     


  Is there any experimental technique to limit the number of
  'solutions'?  Will experimental techniques be able to pinpoint a
  solution within present day string theorists' life      times too? If
  not, how long will it take before we can experimentally probe these
  things?


In principle, it's possible.    But in anyone's lifetime... Do you know how big $10^{500} $ is? % See this.   


  Are string theorists completely relaxed about these issues? Or are
  they in anguish?

3669,3669,5851,magento creates two customer sessions with one browser for the same guest?,"I'm using Magento 1.7.0.2.
And I have the Problem to access customer session data I set in different controllers. 
I found out, that magento generates two session files (in var/session/) when I load two different controllers of my own modules
where I set data to the “customer/session”!
So when I load content over the one controller, then i get the one customer session data from the first session file and when i load an cms page or the other controller I get the data of the other session file! How can that be?
I’m using the same browser all the time. Why does magento think that there are two different users and generates two different customer session files when i load a different controller??? Additional I don’t work at this time with logged in customers...it’s all the time the guest customer session.

Has anybody any idea? 

UPDATE:

I checked the difference between the using of the different sessions by logging the session id and the differences of my controller classes.
I found out that I used in one controller the “_construct” function to set some helper variables. And when I removed this usage magento uses the other “correct” session. with the _construct it used the other session id.
But I don’t know why.

",vsz,https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/14088,"Courtesy of the book Carl found we have an answer!



Consider the element of the liquid helium at a height $h$ above the fluid surface and distance $y$ from the wall. To raise that element above the fluid surface costs an energy $mgh$, but because there is a Van der Waals attraction between the helium atoms and the wall you get back an energy $E_{VdW}$. Dzyaloshinskii et al give the energy change per unit mass as:

$$ \Delta E = gh - \frac{\alpha}{y^n} $$

where $\alpha$ is constant giving the strength of the Van der Waals attraction and $n$ is in the range 3 - 4 depending on the film thickness. So it is energetically favourable to lift the fluid up the wall if the Van der Waals attraction outweighs the gravitational potential energy making $\Delta E$ negative. Since $y$ can be taken arbitrarily small (well, at least down to a few times the He atom size) $\Delta E$ will be negative for all heights $h$ and the film covers the whole wall.

The resulting equation for the film thickness $d$ as a function of height is given (without derivation) as:

$$ d \approx \left( \frac{\alpha}{gh} \right)^{1/n} $$

Since the liquid film will have a non-zero thickness at the top of the container wall it can flow over the wall and then down the outside. Even though the film thicknesses work out to be only a few tens of nanometres the zero viscosity of the superfluid helium allows an appreciable flow rate. Indeed, later in the book flow velocities of 30 cm/s are mentioned.

In principle this would apply to all fluids, however for normal fluids the flow rate in a film a few tens of nanometres thick would be infinitesimally small so the climbing is never observed.

A few comments of my own: I note that this derivation ignores the interfacial tensions of the helium/air, helium/wall and air/wall interfaces. I have no figures for what these would be for superfluid helium and possibly they are negligable. The predictions of the Dzyaloshinskii theory are claimed to agree well with experiment. Also you should note that one of the references provided by Carl challenges the above explanation, though without coming to any firm conclusions.

Also you should note that one of the references provided by Carl challenges the above explanation, though without coming to any firm conclusions.

5596,5596,8882,Server compromised - How do I find out what is sending mail,"A friend of mine has a few small businesses and hosts Wordpress-based sites for them on a dedicated host. The Wordpress installs were neglected for awhile and the host ended up getting compromised. There's now 100's of spam messages going out every second. What can I look at to determine what's generating the mail?

The only way I can get the spam to stop is to shutdown Postfix. We've had it off for a few days to prevent spamming, but this also means he can't send mail from his businesses addresses.

If I shutdown both apache and postfix, netstat shows no remote connections except my SSH login. If I then start postfix (but leave apache stopped), 100's of remote connections to port 25 immediately open. This leads me to believe that some process on the host is doing this, rather than something coming in through Wordpress/some rogue script that we missed in the clean-up. There were also IRC bots on here, but we've removed those, and netstat no longer shows any open connections to IRC.

When I look at ps axjf - all of the smtp processes roll up to /usr/libexec/postfix/master, which has a parent id of 1. This doesn't really give me an idea of where the mail is being generated.

Neither ps nor top show any suspicious processes (as far as I can tell).

What else can I look at to see what's creating/sending the mail? I can post the output of ps whatever_flags_you_want both with and without postfix running, if it will help.

Thanks.

I get the following in Zsh

tdA          
zsh: correct 'tdA' to 'tda' [nyae]?


How can you make Zsh not to suggest a fix for an alias?
",Léo Léopold Hertz 준영,https://serverfault.com/users/1944,"I've been using zsh for about 18 years now, and I must say I don't like the accepted solution. Here's why:

You need to figure out the source of the problem - determine why 'tda' is being offered as a correction option. What you have done is completely disabled spelling correction globally. This denies you some very nice functionality while trying to get rid of a tactical problem. It's like wanting to kill a fly in your house by setting off some dynamite just because you're too lazy to figure out where the fly swatter is: It may get rid of the problem, but you sacrifice a whole lot in return. :)

Until you can determine your zsh's current spell correction configuration, you should consider setting the value of the special shell variable $CORRECT_IGNORE to a value of 'tda'.

Here is the entry in the zsh man page:

   CORRECT_IGNORE
          If set, is treated as a pattern during spelling correction.  Any
          potential  correction  that matches the pattern is ignored.  For
          example, if the value is `_*' then completion functions  (which,
          by  convention,  have  names  beginning  with `_') will never be
          offered as spelling corrections.  The pattern does not apply the
          correction  of  file names, as applied by the CORRECT_ALL option
          (so with the example just given files beginning with `_' in  the
          current directory would still be completed).


This should help get you by until you can determine the source of where 'tda' is actually coming from. 

Also note that you can use the precommand modifier 'nocorrect' to disable spelling correction on a per-command basis. You could use this to do something a little hacky, but effective:

alias tdA=""nocorrect tda""
alias tda=""todo -a""


aliases are just tokens substituted into the command-line by zsh, and those substitutions are re-scanned for additional aliases. So the above should work.

Hopefully these alternatives give you a more selective approach to solving your problem, while still giving you the benefit of zsh's rich spelling correction features.

5595,5595,8881,No value for $TERM and no -T specified,"I recently upgraded (with apt-get dist-upgrade) my Kubuntu and Lubuntu Linux boxes, and now every time I log into one of these machines, I get this message:

tput: No value for $TERM and no -T specified


Here is a screenshot of the exact message:


This happened on both my Lubuntu machine and Kubuntu machine, and it wasn't a problem until after I upgraded; so I suspect that it was not user error.

How can I fix this?

UPDATE

I have tracked this down to my .bashrc file, which is getting called by my .profile file.  Though, the fact that my .bashrc file now runs when I do a GUI login whereas it didn't before I upgraded is a bit weird.  And no, I haven't modified my .bashrc file or my .profile recently.  Also, bash isn't my default shell.

The problem is that I am calling tput in my .bashrc file to set up variables for use in adding color to the prompt.  But at the (inappropriate) time when my .bashrc file now gets run, $TERM is not set.

fgRed=$(tput setaf 1)     ; fgGreen=$(tput setaf 2)  ; fgBlue=$(tput setaf 4)
fgMagenta=$(tput setaf 5) ; fgYellow=$(tput setaf 3) ; fgCyan=$(tput setaf 6)
fgWhite=$(tput setaf 7)   ; fgBlack=$(tput setaf 0)
bgRed=$(tput setab 1)     ; bgGreen=$(tput setab 2)  ; bgBlue=$(tput setab 4)
bgMagenta=$(tput setab 5) ; bgYellow=$(tput setab 3) ; bgCyan=$(tput setab 6)
bgWhite=$(tput setab 7)   ; bgBlack=$(tput setab 0)


Updated question: How should I fix this?  Should I set $TERM myself?  Or should I just not set these variables if $TERM is not set?

UPDATE 2

One solution I tried was to check whether $TERM was set. But this didn't seem to work; I still got the same error message.  Here's the code:

if [ ! ""$TERM"" = """" ]; then
  #Do stuff here
fi


So apparently $TERM was set, but tput still concluded it wasn't.

3514,3514,5604,Why do objects fall at the same acceleration?,"I read these two posts and now I am more confused.

Do heavier objects fall faster?

Don&#39;t heavier objects actually fall faster because they exert their own gravity?

I was going to ask: if mass is an objects tendency to resist acceleration then why do two objects of different masses fall to the Earth at the same acceleration?

Then I read those posts and it seems that even though it is very small, the more massive object falls faster. Okay I understand, both objects attract each other.

If two cars of different masses collide doesn't the car with less mass accelerate more even though both cars received the same Force. Then that implies you need more force to accelerate a large mass than to accelerate a small mass. Because that is how I see it, the Moon attracts the Earth with the same Force as the Earth attracts the Moon but the Earth accelerates less due to its larger mass.

So then how is mass an object's tendency to resist acceleration? I am aware of $F_1 = F_2 = GMm/r^2$. So should we not really be able to see the difference in acceleration when dropping a massive object?

  Vectorization graphics approach  




Folks,
Photoshop newbie here with what I think is a simple question, but clearly, I am not searching for the right keywords on Google.

I have a hand-sketched pattern that I have scanned into a (bitmap) image. It is a crisp black and white image. I would like for a way to get Photoshop (or Illustrator) to detect the edges and extract paths from it, thereby converting it into a vector graphic.

Is there a simple way to accomplish this?

Thanks.

",Greg Bray,https://english.stackexchange.com/users/9063,"Apparently the rule for attaching suffixes is as follows:


  If suffix begins with a vowel (a,e,i,o,u,y)

As in Example word: cardiogram

208,208,332,"Superlatives with ""the""","What is the rule regarding using the with superlatives? For example:


  
  John is the fastest among his friends.
  John is fastest among his friends.
  


Both appear to be correct.   I have seen both formats in a variety of places.
",BVDL,https://english.stackexchange.com/users/10006,"Both are indeed correct. An article is only necessary in the superlative (or comparative) if the adjective is attributive (i.e. is in the same phrase as the noun it is describing).

Consider the following examples:


  
  Example #1:
  
  John is the fastest boy.
  *John is fastest boy.
  
  Example #2
  
  John is the fastest among his friends.
  John is fastest among his friends.
  
  


As is shown in the examples above, omitting the in #1 causes it to become ungrammatical, as the superlative fastest is in the same phrase as its noun boy. In #2, however, the may be freely omitted as it is not attributive.

Some English superlatives, however, use the adverb most, which can cause some amount of confusion. Consider the following examples:


  
  Mary is the most beautiful.
  Mary is most beautiful.
  Mary is a most beautiful woman.
  


All three of these examples are grammatical and show the overlap of an adverbial intensification with the superlative. With the definite article the, it can only be a superlative, but with the indefinite article a it can only be interpreted adverbially (i.e. essentially the same as ""very beautiful""). Both of these forms, however, allow omission of the article, and so the meaning of #2 is left ambiguous.

Note that there is a third form which is related to the superlative known as the elative. While it is not a separate inflection, it can be shown to exist in constructions such as the following:


  
  It is with the greatest pleasure [...]
  


This sentence is generally understood not to mean with a pleasure greater than any other, but rather something more akin to with extreme pleasure.

The attic space directly above the garage has no insulation and the exterior wall is just cinderblock with plaster on the outside of house.

This racks up the electricity bill as both the ac/heater and freezer needs to compensate for the large temperature difference. Also the garage walls that are part of the interior of house are not insulated, so that breaks the buildings insulation envelope further.

2332,2332,3716,The Probability of Catching Criminals,"I have been struggling with the following question and would greatly appreciate any help  :)


  Suppose we have information about the supermarket purchases of 100 million people. Each person goes to the supermarket 100 times in a year and buys 10 of the 1000 items that the supermarket sells. We believe that a pair of criminals will buy exactly the same set of 10 items at some time during the year. If we search for pairs of people who have bought the same set of items, would we expect that any such people found were truly criminals? Assume our hypothesis to be that a pair of criminals will surely buy a set of 10 items in common at some time during the year. 


This is meant to be an illustration of Bonferroni's principle. Suppose there are no criminals and that everyone behaves at random. Would we find any pairs of people who appear to be criminals?

We must initially find the expected number of pairs who buy the same 10 items per year. I'm not sure whether I do this correctly...

Here is how I've been going about solving it:

Number of possible pairs of people: $\binom{10^6}{2} = \frac{10^{12}}{2} = 5 \times 10^{11}$, using the fact that $\binom{n}{2} \approx \frac{n^2}{2}$, when $n$ is large.

Number of possible 10-item selections: $\binom{10^3}{10} \approx 2.6 \times 10^{23}$

Probability of a customer buying 10 particular items at a point in time:
$\frac{1}{2.6 \times 10^{23}}$

Probability of a customer buying 10 particular items at least once over the course of 100 periods in time: $\frac{100}{2.6 \times 10^{23}}$

Probability of a pair buying exactly the same 10 items (both at least once) over the course of 100 periods in time: $(\frac{100}{2.6 \times 10^{23}})^2 = (\frac{1}{2.6 \times 10^{21}})^2 = \frac{1}{6.76 \times 10^{42}}$

The expected number of pairs who buy the same 10 items per year is thus:

$ 5 \times 10^{11} \times \frac{1}{6.76 \times 10^{42}} = \frac{5}{6.75 \times 10^{31}}$

Because the above number is so low if we do find a pair buying the same 10 items then, under our hypothesis, they are likely to be criminals and not a false positive case. 

I am just wondering whether my solution to the above is correct?

$$\frac{1}{\binom{1000}{10}}.$$

For $N = 10^6$ people, and over $T = 100$ time units, the number of pairs of people is $T \binom{N}{2} = 100 \binom{10^6}{2}$.

So the expected number of occurrences of a pair of people buying the same set of items at the same time is

Fullscreenr

VideoBox


my custom code is just to change css style of items in menu(I'll post that code aswell).

My issue is that Fullscreenr and ScrollTo were working fine but when I want to add VideoBox the video popup doesn't want to work all it does is redirect to the youtube page. When I inspect the page(Chrome) it shows this error:

3261,3261,5199,God the Father's possession of a body of flesh and bones,"There is a belief out there that God the Father has always possessed a body of flesh and bones. Some of the proponents of this belief don't find it contradictory to John 4:24 (""God is a Spirit"") as the verse may be referring only to one part of God without limiting God to being only that one part - just like, for example, in 1 Pet 3:20 (""eight souls were saved by water"") Peter called some humans ""souls"", but he didn't mean by that that they didn't posses bodies.

The example of Jesus after His resurrection, Who, while possessing a body of flesh and bones, still retains all the qualities that are usually ascribed only to God, for example, His omnipresence, could go along with this belief. 

I wonder if Biblical hermeneutics, namely the hermeneutics of the Old Testament, allows for this belief. If not, please, point out those places that speak against the validity of this belief.
",brilliant,https://christianity.stackexchange.com/users/234,"Your question is worded a little tricky, but I think you're saying: John 4:24 says that God is a spirit, and you are saying that Mormons respond by saying that it only refers to one part of God (one part is the spirit and the other part is the body), since Mormons believe God has a body. Then you cite 1 Peter as an example.

Not to throw your example a little bit, but Mormons believe that


  15 ... the spirit and the body are the soul of man.(Doctrine and Covenants 88:15)


So, to answer your question:


  How do / Do Mormons reconcile God the Father's omnipresence with his corporeal / fleshy form?


Yes, Mormon doctrine does reconcile it, and it's quite simple:


The body houses the spirit.
God has a perfect, immortal, and glorified body which houses His spirit.
God is not, as an actual being, omnipresent. For example, Jesus couldn't visit the Nephites and other of God's children at the same time:



  1 And verily, verily, I say unto you that I have aother sheep, which
  are not of this land, neither of the land of Jerusalem, neither in any
  parts of that land round about whither I have been to minister.
  
  2 For they of whom I speak are they who have not as yet heard my
  voice; neither have I at any time manifested myself unto them.
  
  3 But I have received a commandment of the Father that I shall go
  unto them, and that they shall hear my voice, and shall be numbered
  among my sheep, that there may be one fold and one shepherd; therefore
  I go to show myself unto them.
  
  4 And I command you that ye shall write these sayings after I am

5903,5903,9349,Equivalent of Java 1.6 @Override for interfaces in C#,"This question gives the answer that Java's @Override has the C# equivalent of the override keyword on methods. However, since Java 1.6 the @Override annotation can be applied to interfaces also.

The practical use for this is that in Java you get compile errors when a class claims it implements an interface method when it no longer does (e.g. if the interface method is removed). Is there equivalent functionality in C#?

Some code examples:

Java:

public interface A {
  public void foo();
  // public void bar(); // Removed method.
}

public class B implements A {
  @Override public void foo();
  @Override public void bar(); // Compile error
}


C#:

public interface IA {
  void Foo();
  // void Bar(); // Removed method.
}

public class B : A {
  public override void Foo(); // Doesn't compile as not 'overriding' method
  public void Bar(); // Compiles, but no longer implements interface method
}

print render($block['content']['#content']);
?&gt;


However, all what is printed out are the words ""Array"".
(I have enabled the PHP input filter for the body field).

Note: in the posted code, I have also tried substituting 'views' with various items such as ""block"". I have used 'handy_tips-block_1' as the ID, because that is what is displayed on the configuration link of the block administration page.

3550,3550,5662,How to remember 10 last read articles with timestamp in session for a user in Codeigniter?,"I would like to make a PHP if condition code that will check if the last 10 articles or 10 minutes from the article reading by the user have already elapsed.

E.g. 

A user open a page with id = 235 (this id value is in the url localhost/article/235 )

and this id value will be saved in session with a current timestamp and maybe his IP address

Then he read another article and the same will happen.

I need to remember the clicked stuff for another ten clicks and then reset that only for the first row. E.g. after the 10th click the id and timestamp will not became 11th row but will replace the 1st row in the list.

The php condition in CodeIgniter will then check these values and will update the article hit counter value in the articles table and column counter like this:   

   $this-&gt;db-&gt;where('id', $id);
   $this-&gt;db-&gt;set('counter', 'counter+1', FALSE);
   $this-&gt;db-&gt;update('articles');


But before calling this code I need to make this check from the session?

How to do that?

I think storing e.g. 10 entries in the session with timestamps per user will be enough.

Just don't save the same page in the session twice.

And the condition will check the current timestamp with the saved one and if it is more than e.g. 10 minutes or the user have read/clicked another 10 articles it will allow the update counter php code.

I don't need to have this bulletproof. Just to disable the increment using browser's refresh button. 

So, if he wants to increment the counter he will need to wait ten minutes or read another 10 articles ;)

362,362,572,"""Hirable"" or ""hireable""","What is the correct adjective form of the word hire? I have seen references to both hireable and hirable. 

I checked using Google's Ngram viewer book search and it appears that both have been in use since the 1800s with hirable becoming a bit more popular in the past decade or so:


",Greg Bray,https://english.stackexchange.com/users/9063,"This is starting to become a bit of a hoary old chestnut. Since OP has already established that both forms are and have been in widespread use for some time, what does it mean to ask ""which is correct""?

In this particular case, although the NGram doesn't really make it clear, hirable really is becoming increasingly common. So by one standard, that's the spelling of the future, and is therefore arguably 'more correct'.

On the other hand, hireable was clearly the more prevalent form in the past - certainly in various linguistic subsets (in fact, it's still the preferred British usage, though that is changing even as I write). So arguably few people would seriously criticise anyone for using a more 'traditional' form.

In short, I think this question steers dangerously close to breaching FAQ guidelines which specify that questions should preferably admit of a single clear-cut answer which most competent speakers can agree on.

simulate this circuit &ndash; Schematic created using CircuitLab

I turn on S2 and shut off S1, then after a while, I turn on S1 and shut off S2. At that point I think I can redraw the circuit like this:







simulate this circuit

But if I do that, I think the current through the switch would then be zero? And then the switch would be considered ""off?"" Or maybe I could arbitrarily define the current through the switch as being from either the left or right hand side circuits? But that seems to be not possible because originally the switch was shared between both of the circuits.

Can someone figure out what is wrong with my reasoning? What should the current through the circuit be in the ""on"" position?

944,944,1494,FlotChart - Showing the distribution on hourly basis regardless of timestamp,"I would like to have a flotchart that depicts the distribution of all data (x axis represents the values from 0 to 10, y axis for hour only starting from 7am to 7pm).

I could not figure out how I should set the configuration of flotchart in this regard. 

Here is the json sample of my Dataset : 

[1409558400000, 7.45],[1409562000000, 5.71], [1409565600000, 7.50], [1409569200000, 7.63], [1409576400000, 3.14],

[1409731200000, 7.45],[1409734800000, 5.71], [1409738400000, 7.50], [1409742000000, 7.63], [1409749200000, 3.14]]
;  


And here is the code for flotchart; The problem with this is that it sorts all the series based on their timestamps. I do not want that.
I would like them to fit in based on their ""hour"" parameter only.

Anyone knows if only hour on the x-axis without sorting the data series  is possible with flotchart ?

Is that possible?
",rugbert,https://wordpress.stackexchange.com/users/19536,"This not a complete and ready-made answer, but the below should get you started.

First thing to note is, deleting and modifying are different functionalities, so different functions and hooks are relevant to it. Namely we are talking about wp_delete_term() - source and wp_update_term() - source - regarding the functions.

So lets take a look at wp_delete_term(), you have to at least consider two hooks: edit_term_taxonomies and delete_term_taxonomy. They are both relevant because of the bulk action and because of the handling of hierarchical taxonomies.

Below some exemplary code how to approach this. I've tried to explain the most important things inside the code. The rest you have to read up on yourself.

First the edit_term_taxonomies hook:

add_action(
    'edit_term_taxonomies',
    'wpse160191_top_level_lock_down_edit_term_taxonomies',
    10,
    1
);
function wpse160191_top_level_lock_down_edit_term_taxonomies(
    $edit_tt_ids
) {
    $screen_obj = get_current_screen();
    $base = $screen_obj-&gt;base;
    $taxonomy = $screen_obj-&gt;taxonomy;

    if(
        // these are the conditions we are checking against
        // is this a tag edit page
        $base == 'edit-tags'
        // we want this only for a specific taxonomy
        &amp;&amp; $taxonomy == 'category'
        // not super and/or admin
        &amp;&amp; ! current_user_can( 'manage_options' )
        // a least an editor
        &amp;&amp; current_user_can( 'manage_categories' )
    ) {

        // these are the terms up for deletion
        $terms_queue_for_deletion = $_POST['delete_tags'];
        $term_parents_ids = array();
        // we need information if or not one of the terms is a top level one
        foreach ( $terms_queue_for_deletion as $term_id ) {
            $term_obj = get_term_by( 'id', $term_id, 'category' );
            $term_parent = $term_obj-&gt;parent;
            $term_parents_ids[] = $term_parent;
        }

        if( empty( $edit_tt_ids ) ) {
            return;
        }

        if( ! empty( $edit_tt_ids ) ) {
            if ( in_array( 0, $term_parents_ids ) ) {
                $msg = new WP_Error(
                'parent_terms_are_forever',
                __('Sorry, you are not allowed to delete top level terms.')
                );
                wp_die( $msg );
            } else {
                return;
            }
        }
    }
}


Second the delete_term_taxonomy hook:

add_action(
    'delete_term_taxonomy',
    'wpse160191_top_level_lock_down_delete_term_taxonomy',
    10,
    1
);
function wpse160191_top_level_lock_down_delete_term_taxonomy(
    $tt_id
) {

    $screen_obj = get_current_screen();
    $base = $screen_obj-&gt;base;
    $taxonomy = $screen_obj-&gt;taxonomy;

    if (
        // these are the conditions we are checking against
        // is this a tag edit page
        $base == 'edit-tags'
        // we want this only for a specific taxonomy
        &amp;&amp; $taxonomy == 'category'
        // not super and/or admin
        &amp;&amp; ! current_user_can( 'manage_options' )
        // a least an editor
        &amp;&amp; current_user_can( 'manage_categories' )
    ) {
        $term_obj = get_term_by( 'term_taxonomy_id', $tt_id, 'category' );
        $parent_id = $term_obj-&gt;parent;
        if (
            // this applies only to top level terms
            $parent_id == 0
        ) {
            $msg = new WP_Error(
                'parent_terms_are_forever',
                __('s:Sorry, you are not allowed to delete top level terms.')
            );
            wp_die( $msg );
        }
    }
}


As mentioned above, it gets a bit more complicated, mainly because of the AJAX actions. If you are thinking about doing this with the well known and simple check:

if ( defined('DOING_AJAX') &amp;&amp; DOING_AJAX ) {
    // code
}


I can tell you right now, that I'm pretty certain it won't be sufficient enough. Mostly because you won't be able to do all the checks you need. If you are fine with just disabling or, to be exact, removing the link to the AJAX action, you can do it somewhat like this:

add_action(
    'admin_head' ,
    'wpse160191_remove_ajax_delete_link'
);
function wpse160191_remove_ajax_delete_link() {
    $screen_obj = get_current_screen();
    $base = $screen_obj-&gt;base;
    $taxonomy = $screen_obj-&gt;taxonomy;

    if(
        // lets just remove the link on that one page and not everywhere
        $base == 'edit-tags'
        &amp;&amp; $taxonomy == 'category'
    ) {
    ?&gt;
        &lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;
            jQuery(document).ready(function($) {
                var element = 'span.delete';
                $(element).each(function(){
                    $(element).css('opacity', '0');
                    $(element).css('pointer-events', 'none');
                    $(element).remove();
                });
            });
        &lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;?php
    }
}


Of course you shouldn't do it inline and so on, but you can optimize yourself. This of course is not very satisfying, because we just removed the functionality.

One way I imagine to deal with the AJAX action would be to make use of debug_backtrace(). This would offer a way to determine and handle the AJAX action correctly. It could be implemented into the above shown code. A caveat of course is that debug_backtrace() is performance-wise expensive and in a larger scale surely not recommendable.
Another way would be to implement your own AJAX action as replacement for wp_ajax_delete_tag(), but to do so you have to additionally either have to extend the WP_Terms_List_Table or use some hooks in there to achieve this. Not exactly sure at the moment, so you have to inspect that further yourself.

The procedure for wp_update_term() and disallowing updating/modifying is analogous to the above shown. With the same considerations concerning the AJAX part, especially because of the inline quick edit possibility. 



At first I totally misread the question and gave this as an answer.
Keeping it because it might be useful to others.

What you can do is hooking into the pre_insert_term to do the checks needed.

Code:

add_action( 'pre_insert_term', 'wpse160191_restrict_top_level_term_creation', 10, 2 );
function wpse160191_restrict_top_level_term_creation( $term, $taxonomy ) {
    if( 
        // these are the conditions we are checking against
        // we want this only for a specific taxonomy
        $taxonomy == 'topics'
        // a value of 0 or -1 does indicate the top level
        &amp;&amp; $_POST[ 'parent' ] &lt;= '0'
        // not super and/or admin
        &amp;&amp; ! current_user_can( 'manage_options' )
        // a least an editor
        &amp;&amp; current_user_can( 'manage_categories' )
    ) {
        // the user is an editor and not allowed to add parent terms
        // so return a friendly message so the user at least knows 
        return new WP_Error(
            'parent_terms_not_allowed_for_editors',
            __('Sorry, you are not allowed to add parent terms.')
        );
    } else {
        // a super and/or admin, s|he is allowed to do what s|he wants
        return $term;
    }
}


The pre_insert_term hook is part of the wp_insert_term() function.


Some Notes:


The parent value of the $args is 0, when no parent is selected. But we have no access to those inside the action, the form does return the value of -1 for $_POST[ 'parent' ] if »None« is selected. So &lt;= '0' should work in any case.  
We are not passing the user role to the current_user_can() function, because that is just wrong - although you see it a lot, it still is bad. Instead capabilities are used to determine, which kind of user we are dealing with.

Of course you shouldn't do it inline and so on, but you can optimize yourself. This of course is not very satisfying, because we just removed the functionality.

One way I imagine to deal with the AJAX action would be to make use of debug_backtrace(). This would offer a way to determine and handle the AJAX action correctly. It could be implemented into the above shown code. A caveat of course is that debug_backtrace() is performance-wise expensive and in a larger scale surely not recommendable.
Another way would be to implement your own AJAX action as replacement for wp_ajax_delete_tag(), but to do so you have to additionally either have to extend the WP_Terms_List_Table or use some hooks in there to achieve this. Not exactly sure at the moment, so you have to inspect that further yourself.

The procedure for wp_update_term() and disallowing updating/modifying is analogous to the above shown. With the same considerations concerning the AJAX part, especially because of the inline quick edit possibility. 



At first I totally misread the question and gave this as an answer.
Keeping it because it might be useful to others.

What you can do is hooking into the pre_insert_term to do the checks needed.

Code:

add_action( 'pre_insert_term', 'wpse160191_restrict_top_level_term_creation', 10, 2 );
function wpse160191_restrict_top_level_term_creation( $term, $taxonomy ) {
    if( 
        // these are the conditions we are checking against
        // we want this only for a specific taxonomy
        $taxonomy == 'topics'
        // a value of 0 or -1 does indicate the top level
        &amp;&amp; $_POST[ 'parent' ] &lt;= '0'
        // not super and/or admin
        &amp;&amp; ! current_user_can( 'manage_options' )
        // a least an editor
        &amp;&amp; current_user_can( 'manage_categories' )
    ) {
        // the user is an editor and not allowed to add parent terms
        // so return a friendly message so the user at least knows 
        return new WP_Error(
            'parent_terms_not_allowed_for_editors',
            __('Sorry, you are not allowed to add parent terms.')
        );
    } else {
        // a super and/or admin, s|he is allowed to do what s|he wants
        return $term;
    }
}


The pre_insert_term hook is part of the wp_insert_term() function.


Some Notes:


The parent value of the $args is 0, when no parent is selected. But we have no access to those inside the action, the form does return the value of -1 for $_POST[ 'parent' ] if »None« is selected. So &lt;= '0' should work in any case.  
We are not passing the user role to the current_user_can() function, because that is just wrong - although you see it a lot, it still is bad. Instead capabilities are used to determine, which kind of user we are dealing with.

4268,4268,6805,How to remember 10 last read articles with timestamp in session for a user in Codeigniter?,"I would like to make a PHP if condition code that will check if the last 10 articles or 10 minutes from the article reading by the user have already elapsed.

E.g. 

A user open a page with id = 235 (this id value is in the url localhost/article/235 )

and this id value will be saved in session with a current timestamp and maybe his IP address

Then he read another article and the same will happen.

I need to remember the clicked stuff for another ten clicks and then reset that only for the first row. E.g. after the 10th click the id and timestamp will not became 11th row but will replace the 1st row in the list.

The php condition in CodeIgniter will then check these values and will update the article hit counter value in the articles table and column counter like this:   

   $this-&gt;db-&gt;where('id', $id);
   $this-&gt;db-&gt;set('counter', 'counter+1', FALSE);
   $this-&gt;db-&gt;update('articles');


But before calling this code I need to make this check from the session?

How to do that?

I think storing e.g. 10 entries in the session with timestamps per user will be enough.

Just don't save the same page in the session twice.

And the condition will check the current timestamp with the saved one and if it is more than e.g. 10 minutes or the user have read/clicked another 10 articles it will allow the update counter php code.

I don't need to have this bulletproof. Just to disable the increment using browser's refresh button. 

So, if he wants to increment the counter he will need to wait ten minutes or read another 10 articles ;)

5253,5253,8352,Dealing with digital circuits and their associated switching speed?,"When designing a digital one-minute counting circuit I came across a difficult problem. 

Basically, I designed the circuit to drive the (normally HIGH) clock of the 10s slot low if the 1s slot's current state was 9 (actually, just if the first and last bits are HIGH -> 1001)

The devices I am using are positive edge, so when the 1s slot returns to zero the condition is no longer satisfied - therefore the clock returns to a HIGH state and increments the 10s slot.

The problem is that I was getting double clock problems(7->8 transition and the designed clock mechanism).   

It turns out that there was just enough delay in the switching between 7 -> 8 (0111 -> 1000) that the first/last bit HIGH condition is satisfied:

i.e., some combination occurs in the transition period to register a logical HIGH at the output

1001 1011 1101 1111

The temporary solution to the problem I came up with was to actually keep the clock for the 10s slot LOW until the condition where the 1s slot equals 0 (0000) is satisfied(So, essentially clock WHEN we get to the state as opposed to before). However, this solution requires too many gates (a 4-input NOR minimum). My previous design was actually fed from another part in the design that is already present, so it didn't require any additional circuitry. 

Any ideas on a more efficient solution?  




The IC's used in this design are the 74LS47 (7Segment decoder) and the 74LS163 (4-bit binary counter). The pull-down resistor inclusion is a mechanism to set the counters to 00 and hold while the switch is closed.

  Why does rabies cause hydrophobia? 
  
  Agony, Hydrophobia and viruses in the light of evolutionary principles


Has hydrophobia been found outside of rabies?

I have only seen it being mentioned as a symptom of rabies.
",user3306356,https://biology.stackexchange.com/users/6818,"Hydrophobia is mostly attributed to rabies, most of the sources refer rabies as hydrophobia. Technically Hydrophobia is the intense fear of water.




  Hydrophobia is an intense, irrational fear of water that can be commonly diagnosed at childhood and should be treated as soon as possible. Certain types of hydrophobia may also appear in later stages of contracting rabies, which would require treatment on an immediate basis.


Also the Wikipedia link for Rabies states that


  Signs and symptoms may soon expand to slight or partial paralysis, anxiety, insomnia, confusion, agitation, abnormal behavior, paranoia, terror, and hallucinations, progressing to delirium. The person may have hydrophobia.


So rabies and hydrophobia are distinct and hydrophobia is a symptom of rabies.


  Hydrophobia may, however, more readly be confronted with hysteria, acute mania and tetanus.


Hydrophobia is incidental to other diseases, it can be observed, occassionally, in tetanus,hysteria,cynanche,tonsillaris,tracheitis and certain inflammations in stomach. Tetanus is strongly believed to cause intense hydrophobia conditions.How ever, there is always a belief of hydrophobia linked with rabies.


  The pathology of Hydrophobia and Tetanus is found to have great similarities and there is a great similarity in the distribution of lesion in the central nervous system as well as a certain analogy in the kind of lesion. The special localization of symptoms of both disease, in the tongue,throat and neck was associated with the special prevalence of the lesions in the medulla oblongata and especially in the neighborhood of the nuclei in the fourth ventricle etc.

Technically Hydrophobia is the intense fear of water.




  Hydrophobia is an intense, irrational fear of water that can be commonly diagnosed at childhood and should be treated as soon as possible. Certain types of hydrophobia may also appear in later stages of contracting rabies, which would require treatment on an immediate basis.


Also the Wikipedia link for Rabies states that


  Signs and symptoms may soon expand to slight or partial paralysis, anxiety, insomnia, confusion, agitation, abnormal behavior, paranoia, terror, and hallucinations, progressing to delirium. The person may have hydrophobia.


So rabies and hydrophobia are distinct and hydrophobia is a symptom of rabies.


  Hydrophobia may, however, more readly be confronted with hysteria, acute mania and tetanus.


Hydrophobia is incidental to other diseases, it can be observed, occassionally, in tetanus,hysteria,cynanche,tonsillaris,tracheitis and certain inflammations in stomach. Tetanus is strongly believed to cause intense hydrophobia conditions.How ever, there is always a belief of hydrophobia linked with rabies.

4919,4919,7831,Is there a name for the number of values a variable can take?,"For example, a bit or a boolean can be either 0 or 1 so the number 2 is associated with it. Similarly, for a byte which is 8 bits, the maximum number of different assignments would be 2^8.

Is there a name for this number?

When we pass everything through our system that has ECMAScript, Java and MySQL, then a boolean does not have only two possible assignments. For instance, a false boolean gets saved as a 0 and the boxed value could be null so a boolean suddenly can get true, false, 0, 1, null or even undefined or &lt;missing&gt;.

I think it could get problematic in tests to guarantee that the values are not inconsistent. For instance, a value boolean locked could become null and then when a script or a layout template evaluates it then it will evaluate to false somewhere if the real value was null and similar problems.

So why don't we always assert that a boolean has the same number of possible values (2 values) and similarly for other types?

There is a mathematical term named ""arity"" that is something similar but not exactly, and statistics and probability theory also has the concept of ""event space"" that would be almost exactly what I mean. For instance, the event space for a boolean would be the set {0,1} which has cardinality 2 and that cardinality doesn't get preserved throughout the system, especially when data is passed as polyglots and/or serialized (json, jsonp, xml, yaml).
",Niklas Rosencrantz,https://programmers.stackexchange.com/users/12893,"I would call it cardinality (and indeed I have used it in that sense). It is strictly the cardinality of the set of all values a variable can take.

Edit: for example, a 16-bit integer can take exactly 65536 values. The cardinality of the set of all values that the integer can take is 655536.

Once you start to consider variables that have a range of valid values and also a range of invalid values (like a boolean with a bitwise value of 17), then you have to extend the concept somewhat, but you can still describe those values with set notation and the concept of cardinality still applies.

Edit: Yes, this is the mathematical set, not programming Set. If you were to apply the concept to the C# type short and derive the type short?, this would not have 65537 values, represented by the union of the set of 65536 values mentioned previously and one additional value, null.

3172,3172,5052,How to remember 10 last read articles with timestamp in session for a user in Codeigniter?,"I would like to make a PHP if condition code that will check if the last 10 articles or 10 minutes from the article reading by the user have already elapsed.

E.g. 

A user open a page with id = 235 (this id value is in the url localhost/article/235 )

and this id value will be saved in session with a current timestamp and maybe his IP address

Then he read another article and the same will happen.

I need to remember the clicked stuff for another ten clicks and then reset that only for the first row. E.g. after the 10th click the id and timestamp will not became 11th row but will replace the 1st row in the list.

The php condition in CodeIgniter will then check these values and will update the article hit counter value in the articles table and column counter like this:   

   $this-&gt;db-&gt;where('id', $id);
   $this-&gt;db-&gt;set('counter', 'counter+1', FALSE);
   $this-&gt;db-&gt;update('articles');


But before calling this code I need to make this check from the session?

How to do that?

I think storing e.g. 10 entries in the session with timestamps per user will be enough.

Just don't save the same page in the session twice.

And the condition will check the current timestamp with the saved one and if it is more than e.g. 10 minutes or the user have read/clicked another 10 articles it will allow the update counter php code.

I don't need to have this bulletproof. Just to disable the increment using browser's refresh button. 

So, if he wants to increment the counter he will need to wait ten minutes or read another 10 articles ;)

How can I access the first value from DATETIME_INPUT_FORMATS in my application?

The DATETIME_INPUT_FORMATS variable for german should be '%d.%m.%Y', whereas for english should be '%Y-%m-%d'. I want to use the values from the formats.py files depending on the language.    

I followed the Django documentation for how to use the FORMAT_MODULE_PATH variable, but I don't get the expected results.

I change the browser's language from English to German, and back and nothing happens with the date format. It is always '%Y-%m-%d'. The displayed date format is the value of settings.DATE_INPUT_FORMATS[0].

5418,5418,8603,Twisted pair cable twists and unwanted signals issue,"I am confused about one point I have read the following paragraph from the networking book.
“the twists in the twisted pair cable are used to avoid the unwanted signals. For example one twist, one wire is closer to the noise source and the other is farther; in the next twist the reverse is true. Twisting makes its probable that both wires are equally affected by the unwanted signal. This means that the receiver which calculate the difference between the two receives no unwanted signal.”

Now ok I understood the purpose of twists but I am confused about how receiver will calculate the difference when it will receive the signal?. How unwanted signal will be eliminated ? 
Another thing that I want to make clear is ,  I am beginner please provide such an answer that can be understood.

  COMMENT:  (None)

We ran the DBCC TRACEON (1204) command and have watched the log's but it's not reporting any deadlocks.

Any idea what could trigger this to just go off? We are getting the alert every minute yet can't find any actual deadlocks.

Edit: I should add that before this reboot we had never received this error

Edit 2: We used SQL Server Profiler as well to look for deadlocks, let it run for 5 minutes over which we received 5 error alerts and when we checked the details we had NO deadlocks found.

Edit 3: March 06/2014: Ran the query and it worked, but it reports what our other details have said that we have no locks we where still getting the error above the whole time.

Thanks again for all your help!



Edit 4: March 06/2014: I ran the query and here is a sampling of the result set, I will admit I am not exactly sure what I am looking at here, that is to say I am not sure if it shows me something that I can act on or not.



Edit 5: March 07/2014: Image below shows the Alert that generates this error all of a sudden.

Update 3/7/2014

I have updated your screen shot with some basic explanations. What we are seeing, is just a bunch of shared database locks. 

To be brief, the locks on your system are shared (in other words, they don't block other sessions from accessing the database) and those locks are meant to prevent the database from being dropped, detached or renamed while data is being read and/or written from and to that database and its contents.

Getting back to your original question; there are no deadlocks or blocked sessions on your server. I don't remember having seen this message before, but from what you are sending back, this is definitely not about deadlocks and more likely to be just an informational message. 

Or use sp_lock

sp_lock [[@spid1 =] 'spid1'] [,[@spid2 =] 'spid2']

Which will give you a more detailed view of all locks currently being held on your server.

913,913,1448,Is my interval training routine effective for mountain bike training?,"During these winter months I am currently attending the gym 3 times a week. On each of the days I start my training on an exercise bike with the following:


5 minute warm up
30 minutes, 1 minute hard, 1 minute recovery
5 minute warm down


I am using a specific interval training setting on the bike. I preset the training to level 15, which is a high resistance and as much as I can take.

Hard is a cadence of between 80-90rpm high resistance. Recovery is a cadence of 60prm and the resistance backs off considerably, I imagine to approximately level 7.

My heart rate towards the end of the session reaches 170–190bpm, and I am working flat-out. I turn 30 in March, am 5' 8"" and weigh approx 168lbs.

Does this training routine seem sensible for building strength and speed on the mountain? Should I be changing up the training with other types of bike training?

It is also worth noting that after the interval training I perform free weight strength training too.

408,408,634,Laptop wireless networking options: 1x1 vs 2x2,"I am currently customizing a Lenovo Thinkpad.

Under the section ""Integrated WiFi wireless LAN adapters"" there are two options.

Default: ThinkPad 1x1 b/g/n
Upgraded: ThinkPad 2x2 a/b/g/n (+$10 AUD)


What does the 1x1 and 2x2 mean?

For reference, here is the link. 5th option from the bottom.
Customize Lenovo Thinkpad
",Valamas,https://superuser.com/users/68072,"That's a no-brainer. Pay the +$10 AUD and get the 2x2 a/b/g/n. It can move data at up to twice the speed of the ""1x1 b/g/n"" solution, and it supports the much larger, less congested 5GHz frequency band, making it less likely to interfere with (or receive interference from) all the other uses of the 2.4GHz band.

1x1 and 2x2 refer to the number of transmit and receive radio chains built into the Wi-Fi card. 2x2 means it has two transmit and two receive radio chains, and usually implies that it supports 2 ""spacial streams"", which is a key way that 802.11n is faster than the previous generation of Wi-Fi technologies. 802.11n is the first standard in the 802.11 family to support MIMO (pronounced ""MY-moh""), which stands for ""Multiple Inputs, Multiple Outputs"", which is basically a way of ganging together multiple radios to get faster data rates than you can get with a single radio on each end of the connection. Because it's possible to create a wireless card with 2 transmit and 2 receive radio chains but still not do real 2 spacial stream MIMO, some people in the industry now use the notation TxR:S, where T is the number of Transmit radio chains, R is the number of Receive radio chains, and S is the number of supported ""spacial streams"".

Because MIMO was the raison d'être for 802.11n, when the first N gear hit the market in 2007, it was all 2x2:2, which means it can support up to 300 megabit per second data rates when used with 40MHz-wide channels.

Unfortunately, within the last year or so, some companies have been being cheap, and, in my opinion, a bit deceptive, and selling 1x1:1 radios as 802.11n. Technically they do support a few of the slowest 802.11n-style modulation schemes, but since they only have a single transmit and receive radio, they aren't MIMO, and 802.11n without MIMO is like a BLT without bacon.

The maximum data rate a 1x1:1 radio can get is 150 megabits per second, and that's when using a 40MHz-wide channel (sometimes called simply a ""wide channel"", because before 802.11n, all standard 802.11 channels were never wider than about 20 or 22MHz). Wide channels are fine in the 5GHz band which is a much larger band with a lot more channels and a lot less congestion than the old 2.4GHz band.  But in the 2.4GHz band, using wide channels can cause problems because it takes up like two-thirds of the entire band, leaving very little room for things like Bluetooth and neighboring 802.11 networks.  Unfortunately, that 1x1 solution is only b/g/n and doesn't say ""a"", which implies it ONLY supports the small, congested 2.4GHz band.

The 2x2 solution says it supports ""a"" (802.11a), which only worked in the 5GHz band, which means that radio is 5GHz capable. Since it also lists b and g, you know it's 2.4GHz capable.  Also, because it's almost certainly a 2x2:2, it can almost certainly use signaling rates up to 300 megabits per second.

5216,5216,8288,Timing inside a shift register,"How I imagine synchronous digital networks work: data lines are sampled at rising clock edge, a set of transients occur, system settles, and data lines are sampled again on next rising edge. I would place transients at falling clock edges, that way both Tsu and Th time for sampling are clear. (Somewhat similar to SPI bus behavior.)

What see in a datasheet of a real world device (74595): D flipflops connected in series having a common clock. At the output of the first flipflop, transient on the data line follows rising clock edge with Tpd. The next flipflop needs Th time stable data line after rising edge to operate correctly. Of course it works because Tpd>Th, but it's only a matter of nanoseconds.

My problem with all this is that it's not robust (maybe not the best word). Visualizing stuff on a logic analyzer will be less useful because data lines practically change in sync with clock rising edge. Random errors caused by Th>Tpd are not really visible and go undetected. If I connect another shift register in series from a different technology, which requires longer hold times, the circuit won't work, no matter how slow clock I chose.

Is this the way most commonly synchronous digital circuits are constructed? Only the propagation delay of components make it work? Am I being to idealistic? :)

  If I have a parallel circuit of 2 resistances, both zero Ohm, the current would split to 2 and each current would be half. 


""Zero ohms"" is an idealization. If you say you have two zero-ohm resistors in parallel, it just means your model is not accurate enough to determine how the current is split.


  If the resistor R1 would be 1 pico Ohm, and the ammeter zero Ohm, there would be no current through the resistor, and all the current would go through the ammeter?


If ""zero ohms"" means much much less than 1 picoohm, then yes, essentially all the current would go through the ammeter.

But real ammeters have burden resistance that's much much more than a picoohm (more like a few milliohms).


  2) Ohms law.
  R2 is 10 Ohm, current is 1A.
  voltage between point A and B is 0 volt, resistance between A and B is 0 Ohm,
  according to Ohms law, I = V / R = 0 / 0 = 0 A.


You have a false conclusion. Zero divided by zero is not zero. It is an undetermined value. Could be zero or could be infinite, depending on the situation.

To analyze this circuit, restate Ohm's law as V = I R. You know the current is 1 A due to the other circuit elements. You know the voltmeter doesn't pass current. Therefore there's 1 A passing from B to A, and because it's a perfect wire, the voltage is zero.

""This section"" is the section of the 7 requirements of speaking Lashon Hara(*), and the Chofetz Chaim writes that helping one's self cope, while it constitutes valid toeles, still requires the rest of the preconditions for speaking Lashon Hara.

(*) 1 - Firsthand knowledge

2 - Be sure you are not jumping to conclusions

3 - Speak to the offender, if you think that may work

4- Don't exaggerate, or leave out important details

5 - to'eles

6 - Ensure that there is no other route that could cause the to'eles

7 - Ensure that your words will not cause more damage than is duly deserved

506,506,789,What makes LSBit steganography detectable? And what would help in concealing it?,"In a project of mine I took a 24-bit bitmap image and I performed LSBit steganography over it (saved a black and white image inside each of the planes R, G, B) using pixel shuffling and xor encryption.

Is my stenography easy to detect? And what would it take to conceal it? 
",Ahmed Ihsan Tawfeek,https://crypto.stackexchange.com/users/12003,"A general theoretical answer to the title's What makes LSBit steganography detectable? is that in normal images, the LSBit of a pixel in some channel is correlated to higher-order bits in the same pixel and channel, that pixel in other channels, and adjacent pixels, in ways that mere replacement of LSBit tends to strongly alter.

One simple way to improve that is adding noise or blurr to a degree such that the LSBit is nearly indistinguishable from random, in which case it can then be replaced by something equally indistinguishable from random (as resulting from good encryption) with little chance of detection versus an equally noisy/blurry image. Next step is changing only few bits at locations dependent on a key (towards that goal it is necessary to have a small payload, as previously pointed), and have the other pixels randomly noisy according to a good model of the natural image.

From a practical standpoint, sending uncompressed 24-bit bitmap images somewhat is a red flag that basic stego is in use. That would be somewhat less apparent with an additional step of JPEG lossless compression, or PNG or GIF conversion (lossy compression would destroy the hidden message given the LSBit encoding used; more sophisticated stenographic schemes survive that). Notice that sending noisy/blurry images without lossy compression is a waste of bandwidth, and could also raise alarm.

I suggest two ""easy to detect"" tests, to be applied comparatively on your image with stego (after decompression if a lossless compression step is added), and normal images that could be allegedly sent, at least including the one you start from.


Show as an 8-color image the 3 LSBits of each pixel; that can be done by changing each byte x in each RGB plane to ~((x&amp;1)-1). It there something perceptibly remarkable for your image with stego? Update: a 64 or 512-color image using (x&lt;&lt;6)+32 or (x&lt;&lt;5)+16 might also be interesting. (note:  the three expressions are for C, and assume truncation to octet. ~((x&amp;1)-1) yields 0x00 if the low bit of x is clear, 0xFF otherwise).
Is the compression ratio of PNG markedly lower for your image with stego than for normal images?

it should run on a wide variety of Unix/Linux platforms
it should support both short and (GNU) long options


I know that getopts would be the preferred way in terms of portability but AFAIK it doesn't support long options.

getopt supports long options but the BashGuide recommends strongly against it:


  Never use getopt(1). getopt cannot handle empty arguments strings, or
  arguments with embedded whitespace. Please forget that it ever
  existed.


So, there still is the option of manual parsing. This is error-prone, produces quite some boilerplate code, and I need to handle errors by myself (I guess getopt(s) do error-handling by themselves).

So, what would be the preferred choice in this case?

555,555,874,Eclipse C++ formatter puts new line before method identifiers,"I ran into a problem with the Eclipse formatter.  It won't format my code correctly when declaring methods within a class declaration.  It puts a new line after the method's return type.

I already exported the style xml file and examined the settings in it, but none of the settings have any apparent connection to this problem, and the settings editor in Eclipse didn't show the same problem happening in it's sample code for method declarations.

Here is an example bit of code for what I want to have happen:

class MyClass
{
    public:
        MyClass();
        void myMethod();
};


However, this is what I get:

class MyClass
{
    public:
        MyClass();
        void
        myMethod();
};


Again, in the styles editor, the code doesn't have this problem and looks just how I want it to, but in the actual code, the story is different.

I'm using version 3.8.0.  Any help is appreciated.

Edit: I deleted those source files that were formatted incorrectly (after formatting the code several times to no avail) and replaced them with ""identical"" files with the same methods, same structure, etc.  I formatted the code this time and it worked.  This is probably a bug, but I'm leaving it up just in case anyone else encounters a similar problem or has a solution to avoiding this problem in the first place.

",Babu James,https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/49700,"You're understanding it wrong.  Yes, TWCR has a memory address of 0xBC, but that isn't its IO address.

There are two ways of accessing the port - through IO, and through memory.  In C, when you assign a value to that address it changes the address to be the IO address instead and uses an in or an out instruction rather than load or store instructions.

-- edit --

Looking at the definitions file you have posted, there is this little bit:

; Definitions marked ""MEMORY MAPPED""are extended I/O ports
; and cannot be used with IN/OUT instructions
....

I suspect actually that the data sheet is incorrect.  It wouldn't be surprising if that whole section about the TWI were copied verbatim from another data sheet whose TWI interface is IO mapped not memory mapped, such as the ATMega32.  It's not uncommon.

2946,2946,4689,How did Adam and Eve win at Hide and Seek?,"I began reading the KJV a couple months ago, and one question that keeps plaguing my mind is, ""How did Adam and Eve successfully hide from God?""

Genesis Chapter 3:


  8 And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden in
  the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the
  presence of the LORD God amongst the trees of the garden.
  
  9 And the LORD God called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where [art]
  thou?
  
  10 And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid,
  because I [was] naked; and I hid myself.

",jay_t55,https://christianity.stackexchange.com/users/4268,"I like the Pulpit Commentary on this. It says that God called Adam because God wanted to bring him to confession.


  Adam's absence was a clear proof
  that something was wrong. Hitherto he had always welcomed the Divine
  approach. ""And said unto him, Where art thou?"" Not as if ignorant of
  Adam's hiding-place, but to bring him to confession.


You can't play a hide-and-seek game with God (Hebrews 4:13) because He is omnipresent(Psalm 139:8). God demanded confession from Adam. God also wanted to continue the fellowship even though Adam tried to avoid Him. God was seeking Adam because God still loved him despite his disobedience . God wanted to help Adam and Eve on how to cover their nakedness. Not yet skilled or aware of how to make garments, they tried to cover themselves in vain. God helped them by providing garments of animal skin. 

Where art thou? God is always calling us to repent and come to Him. It is our responsibility to response to His call and confess all our sins.

4975,4975,7923,Why not have the gears inside the bottom bracket?,"Looking into an IGH it seems the biggest disadvantage is having a huge amount of rotating mass. I've seen one handmade bike where the IGH sits above the bracket, inside a carbon fibre shroud around the place some bikes have rear suspension. There are two chains, one driving the IGH and another to drive the rear wheel. 

Why not have an internally geared bottom bracket where the cranks drive the input shaft and the crank ring rotates at a ratio selectable by the gear lever? 

Then the rear wheel could have a single drive wheel driven by a chain or belt and a lightweight hub just solid enough to mount the spokes and disc. Then you could have mud-free gearing while reducing rotating mass even below what you have with a conventional cassette... and given that you have thrown out the bottom bracket the overall weight gain would be less.

Quite a job for the home builder to adapt an existing hub I guess but it should be possible.

Notice how it's cleverly named to look like typical Wordpress stuff.

I'm not going to walk through all the code, but basically it's a bunch of base64_encodeed code as a reversed string. The strrev() makes it hard to find the two biggest red flags here: base64_encode and eval. The un-obfuscated code is included below, but here are my biggest takeaways (in addition to what Squish said):


Be on the look-out for eval and base64_decode, but also look for their reversed equivalents: lave and edoced_46esab
Also look for instances of strrev. There are few legitimate uses of all of these in the WP core which will return false positives, but not so many that you can't scrutinize each one.
In my case, the hack doesn't appear for logged in users (It checks client's cookies), so don't let that throw you off. It's a clever twist to confuse the users who are most likely to be looking for it.    


Good night and good luck.

","I won't repeat any of the good advice in Squish's answer. You should also read this article on Wordpress security. I'm just going to cover the specifics of what I learned from my episode.

My attack is a kind of black hat SEO known as ""hideMeYa"": http://siteolytics.com/black-hat-seo-technique-demystified/

Basically, the attacker slips a bunch of hidden links into the content so humans can't see them but google can. So they use unsuspecting sites to drum up back links to shady sites.

It's hard to say for sure how this was done, but in this site there were two known security vulnerabilities:


admin user was still in use (you should delete/rename the admin user).
Outdated plugins and core


In my case, the infected file was my theme's functions.php file. At the very top was this:

Notice how it's cleverly named to look like typical Wordpress stuff.

I'm not going to walk through all the code, but basically it's a bunch of base64_encodeed code as a reversed string. The strrev() makes it hard to find the two biggest red flags here: base64_encode and eval. The un-obfuscated code is included below, but here are my biggest takeaways (in addition to what Squish said):


Be on the look-out for eval and base64_decode, but also look for their reversed equivalents: lave and edoced_46esab
Also look for instances of strrev. There are few legitimate uses of all of these in the WP core which will return false positives, but not so many that you can't scrutinize each one.
In my case, the hack doesn't appear for logged in users (It checks client's cookies), so don't let that throw you off. It's a clever twist to confuse the users who are most likely to be looking for it.    


Good night and good luck.

4632,4632,7347,Reliable way of detecting whether an Android app is running in 'BlueStacks',"I would like to ascertain at run-time inside an Android app whether it is running within the BlueStacks Android emulator. This is so I can modify the way the app runs when running inside BlueStacks.

BlueStacks does not support multi-touch so I want to implement an alternative to the standard pinch-to-zoom functionality my current app has.

E.g.

If (appIsRunningInBlueStacks){
    mySurfaceView.enableMultiTouchAlternatives();
} else{
    mySurfaceView.enableMultiTouchFeatures();
}


What is a reliable way of ascertaining the value of appIsRunningInBlueStacks?

EDIT Summary of answers to comments on question:

Ben, Taras, thanks for the suggestions. The Build.MODEL etc. values for BlueStacks are:


Model: ""GT-I9100""
Manufacturer: ""samsung""
Device: ""GT-I9100""
Product: ""GT-I9100""


This is the same model number as the Samsung Galaxy SII so it would not be ideal to use this for fear of treating all users with SIIs the same as those on BlueStacks.

CommonsWare, the app continues to run in BlueStacks even with the &lt; uses-feature> for multitouch in the manifest. In fact (also answering iagreen's question)...

packageManager.hasSystemFeature(PackageManager.FEATURE_TOUCHSCREEN_MULTITOUCH_DISTINCT);


... returns true! This is to be expected I suppose as the emulator is convinced it is a Samsung Galaxy SII!

Therefore we are still without a way of reliably detecting whether an app is running on BlueStacks without also throwing all Samsung Galaxy SII users in the same bucket. Any other ideas?

2682,2682,4276,Can a malfunctioning relay in an amp cause or allow a speaker to crackle when turning the vol potentiometer?,"Ok, so this question has several layers, I admit it.

I recently acquired a Lepai 2020A+ amp. It is, I believe, the latest version PCB because it has the two relays for speaker protection instead of just the one.

I'm new to electronics, so please excuse my total lack of knowledge.

What I understand is that the function of these relays is to delay the power output to the speakers when the device is turned on; to avoid any pop that may damage the former. It may also work when turning off the device, to avoid a thump... but of this I'm not sure. It's a cheap amp with cheap components.

Anyway, I received it and I noticed the left channel had a slight crackle when I turned the vol pot. It started right when I brought it out of 0 percent. But then it started crackling at around 20, then 50. I assumed it was rust or just the protective film flaking off of the cheap pot. So I sprayed it with some contact cleaner. After much caring for it, I've been able to reduce the crackling back to the original crackling I heard when I first turned the pot. If the amp has been off several hours, then it will slightly crackle when turning the pot up from 0. If I turn the pot a couple of times before turning on the device, then there's no audible issue.

All the time, this is only happening on the left channel. The right one is 100 percent clean. Other than this, the amp works as expected.

However, the other day the amp was off and I turned the pot and heard a slight crackle. I did notice, when I first received the amp through the mail, that if turned off and disconnected, the circuit still retains some power: first thing I did; right out of the box, I switched it on without connecting it and that intensely unnerving blue light the Lepai has around the vol control came on and fade off for a couple of seconds.

So I'm still trying to make sense of this issue. Trying to know if it's a faulty, old pot that's seeing its last days on the left channel and, therefore, I should just invest in a better pot and change it (because the rest of the amp modestly rocks) or if it's more complicated than that... perhaps an issue with the left channel relay, etc., and I'd better change the device entirely.

I probably am shooting way off the mark here but the first thing I thought when I heard that crackle when the amp was off was that perhaps the speaker-protection relay for the left channel is not working. But does a relay like this only work during on and off? Or does it still work throughout the process? And, if so, does it have the ability to ""filter"" these noises?

I'm thinking that even if some ""filter"" component (not necessarily the relay; if any of you knows the Lepai maybe you know if it has any filter incorporated) is not working like it should, that horrible noise must be coming from the vol pot. Am I wrong to think that? And to think that if the right channel is completely clean, then it must be an issue with the side of the pot that outputs to the left channel?

And finally, could this noise be digital and coming from deeper in the circuitry or does it necessarily have to be analog and coming from the pot?

I know this is a layered question but I've been looking for individual answers all over the net and can't find any, so I'm hoping somebody out there can help me out by guiding me into electronics though this, my first mod project.

Thanks a lot in advance!

490,490,764,"Why did my sweet potato hash turn soggy when frying in a non-stick pan, and crispy in a cast iron?","I was making a sweet potato hash for pizza topping the other night, and tried to fry the first batch in a non-stick pan. The hash never crisped up and was soggy, so I ended up mashing it instead. The next batch I fried in my seasoned cast iron, and it crisped up like a good hash.

Does anyone know why this happened? To me, it doesn't make a lot of sense if both the pans were equivalently hot with the same amount of oil to fry in. The hash in the non-stick pan also seemed to absorb more oil, but again, not sure why. 


Details:


I used a similar amount of bacon fat to fry both batches in
The hash was seasoned with garlic, salt and various spices (no onion)
Similar heating levels, preheated both pans
No lids were used
The non-stick pan is a nice Teflon coated Calphalon, and has pretty good heat retention; I use it for stir fry successfully

",Alex Bruce,https://cooking.stackexchange.com/users/33072,"The theories that have come out in comments are most likely right on. Cast iron is special in how well it retains heat. Give cast iron ample preheating time, and you can drop in cold food without a significant drop in the temperature of the pan. That equals crispy. Even a pretty good and heavy non-stick pan is not going to give sweet potatoes the kind of crisp you can achieve with cast iron.

You mention higher sides in the non-stick pan. That alone probably wouldn't make much of a difference, but considering that you're already seeing a greater drop in temperature as you put in the potatoes, the higher sides would hold in more moisture in the cooler pan. That is not a friend of crispiness.

You say that you preheated both pans to about the same temperature. I actually hope your memory is a little off on that :) One of the great joys of cooking with cast iron is that you can and usually should pre-heat it to a quite high temperature without damaging the pan. Teflon, on the other hand, should never be preheated beyond a very moderate temperature for a very short time. Some people go so far as to say that you shouldn't preheat it all.

The hodgepodge has never been crisp, and it's wet, so I finally mashed it up. The next batch of cast iron I've fried with seasoning is crispy like a good Patty.","The theories that have come out in comments are most likely right on. Cast iron is special in how well it retains heat. Give cast iron ample preheating time, and you can drop in cold food without a significant drop in the temperature of the pan. That equals crispy. Even a pretty good and heavy non-stick pan is not going to give sweet potatoes the kind of crisp you can achieve with cast iron.

You mention higher sides in the non-stick pan. That alone probably wouldn't make much of a difference, but considering that you're already seeing a greater drop in temperature as you put in the potatoes, the higher sides would hold in more moisture in the cooler pan. That is not a friend of crispiness.

You say that you preheated both pans to about the same temperature. I actually hope your memory is a little off on that :) One of the great joys of cooking with cast iron is that you can and usually should pre-heat it to a quite high temperature without damaging the pan. Teflon, on the other hand, should never be preheated beyond a very moderate temperature for a very short time. Some people go so far as to say that you shouldn't preheat it all. So if your beginning temperatures were about the same in the pans, they shouldn't have been. After you put in the potatoes, forget about it. You'll never get the same kind of crispy sear with a teflon pan as you will with cast iron, even if you don't know how to best exploit the advantages of cast iron.

4500,4500,7135,How to enable or disable services?,"I read about how to enable and disable services in Ubuntu and it seems that there are different possibilities to manage them.

The first method I found is update-rc.d to add new services to startup, which aims on the /etc/init.d folder and its contents.

The other one I found is to edit .conf files in the /etc/init folder.

What's the recommended way to enable / disable / add services and why?

Could you please give a short bulletproof step by step example on how to add a service in Ubuntu and enable and disable it?
",NES,https://askubuntu.com/users/7155,"There are services that can be enabled/disabled using the GUI (Like the startup application) and then other ways of doing the same through the terminal.

For the Terminal you have several options. Open a terminal (Type ""terminal"" in the dash for example and open it) and keep on reading:

Enabling / Disabling a service

To toggle a service from starting or stopping permanently you would need to:

echo manual | sudo tee /etc/init/SERVICE.override


where the stanza manual will stop Upstart from automatically loading the service on next boot. Any service with the .override ending will take precedence over the original service file. You will only be able to start the service manually afterwards. If you do not want this then simply delete the .override. For example:

echo manual | sudo tee /etc/init/mysql.override


Will put the MySQL service into manual mode. If you do not want this, afterwards you can simply do

sudo rm /etc/init/mysql.override


and Reboot for the service to start automatically again. Of course to enable a service, the most common way is by installing it. If you install Apache, Nginx, MySQL or others, they automatically start upon finishing installation and will start every time the computer boots. Disabling as mentioned above will make state of the service manual.

Temporary enabling/disabling services

To stop and start services temporarily (Does not enable / disable them for future boots), you can type service SERVICE_NAME. For example:


sudo service apache2 stop (Will STOP the Apache service until Reboot or until you start it again). 
sudo service apache2 start (Will START the Apache service assuming it was stopped before.).
service apache2 status (Will tell you the STATUS of the service, if it is either enabled/running of disabled/NOT running.). 
sudo service apache2 restart (Will RESTART the service. This is most commonly used when you have changed, a config file. For example in this case, if you have changed either a PHP configuration or a Apache configuration. Restart will save you from having to stop/start with 2 command lines)
service apache2 (In this case, since you did not mention the ACTION to execute for the service, so it will show you all options available for that specific service.)


This of course can vary depending on the service, for example, with MySQL it would only mention that it is missing a parameter. For other services like networking service it would mention the small list of all options available.

UPSTART

If we would wanted to use the official Upstart way (Note that, for the moment, not all services have been converted to Upstart), we could use the following commands:

status SERVICE - This will tell us if a converted service is running or not. Note that this is deprecated in favor of start, stop, status &amp; restart. It will also tell us if a service was not yet been converted to upstart:

A converted service would typically output the current status (Starting, Running, Stopping...) and process ID. A non converted service would give an error about an unknown job.

Some shortcuts may only work with the service command above but not with the commands below unless they are 100% converted to upstart services:


START - sudo start mysql
STOP - sudo stop mysql
RESTART - sudo restart mysql
STATUS - sudo status smbd


SYSTEMD

Starting with Ubuntu 15.04, Upstart will be deprecated in favor of Systemd. With Systemd to manage the services we can do the following:

systemctl start SERVICE.service - Use it to start a service. Does not persist after reboot   

systemctl stop SERVICE.service - Use it to stop a service. Does not persist after reboot

systemctl restart SERVICE.service - Use it to restart a service

systemctl reload SERVICE.service - If the service supports it, it will reload the config files related to it without interrupting any process that is using the service.

systemctl status SERVICE.service - Shows the status of a serviceTells whether a service is currently running.

systemctl enable SERVICE.service - Turns the service on, on the next reboot or on the next start event. It persists after reboot.

systemctl disable SERVICE.service - Turns the service off on the next reboot or on the next stop event. It persists after reboot.

systemctl is-enabled SERVICE.service - Check if a service is currently configured to start or not on the next reboot.

systemctl is-active SERVICE.service - Check if a service is currently active.

5300,5300,8418,How do I deal with a slow and undedicated colleague in the team?,"I have been working on a new project. The project works like this: The end user can access a webapp using a link and he can add multiple systems on his network and manage that particular systems details. My part involves the front end and the webserver, which is done in python. My python actually communicates with another project which is entirely done in c &amp; c++. The c/c++ project is the main app which does all the functionality. My python sends the user request to it and displays the response from it to the user. 

I am very familiar with my work and I will finish it soon. Since that's not much work in it. And I am a person who loves to work. I spends most of the time in office and only go home when I feel sleepy.

The c/c++ app is managed by another colleague who has 5+ year experience and can do things much faster than me, but he never does it. May be he doesn't like to do it. His app crashes often when my python communicate with it or returns wrong values. It's full of bugs. Since my app depends on it, I am having a hard time building it. Instead of fixing the bugs, he asks me to slow down my work. He asks me to tell manager that my work needs a lot of time. He is asking me to fool the manager and even forcing me to work slowly like him.

During project meeting, when manager asks him about the bugs he says that he fixed everything and it works fine. Since he is my colleague, I couldn't tell anything to the manager. I obviously need to have a good relationship with my colleagues more than my manager, since most of the time we will be with our colleagues, not with the manager.

I am not able to tell the manager anything regarding this, since if manager asks him why, then he may think I complained about him to the manager. And he keeps on lying in the meeting. And since he fixes the bug slowly, it even slows down my work. Now I thought of working on the front-end part of my app  and finishing it off so that in the mean time he can make his project stable. Now he is asking me to tell the manager that my front end part require a lot of work and I may need more and more time, simply so that he can drag the project down. And the sad thing is our actual manager has gone to the US, so we have a temporary manager and this guy doesn't know about the project much, so the c,c++ just fools him.

Can anyone suggest me how I deal with this?
I wanted to finish off the project soon. How can I make him work even by maintaining a good relationship with him?

Responses to comments:


  If he's really deliberately misleading the company, you should report him to management.


I am new to this company and the other guy has been there for many years. And I have just started knowing my colleagues. If I directly go and complaint him, I don't think so I can make good relationship with my other colleagues. Even he has the power to mislead them. I am not telling he is a bad guy, he can do the work, but he is not doing it.


  Doesn't your company have any kind of bug tracking system ? 


Here actual bug tracking system isn't there. The company tries to finish off the project as soon as possible and gives it to the QA. And then fixes the bugs reported by QA. 


  This is why companies should give employees stock / options or some sort of ownership. That way you can literally tell the guy ""You are costing me monetary growth... don't you want to make money also?"".


The company has the stock options they have given me a 2500 share, mostly he too would have got some more.


  Seniority does deserve some benefit of a doubt. You really need to speak to him first and try to understand the problem. He may be out of his depth, you may be able to help him, there could easily be variables you are unaware of. It may be hard now, but you could easily make the situation a lot worse by jumping the gun. 


I even does it, first his app wasn't handling multiple requests at a time, he was using a queue to handle the requests I sent to him. I even suggested to him some of my ideas on it. He said he already had these ideas, and will be executing them. His explanations was: ""Everything require certain time to do and this is a project which may need two years to complete and we are asked to finish it in two months"". I used to have a hard time coding during first few weeks because of this bug. But now he fixed it. But he is using a single queue for a user requests and that is now slowing down the app, since it processes one request at a time.


  What is QA doing this whole time? Why aren't they reporting/confirming the status of the project(s)? 


The manager is the person who decides when to give to the QA. As of now it has not yet given to QA. He said we should give it by this month end.

Based on several answers (see, for instance, here, here and here), I understood that ""will"" is more spontaneous and ""going to"" is used with more planned actions.

So, it seems that everything is pretty fine. However, in this question, Kosmonaut has an answer in which he states:
""Let's say that tomorrow you will walk your dog from 7 - 8 AM"".

On the one hand, you probably planned to walk your dog long before and thus I should use ""Let's say that tomorrow you're going to walk your dog from 7 - 8 am"". 

On the other hand, since I'm saying ""let's say..."", I'm deciding right now (thus, unplanned) that you will walk your dog.

2241,2241,3571,How can you buy train tickets at Oslo Airport?,"In June I will have to travel from Oslo Gardermoen airport to Oslo Central Station to catch the train to Finse. I already booked a ticket from Oslo central station to Finse (with NSB), but didn't want to be tied to a certain time for the ticket from Oslo airport to Oslo Central Station. 

As soon as I pick up my luggage I want to go to the train so that I have some time to spare in Oslo.

I was wondering how easy it is to buy a ticket at the airport, are there any vending machines around where you just can buy a ticket?
",ErikL,https://travel.stackexchange.com/users/12236,"There are actually several viable options, the cheapest would have been to buy a through ticket from the airport to Finse.

The most convenient option, but also the most expensive, is to take the Flytoget (Airport Express Train). Mo-Fr, the trains depart every ten minutes (x:00, x:10, x:20, etc), Sa+Su every twenty minutes (x:10, x:30, x:50) and take 19 or 22 minutes. They are however quite expensive with 170 NOK or about 21 Euros for a one-way ticket to the central station. You can travel without a paper ticket, which sounds quite simple, but you have to be careful not to charge yourself for a longer distance than actually travelled. Travelling from the airport is quite simple, as you must select your destination when swiping your card at the platform gate. If you travel to the airport, you must remember to swipe your card at one of the devices at the departing station, otherwise you will be charged 250 NOK (the tariff for the longest distance). There are also plenty of ticket machines where you can buy regular paper tickets and pay with cash or most credit and debit cards. If you want to pay with cash, be aware that the ticket machines won't accept larger bank notes than 200 NOK.

At least Mo-Fr, it is also a reasonable option to use the regular suburban trains instead of the express trains. They leave twice an hour (0:03 and 0:43) and take 23 minutes to the central station. These trains operate on Sa+Su as well, but not necessarily every hour. The ticket price is 90 NOK or about 11 Euros. You can buy tickets from the NSB/Ruter ticket machines or from the NSB ticket desk. If you are in a hurry, you can also buy your ticket on the train from the conductor, but in that case, have to pay an additional 40 NOK fee.

I have booked a ticket from Oslo central station to fens (with NSB), but I don't want to be limited to a certain time because of the ticket from Oslo Airport to Oslo central station.","There are actually several viable options, the cheapest would have been to buy a through ticket from the airport to Finse.

The most convenient option, but also the most expensive, is to take the Flytoget (Airport Express Train). Mo-Fr, the trains depart every ten minutes (x:00, x:10, x:20, etc), Sa+Su every twenty minutes (x:10, x:30, x:50) and take 19 or 22 minutes. They are however quite expensive with 170 NOK or about 21 Euros for a one-way ticket to the central station. You can travel without a paper ticket, which sounds quite simple, but you have to be careful not to charge yourself for a longer distance than actually travelled. Travelling from the airport is quite simple, as you must select your destination when swiping your card at the platform gate. If you travel to the airport, you must remember to swipe your card at one of the devices at the departing station, otherwise you will be charged 250 NOK (the tariff for the longest distance). There are also plenty of ticket machines where you can buy regular paper tickets and pay with cash or most credit and debit cards. If you want to pay with cash, be aware that the ticket machines won't accept larger bank notes than 200 NOK.

At least Mo-Fr, it is also a reasonable option to use the regular suburban trains instead of the express trains. They leave twice an hour (0:03 and 0:43) and take 23 minutes to the central station. These trains operate on Sa+Su as well, but not necessarily every hour. The ticket price is 90 NOK or about 11 Euros. You can buy tickets from the NSB/Ruter ticket machines or from the NSB ticket desk. If you are in a hurry, you can also buy your ticket on the train from the conductor, but in that case, have to pay an additional 40 NOK fee.

Be aware that the express and suburban trains are operated by different companies and their tickets are not interchangeable. Express train tickets are available at the orange ticket machines. Suburban train tickets are available at the red and gray ticket machines.

I appreciate I want to vary my articulation to make it more interesting, so how would I go about deciding where to place my slurs? Are there certain beats I shouldn't slur between because it would add emphasis in the wrong place?

1728,1728,2732,Mathematics of Ritardando,"Beyond feel &amp; experience, is there a rule conductors use for ritardando in terms of  (a) its rate, (b) its change in rate, and/or (c) the relationship between the final tempo and the tempo of the piece?

(In getting my software to execute a ritardando, I employed over four measures a measure-by-measure decrease in tempo, and what sounded ""right"" to me ultimately was decreasing the tempo by 4 bpm, then a further 9, then a further 16 (pleasing pattern) to arrive at 127/156 (close to 3/4) the original tempo.)

Not that I'm aware of. Such a rule would be of little value, because -- unless you're practicing with a drum machine, or other device that permits varying tempo -- there's generally no good way (other than feel) to for conductors or performers to accurately measure their tempo during a performance. They're certainly not likely to be thinking ""Now this beat has to be played 10% longer than the previous one, and the following beat has to be 17.4% longer than that...""

However, if I had to guess a general shape of a tempo curve in a ritard, they generally seem to be monotonically decreasing (you don't speed up again in the middle of a ritard), and concave downward (i.e., the most ritard'ing comes just before the end of the ritard). But to what degree this is true is up to the conductor or performers to decide.

On the other hand, about the most prescriptive that I've usually seen music notation get is poco rit. (just a little bit of ritardando), or molto rit. (much ritardando). And of course, the dashed line that Richard mentions, to indicate the duration of the ritard.

That said, I am interested in what the tempo curves of actual performances would look like. I know that approximate tempo maps can be created for real performances, and I'd be surprised if someone, somewhere, hasn't researched what these curves look like.

Post #004
Post #005
Post #006


On Post #001 I want to display #002 and #003.

And now the part that worries me: If I don't add a large number to numberposts, it will of course only fetch the standard amount of posts and therefore my code won't work the way I want it.

1734,1734,2742,God the Father's possession of a body of flesh and bones,"There is a belief out there that God the Father has always possessed a body of flesh and bones. Some of the proponents of this belief don't find it contradictory to John 4:24 (""God is a Spirit"") as the verse may be referring only to one part of God without limiting God to being only that one part - just like, for example, in 1 Pet 3:20 (""eight souls were saved by water"") Peter called some humans ""souls"", but he didn't mean by that that they didn't posses bodies.

The example of Jesus after His resurrection, Who, while possessing a body of flesh and bones, still retains all the qualities that are usually ascribed only to God, for example, His omnipresence, could go along with this belief. 

I wonder if Biblical hermeneutics, namely the hermeneutics of the Old Testament, allows for this belief. If not, please, point out those places that speak against the validity of this belief.

510,510,796,How does owning a home and paying on a mortgage fit into family savings and investment?,"I'm in my mid-20's, and so I am aiming at long-term growth with higher risk in my portfolio.  My financial adviser is showing me some investment allocations that put my money in some growth, mid, and value-retention locations.  He doesn't seem to be taking into the equation the fact that I am putting a huge percentage of my paycheck into my home.

I know home values fluctuate, but long term, it seems to be a pretty good way to at least retain value, and at best make a small return.  If I am already contributing so much to my ""home"" investment, why would I also invest in stocks or bonds with a low rate of return, even though they are considered a ""safe"" part of my portfolio?

Update: I think the question really has two parts.

1) How does owning a home fit into my financial portfolio?  Most seem to agree that at best it is a hedge against rent or dollar inflation, and at worst it should be viewed as a liability, and has no place alongside other real investments.

2) How should one view payments on a home mortgage?  How are they similar or different to investing in low-risk low-reward investments?

tput: No value for $TERM and no -T specified


Here is a screenshot of the exact message:


This happened on both my Lubuntu machine and Kubuntu machine, and it wasn't a problem until after I upgraded; so I suspect that it was not user error.

How can I fix this?

UPDATE

I have tracked this down to my .bashrc file, which is getting called by my .profile file.  Though, the fact that my .bashrc file now runs when I do a GUI login whereas it didn't before I upgraded is a bit weird.  And no, I haven't modified my .bashrc file or my .profile recently.  Also, bash isn't my default shell.

The problem is that I am calling tput in my .bashrc file to set up variables for use in adding color to the prompt.  But at the (inappropriate) time when my .bashrc file now gets run, $TERM is not set.

Updated question: How should I fix this?  Should I set $TERM myself?  Or should I just not set these variables if $TERM is not set?

One solution I tried was to check whether $TERM was set. But this didn't seem to work; I still got the same error message.  Here's the code:

456,456,710,Helpless opponent & Coup de Grace,"I had a question about Coup de Grace.

It says you can use it against a helpless opponent. Helpless opponent is defined as ""Paralyzed, held, bound, sleeping, unconscious, or otherwise completely at an opponent's mercy."" 

Now, if I was invisible and behind an unwary opponent, could I use a Coup de Grace because he'd be 'completely at my mercy'?

I've read things in places that this might indicate a yes, but I wanted a definitive answer.

Thanks!

EDIT: I was just using invisibility to set the stage. The point was that the victim has no idea I'm there. Invisible, or not, I just wanted to know if this situation counted as a coup de grace.

4768,4768,7570,"Can a smaller sensor's ""crop factor"" be used to calculate the exact increase in depth of field?","If APS-C and similar crop-sensor digital cameras have a focal length multiplying effect such that a 50mm lens has an apparent focal length closer to the field of view of an 80mm on a full frame camera, and yet at the same time the depth of field for the smaller sensor camera is more like the depth of field a 50mm lens would produce on a full frame camera (using the same aperture), then this would seem to suggest the concept of an ""aperture dividing effect.""

In other words, a 50mm f/1.8 lens on an APS-C camera would act more like a 80mm f/2.8 (approx. 1.8 * 1.6x) lens in 35mm equivalent — for depth of field, not considering exposure.

Can someone with a better understanding of the physics involved clarify this for me.  I've never seen this concept explicitly mentioned anywhere, so I am a bit suspect of it.
",Sean,https://photo.stackexchange.com/users/1480,"There is no ""focal length multiplier effect"", period.
The focal length of the lens does NOT change magically because you use a smaller or larger sensor, it stays exactly the same.

All you get is an image that's cropped from the one you would have gotten had you used the same lens to record an image on a larger size sensor.
The DOF will thus be the same it would have been had you used that larger sensor as well.

2672,2672,4257,How do I deal with a slow and undedicated colleague in the team?,"I have been working on a new project. The project works like this: The end user can access a webapp using a link and he can add multiple systems on his network and manage that particular systems details. My part involves the front end and the webserver, which is done in python. My python actually communicates with another project which is entirely done in c &amp; c++. The c/c++ project is the main app which does all the functionality. My python sends the user request to it and displays the response from it to the user. 

I am very familiar with my work and I will finish it soon. Since that's not much work in it. And I am a person who loves to work. I spends most of the time in office and only go home when I feel sleepy.

The c/c++ app is managed by another colleague who has 5+ year experience and can do things much faster than me, but he never does it. May be he doesn't like to do it. His app crashes often when my python communicate with it or returns wrong values. It's full of bugs. Since my app depends on it, I am having a hard time building it. Instead of fixing the bugs, he asks me to slow down my work. He asks me to tell manager that my work needs a lot of time. He is asking me to fool the manager and even forcing me to work slowly like him.

During project meeting, when manager asks him about the bugs he says that he fixed everything and it works fine. Since he is my colleague, I couldn't tell anything to the manager. I obviously need to have a good relationship with my colleagues more than my manager, since most of the time we will be with our colleagues, not with the manager.

I am not able to tell the manager anything regarding this, since if manager asks him why, then he may think I complained about him to the manager. And he keeps on lying in the meeting. And since he fixes the bug slowly, it even slows down my work. Now I thought of working on the front-end part of my app  and finishing it off so that in the mean time he can make his project stable. Now he is asking me to tell the manager that my front end part require a lot of work and I may need more and more time, simply so that he can drag the project down. And the sad thing is our actual manager has gone to the US, so we have a temporary manager and this guy doesn't know about the project much, so the c,c++ just fools him.

Can anyone suggest me how I deal with this?
I wanted to finish off the project soon. How can I make him work even by maintaining a good relationship with him?

Responses to comments:


  If he's really deliberately misleading the company, you should report him to management.


I am new to this company and the other guy has been there for many years. And I have just started knowing my colleagues. If I directly go and complaint him, I don't think so I can make good relationship with my other colleagues. Even he has the power to mislead them. I am not telling he is a bad guy, he can do the work, but he is not doing it.


  Doesn't your company have any kind of bug tracking system ? 


Here actual bug tracking system isn't there. The company tries to finish off the project as soon as possible and gives it to the QA. And then fixes the bugs reported by QA. 


  This is why companies should give employees stock / options or some sort of ownership. That way you can literally tell the guy ""You are costing me monetary growth... don't you want to make money also?"".


The company has the stock options they have given me a 2500 share, mostly he too would have got some more.


  Seniority does deserve some benefit of a doubt. You really need to speak to him first and try to understand the problem. He may be out of his depth, you may be able to help him, there could easily be variables you are unaware of. It may be hard now, but you could easily make the situation a lot worse by jumping the gun. 


I even does it, first his app wasn't handling multiple requests at a time, he was using a queue to handle the requests I sent to him. I even suggested to him some of my ideas on it. He said he already had these ideas, and will be executing them. His explanations was: ""Everything require certain time to do and this is a project which may need two years to complete and we are asked to finish it in two months"". I used to have a hard time coding during first few weeks because of this bug. But now he fixed it. But he is using a single queue for a user requests and that is now slowing down the app, since it processes one request at a time.


  What is QA doing this whole time? Why aren't they reporting/confirming the status of the project(s)? 


The manager is the person who decides when to give to the QA. As of now it has not yet given to QA. He said we should give it by this month end. 
",HOT,https://programmers.stackexchange.com/users/34092,"As others have mentioned, behaving professionally is the single most important thing for your long-term career.  And honestly, as long as you behave professionally, you'll be in pretty good shape, no matter how those around you behave.  

In this situation, there are a couple of considerations you need to take into account.

First, you need to understand that you are responsible for your program working to the desired specifications, by the given deadline.  If your program interoperates with someone else's program, you are also responsible for making sure that that other program also works by the same deadline.  To put this differently:  If the other person misses their deadline, then you have also missed your deadline, even if your own part of the project was on time.  In management terms, this is called owning the inputs.

You have correctly noted that when your colleague declares in a meeting that his program's bugs are fixed, that you can't immediately declare him as incorrect to the manager (your manager would see that as ""throwing your co-worker under the bus"";  a very bad career move).  Others, on the other hand, have pointed out that it is unprofessional not to declare the true state of the project to the manager.  Both sides are completely correct.

So if it's bad to contradict your colleague in front of the manager, and it's also bad to not contradict him, then what do you do?

The answer is actually pretty simple:  You need to talk to your colleague well before the meeting with the manager, and let them know that at the upcoming meeting you're going to need to tell the manager about the troubles you've been having with their program, and that it's impacting your ability to deliver your side of the project on time, and whether there's anything you can do to help them address the troubles you've been having.  You need to have this conversation at least two full days before the meeting where you will tell the manager, and preferably a full week in advance.

In most cases, just telling your colleague that you're going to have to list their program as a risk at a particular meeting will get them motivated to address the problems you're having, and you never have to talk to the manager at all.  In others, where the problems are more schedule-driven, the colleague will often agree with you, and the two of you can go to the manager together.

I've never had a colleague who didn't either fix things up for me quickly or else agree with my concerns, when expressed this way.  But if it did happen, by giving your colleague advance warning you'd still be in a better position when talking to the manager.  Since you talked to your colleague and tried to work out a solution on your own, and warned them well in advance that you would need to raise the issue at this meeting, your colleague won't be surprised when they do, and the manager won't think that you're simply trying to shift the blame.

Do please remember that when you express your concerns, either to the colleague or to the manager, that your concerns are about your colleague's program which is returning bad data (or whatever else it's doing);  these are measurable things which can be verified and fixed.  Your concerns are not about your colleague being slow or undedicated;  these are not measurable things, which may or may not be true, and which are unlikely to be fixed by bringing them up in a meeting in front of the boss.

5152,5152,8189,How to increase saturation or intensity of this printed pattern,"


The image on the left is what I see on my monitor ( CMYK Vector )
The image on the right was produced using flexography for a packaging design


The image on the right is dull and murky and doesn't 'pop' as much as it should. I think the yellow is the issue. Is it a possibility that my printer is at fault? Could I ask them to increase the % of yellow?

Would a matte or glossy finishing technique help?

OR is the design itself the issue with too many gradients making it hard to accurately reproduce through print?
",Cool Brian,https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/users/30296,"What you see on your monitor is RGB. Yes, it's a CMYK file, and it's likely trying to compensate, but it's still using an RGB model.

As such, what you see on screen is usually always more vibrant/saturated than what CMYK can produce. This is due to the reproducible colors being different in each color space: 



Using coated paper and/or applying a top-coat can certainly help your CMYK print look brighter, but ultimately, you are at the mercy of what CMYK can do. 

At this point, you need to talk to your printer and get their feedback. They may be able to tweak the file to accommodate. Alternatively, if it is yellow that is the issue, perhaps they can swap Y for a more vibrant Pantone Spot Yellow.

3151,3151,5018,image processing,"This is an assignment, i have put good effort since i am new to python programming:

I am running the following function which takes in image and phrase (spaces will be removed so just text) as arguments, i have already been given all the import and preprocessing code, i just need to implement this function. I can only use getpixel, putpixel, load, and save. That is why coding this has been a hard task for me.

def InsertoImage(srcImage, phrase):  
    pix = srcImage.load()  
    for index,value in enumerate(phrase):  
        pix[10+index,15] = phrase[index]  
    srcImage.save()  
pass  


This code is giving ""system error"" which says that ""new style getargs format but argument is not tuple""

    pix[10+index,15] = phrase[index]  
SystemError: new style getargs format but argument is not a tuple  


Edit:

Ok Thanks, i understood and now posting code but i am getting error for the if statement not sure why the if statement is not working, here is full code sorry for not adding it entirely before: 

from future import division  

letters, numbers, and punctation are dictionaries mapping (uppercase)

characters to Images representing that character

NOTE: There is no space character stored!

from imageproc import letters, numbers, punctuation, preProcess  

This is the function to implement

def InserttoImage(srcImage, phrase):
    pix = srcImage.load()
    for index,value in enumerate(phrase):
        if value in letters:
           pix[10+index, 15]  = letters[value]
        elif value in numbers:
           pix[10+index, 15]  = numbers[value]
        elif value in punctuation: 
           pix[10+index, 15]  = punctuation[value]
    srcImage.save()
    pass  

This code is performed when this script is called from the command line via:

'python .py'

if name == 'main':
    srcImage, phrase = preProcess()
    InserttoImage(srcImage, phrase)  

Thanks, letter, numbers, and punctuation are dictionaries which see the key element and open the image (font).
But still there is an issue with pix[10+index, 15] as it is giving error:

3079,3079,4900,Macro that follows a link and downloads the table into a new sheet,"I am a geologist working for a small oil company in Louisiana. I constitute our tech department, and unfortunately my experience with coding is quite limited. I have used very basic vba coding in the past, but I dont code that much in my daily job, so I have forgotten most of it.

The louisiana dnr keeps amazing records for every single oil well drilled in the state and all of these records are located at www.Sonris.com. Part of these records are the production records for each well. I would like to create a macro that follows a given url and downloads the table found on the URL (aka the production records). After it downloads the file, I would like it to put the table in a new sheet and then to name this sheet based on the well name. 

I have fooled around with the retrieve data from web function, however I cannot make the function dynamic enough. I need the code to copy the hyperlink data found in a cell. Currently, the code just follows the hyperlink that I copy and paste while recording the macro. 

Any help would be appreciated

There are some small differences in the drop test. The energy of the flat anvil drop test in the B-95 standard is 110J vs. 100J for the RS-98 ski standard.  The hemispherical anvil drop test is 80 J for RS-98 and 72 for B-95.

5917,5917,9373,Why is PWM used to control LEDs even when they're only used On or Off?,"I've noticed on cars with LED tail lights that they have a flicker to them - I presume because they're PWM controlled.
But I've seen it on vehicles where brake lights and tail lights are separate luminaires, therefore are just on or off and do not have varying brightness. I understand that LEDs need to have current through them limited, but I don't see how PWM would achieve this?

Edit: bad phrasing - sorry. Better phrasing: why would the LEDs be flickering even though there is no apparent feature to allow changing of the brightness? Perhaps the brightness is factory set, or maybe there is a feedback circuit to keep brightness constant. But could there be any other reason?

Thoughts: because a vehicle's battery has a significantly different voltage across it when the engine is off or on, (12v vs 14.5v) perhaps there is a controlling PWM circuit that keeps brightness constant over a range of voltages. Saying that, I'm convinced that smart phone screen back-lights have some flicker to them even on full brightness, yet their Li-ion batteries' voltages are near constant.
",Jodes,https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/4436,"Contrary to initial intuition, it's actually to increase the brightness.

LEDs can be driven at a constant current, or they can be driven with a pulsed current.

With constant current you have to limit the current to a relatively low value - for instance many common small LEDs are limited to a constant current of say 20mA.  That gives good brightness for indication purposes, but it's not that great.

LEDs, when driven with pulsed current, can be driven with a considerably higher current - maybe 5 to 10 times as much, or even more.  That could be say 100mA for what would normally be a 20mA LED.  However, there are restrictions on what the pulses can be - typically with limits on the frequency and duty cycle - maybe as little as 1% duty.

The end result is that the higher current increases the perceived brightness of the LEDs, since more photons are being emitted when they are on, but at the cost of some flicker, which is only really noticed when the LEDs are in motion.

So you get more perceived brightness from smaller and cheaper LEDs without using more current (often less current) on average than if they were on constant.

2837,2837,4513,"create a list (or any variable) dynamically, add data to each list and later compare them in C#","I have a list of some strings and I want to create a list for each of them dynamically inside a loop.

The main idea is to get each string from this list through the loop and create a list with this string as a name. Then add some data to it.

Update:
Basically, I am going to add data to the list using some database APIs on runtime and the string names are the keys in that API. So with each name in the main list, I will retrieve some data from the database, create a list with that name and add data to it. Later we will compare them together. So the basic question is still how do I create these lists at runtime.

1356,1356,2136,How soon after baking can you refrigerate freshly made fruit pies?,"How soon after baking a fresh fruit custard pie can I refrigerate it? Must it be at room temperature before it's put in the fridge?
",Deedee,https://cooking.stackexchange.com/users/36628,"EDIT: Although the question title says ""fruit pies,"" the question specifies a ""fruit custard pie.""  The following answer relates to custard pies and other pies containing fillings with eggs and/or milk.  Actual plain ""fruit pies"" generally contain enough sugar to prevent rapid spoilage and therefore often do not require refrigeration.  If you do plan to refrigerate a plain fruit pie, there's no significant advantage to getting it into the fridge quickly.



Pies do not have to come down to room temperature before refrigeration.  In fact, most food safety organizations recommend the same general policy for egg-based and dairy-based pies as they do for other foods: don't leave leftovers out for more than 2 hours after cooking.  See, for example, recommendations here:


  Foods which contain eggs and milk, with high moisture content, must be
  kept refrigerated, as bacteria love to grow in these foods. Failing to
  put that pie back into the refrigerator before it has remained on the
  counter for more than 2 hours can make a very merry celebration for
  the bacteria, but not so good for friends and family.


So, 2 hours should be a maximum before refrigeration.

As for recommendations about the appropriate time to let cool at room temperature, see here, for example, which states:


  Cool cream pies at room temperature for only  30 minutes after you
  take them out  of the oven.
  
  After 30 minutes, put them in the refrigerator  to complete the
  cooling and to keep them  cold.


While it says ""cream pies"" here, the guidelines above in that link imply that such guidelines also relate to custard and pumpkin pies.  (The first link above also says the same thing about pumpkin pies.)

Basically, the only reason to keep a dairy-based or egg-based pie out of the refrigerator after removing from the oven is to allow cooking and setting to continue.  Many custard pies will continue to set a bit while cooling, and putting them in the refrigerator immediately might ""shock"" them and disrupt this process of solidification.  Changes in humidity levels and condensation might also have unpredictable effects on the pie surface while it is very hot.

(As for concerns about putting hot food in the fridge, see links to food safety organizations on the subject in my answer here.  Basically, you shouldn't put a hot or warm pie near anything that's very perishable in the fridge.  Otherwise, you're safer getting it in the fridge as soon as it has stablized after cooking, which shouldn't take more than 30 minutes or so.)

Ok i guess my first explanation was not good.
Retrieving through jquery a json and build a table is good, i could do that, but my request was more on the other part. 
I'm looking for a library to display the result in a special way. 
Let me explain. 
Json request 1 send :

Json request 2 send : 
1;Tomato 3;Salad 4;Carot 5;Potatoes 

I would like the second row disapear with a effect (fadeOut) and the rows below move Up. For the row 5, i just want a new row appears with a fade in. 

Is that more clear ? 

Is there any livrary existing doing this ?

Thanks again

I'm doing it in PHP, but i hope to write all this in JS.

The user could just look the table and see the new rows appearing and the old rows deleting.

Any ideas or am i supposed to write it from scratch ?

1126,1126,1767,What's the best way to scan in hundreds of pictures?,"I have thousands of old pictures which were sitting in a photo album. Unfortunately, instead of the photo album protecting the pictures, the plastic coverings yellowed, and the pictures themselves had to be carefully extracted from the books. There is also quite a bit of powdered paper (the backings on the books pretty much fell apart while we extracted the pictures), and the fronts of the images are still a bit sticky.

These pictures are 30+ years old, are often extremely faded, and were originally taken on (what I think is) ""110 film"" -- they are approximately 2.5"" squares.

Anyway, I need to scan all these images in to preserve them from further decay. Unfortunately, it's taking forever -- going through less than 100 images took an entire day, even if one discounts any time spent in Photoshop trying to remove some of the photo album's artifacts on the images.

What I really need is some method of scanning the images in faster. Most automated solutions aren't going to work because they accept 4x6s as their smallest image size, and even if that was not the case, the adhesives still stuck to the prints would probably ruin any such device in 5 seconds flat.

1844,1844,2926,Sending Via PIC18F97J60 EUSART,"When trying to send and receive using a PIC18F97J60 and MAX232 using a program written with the C18 compiler, I am only able to transmit data.  For receiving, I have tried at least 50 methods but none are working. I even tried the software on multiple micro-controller boards to check for a hardware problem but none of the boards ever receive anything. I believe that the following items are correct:


My clock is perfect at 41.6667MHz
My baud generation is perfect
My hardware is OK (some other IIIrd party hex code able to receive also)
My host PC, its COM port, and the serial cable are OK


Can anyone guide with probable areas I may be missing?

------------------ FURTHER CLARIFICATIONS -------------------------------------------

Thanks Olin for helping, you are great man. Sorry for not putting my question correctly. Please note:

I was trying to do serial I/O to write a boot loader for the PIC18F97J60 myself as my vendor's supplied boot loader stops sending/receiving with PCloader software after a partial user application hex download.  It also ensures that RS232 port is able to both send and receive.  Moreover, Microchip's boot loader described in AN1310 also stucks on receiving data. 

My sample application (a bootloader) is able to transmit but never receives anything.  I'm in soup: either I need a new boot loader or my application must work. I have never faced such a problem in my 12 years of development and I am feeling like a fool.

Other details as you requested are as follows:


I had 10-12 PIC18F97J60 cards with MAX232 on C6/C7 for Serial I/O. The problem is the same for all boards (of different batches).
I wish to do 9600 baud, 8 bit, no parity, 1 stop, no handshake, no interrupt data exchange with RealTerm (Better Than Hyperterminal - Displays HEX Code). 
My clock and baud rate calculations are perfect for 41.6667MHz. I have set OSCTUNE = 0x40 and BAUDCON = 1084. I am able to receive perfectly on the PC with RealTerm.
My program not able to receive anything on the PIC but able to transmit.
I tried polling as well as interrupt but nothing works.


Snippet of code is as follows:

void putchar(unsigned char Char)
{
    //Wait for (TSR==1)
    while(TXSTA1bits.TRMT!=1);
    //Trasmit Current Data
    TXREG1= Char;
    //Wait for (TSR==1)
    while(TXSTA1bits.TRMT!=1);
}

void putstr(unsigned char *String)
{
     do
     {
         putchar((*String));
     }while(*String++);
    //CR
     putchar(CR);
    //LF
    putchar(LF);
}

void main(void)
{
    unsigned char RS232[] = ""RS-232"";
    OSCTUNE = 0x40;
    TXSTA1 = 0x24;
    RCSTA1 = 0x90;
    BAUDCON1=0x08;
    SPBRGH1=0x04;
    SPBRG1=0x3C;

Otherwise if the receive buffer overruns, you won't just lose a received byte--you'll lose all data forevermore.

I'm not really sure why Microchip designed their UARTs this way.

539,539,848,Congenital blindness due to retinitis pigmentosa - does it exist?,"Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) patients typically become blind after a period of years in which their eye sight slowly deteriorates due to photoreceptor degeneration.

However, Chebat et al. (2007) make mention that their study group, consisting of congenitally blind subjects, includes one person with RP (see table 1 in the linked article). Hence, this implicates that this particular subject was blind from birth due to effects of RP.

972,972,1540,How can I use an SVG image as a map marker in OpenLayers-3?,"I am trying to create map ""pin-drops"" (ie. map markers) in OpenLayers-3 (OL3) using SVG images.

Currently, I am using PNG images as the pindrops that reference the ol.style.Icon source (“src”) property attribute just fine. However, this fails using an SVG image. Is there some other way to use an SVG in the same manner? Maybe by using a reference besides ol.style.Icon even? There is already a lot of built-in SVG in Open Layers so this should be possible, but I haven't found a way to get this working in OL3. Is there some other way to do this in OL3 that I should consider?

Please note: we already tried using an ol.Vector layer, however when the user zooms in/out, the size of the SVG image grows/shrinks which is an inadequate workaround.



OL3 (fails): 

var createMapMarkerImage = function() {
    return function(feature, resolution) {
        var iconStyle = new ol.style.Style({
            image: new ol.style.Icon( ({
                src: 'img/map_pindrop.svg'   // OL3 doesn’t like this, but accepts a .PNG just fine
            }))
        });
        return [iconStyle];
    };
};


Very similar functionality, is the below example I found online, is almost perfect if it weren’t for the fact that the example uses OpenLayers-2 (OL2) functionality which calls openlayers.js library (instead of OL3’s ol.js library). Sadly, swapping these javascript files out fails.



OL2 (works -but is the old OL library):

4978,4978,7928,how to calculate intersection time and place of multiple moving arcs,"I have rocks orbiting moons, moons orbiting planets, planets orbiting suns, and suns orbiting black holes, and the current system could have many many layers of orbitage.

the position of any object is a function of time and relative to the object it orbits.
(so far so good).

now I want to know for a given 2 objects(A,B), a start time and a speed, how can I work out the when and where to go. I can work out where A and B is given a time.
so i just need.

1: direction to travel in from A to B(remember B is moving(not in a straight line))
2: Time to get to b in a straight line. 

travel must be in a straight line with the shortest possible distance.

as an extension to this question, how will i know if its better to wait, EG is it faster to stay on object A and wait for a hour when the objects may be closer, than to set off from A to B at the start.

Cheers, it hurt my brain.
",user20733,https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/users/20733,"That's not so bad if you know the position of A and B at all times. Example:

A is at the origin. 
B is traveling around the origin at a distance of 1. (ie, it's orbit is the unit circle)
Let Y be the object leaving A. 

Let the speed of B be such that every second B crosses an axis. So the period of B is 4 seconds. Therefore the position of B at any given point in time is:
(cos(t * pi/2), sin(t * pi/2))

Let the speed of Y be such that every second Y can travel s distance. So after one second, if travelling along the positive x axis, Y will be s away from A. 
Therefore A creates another ""orbit"" to how far it can go every second based on:

sqrt(x^2+y^2) = s*t

Now you just need to determine what value of t is required to determine when these two things will intersect. 

This is a very simple case but it will more or less work for any 2D situation you would just obviously need to change the numbers around. Since you already have a function for B you can just replace mine with yours. The other equation is the same for every case. 

Now if you add another dimension and introduce physics modeling more of how our world works then this becomes nontrivial and could be very difficult and I'd just avoid it entirely. 

You'll know to wait if it takes longer to travel at the current position than it does at the time it takes to travel at a later position plus the wait time.

3144,3144,5009,Demonstrating the effect of aliasing,"How does the signal look when we don't use the Nyquist rate to remove aliasing from a signal during sampling?

Let's suppose the signal is sinusoidal, with a frequency of 500&nbsp;Hz and an amplitude of 2.

signal = 2*cos(2*pi*500*t)


If I sample it, (replacing t=nTs , Ts = sampling period and n represent number of samples) and plotting the sampled signals with a different sampling period using the subplot command in MATLAB, how could I identify the aliasing in a sampled signal?

Here is the example code that plotted two signals, one at the Nyquist rate while the other less than the Nyquist rate:

A = 2;
Fmax = 10;
Fs = 2*Fmax;
n = 0:1/Fs:1;
Cont = A*sin(2*pi*(Fmax/Fs)*n);
Cont1 = A*sin(2*pi*(Fmax/18)*n);
subplot(2,1,1)
stem(n,Cont)
hold on
stem(n,Cont1)

5645,5645,8949,Is my interval training routine effective for mountain bike training?,"During these winter months I am currently attending the gym 3 times a week. On each of the days I start my training on an exercise bike with the following:


5 minute warm up
30 minutes, 1 minute hard, 1 minute recovery
5 minute warm down


I am using a specific interval training setting on the bike. I preset the training to level 15, which is a high resistance and as much as I can take.

Hard is a cadence of between 80-90rpm high resistance. Recovery is a cadence of 60prm and the resistance backs off considerably, I imagine to approximately level 7.

My heart rate towards the end of the session reaches 170–190bpm, and I am working flat-out. I turn 30 in March, am 5' 8"" and weigh approx 168lbs.

Does this training routine seem sensible for building strength and speed on the mountain? Should I be changing up the training with other types of bike training?

It is also worth noting that after the interval training I perform free weight strength training too.
",DigiKev,https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/users/3323,"Whether an interval training is effective or not depends mostly on your particulars relative to the interval. Heart rate is only a very inexact measure of effort, but you seem to be roughly in the ballpark. However, such quick switching between on/off interval state does not generally produce interval-like results and should be viewed as a single 30-minute interval at the average power of this period. 

A better gauge of interval quality would be this: how long can you keep up the effort? A more typical interval training might be e.g. 6-7 times 3-8 minute efforts, with 2-5 minute rests, at such intensity that you simply cannot complete another interval round.

A goal of ""strength and speed"" on the mountain is unspecific enough that you can be sure it's being helped somewhat, and in some way, by the intervals. However, it's counterproductive to do interval training and weight training both in one session.

Every day, I start to train on my exercise bike, including:","Whether an interval training is effective or not depends mostly on your particulars relative to the interval. Heart rate is only a very inexact measure of effort, but you seem to be roughly in the ballpark. However, such quick switching between on/off interval state does not generally produce interval-like results and should be viewed as a single 30-minute interval at the average power of this period. 

A better gauge of interval quality would be this: how long can you keep up the effort? A more typical interval training might be e.g. 6-7 times 3-8 minute efforts, with 2-5 minute rests, at such intensity that you simply cannot complete another interval round.

A goal of ""strength and speed"" on the mountain is unspecific enough that you can be sure it's being helped somewhat, and in some way, by the intervals. However, it's counterproductive to do interval training and weight training both in one session. If you are still in shape to do weight training after your intervals, it means the intervals weren't done hard enough. Do intervals and weights on alternate days.

2054,2054,3274,What is a sci-fi system that would feel familiar to reluctant Pathfinder players?,"For the last few months I've been running a Pathfinder campaign, and recently I told my players that I needed a break and they agreed on switching games for a few months. I'm a fan of the works of Isaac Asimov, Larry Niven and so on, and science fiction would be a great change of pace. So here is my opportunity! At last! Or not?

My problem is my players have never liked anything that isn't D&amp;D or Pathfinder. We're all well into the thirties, and the majority have a taste for long campaigns (they really enjoy character development) and some big differences about what we want in a game. The one player who's also a regular GM has a greater appreciation for new games, but the rest is usually scared off by words like ""indie"", and ""FATE"".

I ran a Traveller campaign years ago using GURPS. They hated GURPS. I took off the GURPS part and added ""Mongoose"". They hated Mongoose. I tried Diaspora. They hate FATE. I talked about Ringworld, but I found BRP is not a good system for sci-fi. Jovian Chronicles? ""It has to be as bad as Tribe 8."" (Their words, not mine). Every time I suggest anything that's not Pathfinder it's the same song.

Though I find Traveller good enough, obviously now it's not an option. My latest reading has been a game based on FUDGE (far enough from FATE) inspired by movies like Alien, Predator and alike. I fear a one-session campaign and new ""hate"". It has to be a game that fits my group. Right?

Of course it may be that there's no such game and I have to deal with my players instead, so ""There is no such game"" is an answer I'll reluctantly accept.
",Cazacurdas,https://rpg.stackexchange.com/users/7885,"The best way is to get buy-in from your players. One way of doing that is giving them a selection of games that you would enjoy and asking them to decide amongst themselves which to play. This leverages a bit of human psychology where we will invest in something more if we have a hand in choosing it, especially if, in the process of choosing it, we ever argue for its merits to a peer. Giving your players a choice of sci-fi games means that the one they pick will have at least a little bit of support from at least some of your players already built-in.

Pick three or four games and present them to your players. Say you're running one of these, but which is up to them. Don't defend the games if they disparage them, just ask them to pick the one they think they'll enjoy the most. (By not allowing them to make you a target of arguments, you prevent them from digging in their heels and deciding preemptively they'll hate it.) If they hate it, well, they chose it. Which specific games you present them is up to you, but if I were doing this and trying hard to keep them all as appealing to dedicated Pathfinder players as possible, I would include at least one of these three if not all of them:


Stars Without Number is based on an older edition of D&amp;D, so it's as close as you will come to the feel of Pathfinder, mechanically, as a science-fiction system can get. As a bonus, it's free, and if your players like it, it's very well supported with for-pay supplements and print books.

As a fan of Traveller, you should find the GM's side of SWN to be pleasantly familiar too. It's built to accommodate a system-hopping game or a campaign that stays on one world, and the ""tags"" system for setting development means you have a constant supply of new ideas at the roll of a die. It will work for a one-shot as well as Pathfinder would – possibly better, because new characters are not quite as complicated, and it gives you tools for quickly ""statting up"" a world.
Thousand Suns is exactly aimed at re-creating the genre of Isaac Aasimov, Niven, Pournelle, and their kindred in classic science fiction. Written by a luminary of classic D&amp;D blogging, James Maliszewski of Grognardia, it's a straightforward system that still has its roots in D&amp;D, so it doesn't ask players coming from a d20 background to make a paradigm shift in ""how RPGs work"" like Fate does, and it doesn't have the explosion of complexity (compared to d20) that GURPS or BRP does. It has stats with unfamiliar names but familiar function, and a skill system that should feel familiar enough to them.
d20 Future is going to be very familiar to your players. It's a bit more generic in that it's aimed at creating all kinds of sci-fi, not just the sort written by the authors you mention, but it will do the job. Being a supplement to d20 Modern it does require more books, but the breadth of character options will probably be welcome to your players, since lots of ""chunky"" character build options (as opposed to the fine-grained ones of GURPS, et. al.) is one of the big draws of d20 for its dedicated fans. d20 Future and Modern both have SRDs online, which somewhat makes up for the extra materials you need by making them free.


I strongly suggestion one of those, but the most important part is to give them a shortlist of games you're willing to run and then make the decision theirs. They've already agreed to a change of game, and it's only for a short time, so they should at least be able to agree on one they think they won't hate.

And if they do hate it, all is not lost: you've played a bit of a game you want to play, and you've burned only one of thousands of games that you could try. Really, you could keep trying one-shots of strange new games regularly, and it would take you decades to go through even a fraction of the RPGs currently published, and there are more every year; so don't worry too much if they hate it.

4060,4060,6478,DNS/MX issues arising when migrating Heroku app to Dream Host hosted domain,"I have a domain - myapp.com - hosted by Dream Host. Up until recently I had some php as a signup form at that domain. I also had a one-click install of Word Press at blog.myapp.com, and could log into GMail through Google Apps from Dream Host at mail.myapp.com. 

A few days ago I migrated my Rails app over to myapp.com using Heroku's Zerigo add-on. Zerigo worked magic migrating my app over to myapp.com, however blog.myapp.com didn't work, and neither did mail.myapp.com. (I could access mail but I had to go mail.google.com/a/myapp.com. Plus I was having people tell me their emails to me were bouncing back with errors.)

I contacted Dream Host who helped with getting my blog back - they had me use custom DNS by setting the A record with value 173.236.196.13 for blog.myapp.com
and www.blog.myapp.com. I did this in Zerigo. The blog was back.

However, I still couldn't access my mail through mail.myapp.com. So I went back to Dream Host and they told me to:


Have MX records set for myapp.com and mail.myapp.com pointing to mx1.sub4.homie.mail.dreamhost.com. and mx2.sub4.homie.mail.dreamhost.com. Priority of 0 (zero) for both.
Set an A record for mail.myapp.com pointing to 208.97.132.231 and another for webmail.myapp.com pointing to 208.97.187.139. 


I did all of the above in Zerigo as well and nothing worked. Worse yet, I think my email stopped working. So I removed the MX records for dreamhost, as well as the A records pointing to 208.97.187.139.

So where things currently stand, I have an app that works, a blog that works, but email that I still can't access at mail.myapp.com. And that freaks me out. How can I fix this?

I should note that I'm trying to send mail from my app in SendGrid and GMail (only locally), but have my email accounts and everything else with Google Apps.

I've pasted in all of my Zerigo DNS info below:

1939,1939,3092,"How to prevent the ""Too awesome to use"" syndrome","When you give the player a rare but powerful item which can only be used once but is never really required to proceed, most players will not use it at all, because they are waiting for the perfect moment. But even when this moment comes, they will still be reluctant to use it, because there might be an even better moment later. So they keep hoarding it for a moment which will never come. 

In the end, they will carry the item around until it is outclassed by other, more readily available resources, or even until the very end of the game. That means that such one-shot items don't provide any gameplay-value at all. They are simply too awesome to use.

What can you do to encourage the player to make use of their one-shot items and not hoard them?
",Philipp,https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/users/21890,"Players should use an item when either (1) they can replace the item for a cost which is lower than the cost averted by using it, or (2) the cost of not having the item available later will be greater than the cost of using it immediately.  I don't like it when games punish the player for conserving resources in any fashion beyond the fact that players naturally don't benefit from things they don't use.  I also dislike it when games arbitrarily confiscate conserved items.  Instead of doing such things, games should try to convey to the player the idea that if an item will be needed, it will be possible to replace it, though perhaps at the cost of having to do some otherwise-unnecessary side missions.  If the player can, given time, earn an unbounded amount of in-game currency, an item might be sold in the ""arcana"" section of a shop where e.g. the first MagicWhatzit costs $1,000; the second costs $1,200; the third, $1,500, etc. rising at a rate which is noticeable but not overly frightening.  Such rules could encourage reasonable conservation without encouraging excessive hoarding, since players could have a sense that if they can avoid using a MagicWhatzit, they can avoid having to run a 10-minute side mission to get another one, but if running a ten-minute side mission would be easier than getting by without a MagicWhatzit, then they should use it.

This ties in with an economic principle, which has real-world consequences as well: if one wants people to perceive a resource as having a significant but not limitless cost, they must actually pay the cost if they use the resource.  If squandering a resource will mean that a players has to spend some of their real-world time running a not-terribly-exciting side mission to get it back, players will have an incentive not to squander it.

746,746,1181,How to determine directions of vectors of an electromagnetic wave,"I did an exercise which probably is quite popular,
in which you draw an electromagnetic wave and prove that it should
propagate at the speed of light $1 \over \sqrt {\mu_0\epsilon_0}$ using Farday's law and Ampere's law.

Basically if this is the wave: 




Let's say the E-field (red) is in the X direction, the B-Field (blue) is in the Y direction,
and the velocity of the wave is in the Z direction.

You take for example for ampere's law a surface in the ZY plane with a length L
equal to the amplitude of the wave,
and a width equal to $\lambda\over 4$
You do a similar thing with Faraday's law and you get the speed of light,
assuming you know that the E-field and B-field propagate in this manner.

I got the right answer but I wondered about this:
Let's say I only had the E-field and I know the wave propagates at the speed of light, I assume this is enough information to draw the B-field at each point.

But how will I know the direction? Both Faraday's law and Ampere's law say you need a closed loop integral and the rules I've been taught say
you go over the loop in a clockwise direction for example and take the 
normal to the surface according to the right hand rule etc.

But clockwise and counter-clockwise direction don't really give me much information in this case, so how can I determine the direction of the B-field
if I only have the E-field?
",fiftyeight,https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/6743,"If you're careful about how you define the surface, then you will get the correct direction out of Maxwell's equations. In vector calculus (and generally in math and physics), a surface has an orientation, which also specifies the orientation of the loop that forms its boundary. So you can't just pick a direction to go around the loop at random. The direction in which you go around the loop is related to the orientation of the normal vector to the surface.

Of course, you don't actually need to do a surface integral to figure this out. The electric and magnetic fields in an EM wave (at any given position and moment in time) are related by the equation

$$\mathbf{B} = \frac{1}{c}\hat{\mathbf{k}}\times\mathbf{E}$$

where $\hat{\mathbf{k}}$ is a unit vector that points in the direction of propagation of the wave. If you don't know which direction the wave is moving, you can't tell which way the magnetic field points.

442,442,688,Using Pi to stream all audio output from my pc to my stereo,"My problem is quite simple but I have been unable to find a satisfying solution.

Basically, I want my Raspberry Pi to be connected to my stereo and then play any audio output from my computer via wifi to the PI.

Is there any way to do this easily, without having to use special players? I.e. Is there anyway for the PC to just recognise the Pi as ""speakers""?'

I would like to hear every sound on my PC on the stereo, ie. Gaming, music, system sounds, notifications, youtube videos etc.

Thanks very much!
",Jerome,https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/users/10614,"Wanted to do this myself from Windows7 -> RaspberryPi (OpenElec) and stumbled over your question.
After quite some research I still did not find a satisfying solution for OpenElec but had enough info to come up with one that is very simple and really works with high quality and only about ~1sec delay!

You need:


VLC Media Player (I used v2.1.3 Rincewind on my Win7 x64)
A soundcard that provides a ""Stereo Mix"" recording device (I
was fortunate enough to have one on-board)
A Raspberry Pi (I use OpenElec 4.0.5, although it should work for XBMC in general)


Note: If you do not have a soundcard that supports this you could try to use VAC (http://www.virtualaudiocable.net/), although I am tellin' you it did not work properly for me, poor audio quality and buffer problems all the way...but maybe it's just me.

Step 1)

Create a batch file which starts a VLC http streaming service in background and captures audio from the ""Stereo Mix"" recording device:

@echo off

set vlc=""C:\Program Files (x86)\VideoLAN\VLC\vlc.exe""
start """" %vlc% --qt-start-minimized dshow:// :dshow-vdev=none :dshow-adev=""Stereo Mix (Realtek High Defini"" :live-caching=10 :sout=#transcode{vcodec=none,acodec=vorb,ab=500,channels=2,samplerate=44100}:http{dst=:8080/audiostream.ogg} :sout-keep


Notes:


You might have to change the recording device if yours has a different name, I used Audacity (http://audacity.sourceforge.net/) to check the names of my capture devices since I already had it installed
Yes, the audio bitrate is very high (maximum for Vorbis), but the higher the bitrate the quicker the buffer is filled and hence the shorter the delay :-) (you cannot change the buffer size explicity for music on XBMC, I use 5MB buffer on mine in general)
I tried FLAC, MP3 and even WAV and apart from the fact that only MP3 and Vorbis worked at all with my Pi, I had the quickest loading time on the Pi (basically instantly) and the least delay with Vorbis


Step 2)

Navigate to 


  \\rapsberrypi\Userdata\playlists\music


and create a .strm file with a name of your choice there (I called mine VLC.strm) which contains the plain link to your VLC stream: (change IP to IP of your PC :p)

http://192.168.0.1:8080/audiostream.ogg


Step 3)

You can now either set the audio device which is captured by ""Stereo Mix"" to default in the windows sound settings or open a player like VLC and manually use the non-default device to play music on your RaspberryPi:

Open your VLC (in addition to the one minimized in your tray which is streaming your ""Stereo Mix"") and perform the following steps:


Tools -> Preferences
Audio
Output module: ""WaveOut audio output""
Device: - your (analog) device which is captured by the ""Stereo Mix"" recording device-
Save
Restart VLC
Play Music


Step 4)

On your RaspberryPi:


In XBMC navigate to Music -> Playlists
Select VLC.strm (or whatever you called it)
ENJOY MUSIC!


Troubleshooting

If you have troubles getting your ""Stereo Mix"" to work or capture, play around in Windows first by e.g. recording it with Audacity and trying some forum suggestions

But if I do that, I think the current through the switch would then be zero? And then the switch would be considered ""off?"" Or maybe I could arbitrarily define the current through the switch as being from either the left or right hand side circuits? But that seems to be not possible because originally the switch was shared between both of the circuits.

Can someone figure out what is wrong with my reasoning? What should the current through the circuit be in the ""on"" position?

3073,3073,4892,Why does this sequence converges to $\pi$?,"One of my daughters was having a small programming exercise. 

Let's consider following algorithm:


Take a list of length $n$: $\ (1\,\ 2\,\ \ldots\,\ n)$.
Remove every $2$nd number.
From the resulting list, remove every $3$rd number.
From the resulting list, remove every $4$th number.
... Follow on until the list remains unchanged and let $u_n$ be the number of remaining elements.


Example with $n=11$


$(\ 1\,\ 2\,\ 3\,\ 4\,\ 5\,\ 6\,\ 7\,\ 8\,\ 9\,\ 10\,\ 11\ )\quad \Rightarrow\quad (\ 1\ *\ 3\ *\ 5\ *\ 7\ *\ 9 \ *\ 11\ )$

$(\ 1\, 3\,\ 7\,\ 9\ )\quad \Rightarrow\quad (\ 1\,\ 3\,\ 7\ *\ )$
$(\ 1\,\ 3\,\ 7\ )\ $ -- will not be modified anymore, and therefore $u_n=3$.

",Ali Taghavi,https://mathoverflow.net/users/36688,"Since $\mathbb R^2$ has one end and $\mathbb R^1$ has two ends, a proper map $\mathbb R^2 \to \mathbb R^1$ must send the end of $\mathbb R^2$ to one of the two ends of $\mathbb R^1$ - that is, $f(x,y)$ is either a large positive number of a large negative number when $(x,y)$ is large.

But we can force $\nabla \cdot gX$ to oscillate  arbitrarily many times. Choose a vector field like $ \sin(x^2+y^2)( xdx + ydy)$.

5987,5987,9491,Would it be a problem if all Amazon links were converted to affiliate links?,"I'm thinking that one way Jeff and the Stack Overflow team could squeeze some extra money out of this site would be to automatically convert all Amazon links posted here into affiliate links, e.g. Stick ""tag=codinghorror-20"" (or more likely a new site-specific tag) onto every Amazon link.

",guy16,https://stackoverflow.com/users/4862605,"You've got multiple problems here.

First, if you write this in the middle of a class definition:

valCouche = nameCouche()


... you're creating a class attribute, which is shared by all instances, not a normal instance attribute.

Also, you're running this at class definition time. That means there is no self yet--there aren't any instances yet to be self--so you can't call a method like nameCouche, because you don't have anything to call it on.

What you want to do is call the method at instance initialization time, on the instance being initialized, and store the return value in an instance attribute:

def __init__(self):
    self.valCouche = self.nameCouche()


Then, when you want to access this value in another method later, you have to access it as self.valCouche.



If you make those changes, it will work. But your object model still doesn't make much sense. Why is nameCouche a method when it doesn't have anything to do with the object, and doesn't access any of its attributes? Maybe it makes sense as a @staticmethod, but really, I think it makes more sense just as a plain function outside the class. In fact, none of the code you've written seems to have anything to do with the class. 

This kind of cram-everything-into-the-class design is often a sign that you're trying to write Java code in Python, and haven't yet really understood how Python does OO. You might want to read a good tutorial on Python classes. But briefly: if you're writing a class just to have somewhere to dump a bunch of vaguely-related functions, what you want is a module, not a class. If you have some reason to have instances of that class, and the functions all act on the data of each instance, then you want a class.

This is what i'm getting



The x-axes is showing wrong values, as you can see from the picture above. 

But console.log(chart_data.x_axes) gives 
[""Day 1"", ""Day 2"", ""Day 3""] which should be the correct x-axes label.

Please let me know how can i fix this x-axes label error.

1236,1236,1937,Nexus 4 does not wake up from Sleep randomly,"I have a Nexus 4 running stock rom kit kat 4.4.2. There were few instances, in which when the phone goes to sleep, I see the notification light blinking indicating a new email/message, but it doesn't wake up when I press the power button. I have to soft reboot the phone {press the power button for 5 seconds to turn it off, then turn on}to use it again. This happens more frequently on some days, and some times it doesn't happen for weeks.I tried calling the phone from my land line when it is in this state, I could hear it ringing on the landline, but the phone doesn't actually ring. After rebooting, it doesn't even show a missed call. When I reboot it, the phone's battery is substantially less (down by about 10%). It started happening only since 4.3 JB update, it was fine till then.

I tried a full factory reset, and minimal apps, it worked fine. Once I installed all my apps back, this started happening again. I am thinking one of my apps is causing this and it could be an application or a bug in Kit kat/JB itself.


Is there any known bug in kitkat 4.4.2 (or >= 4.3 ) or is there any application known to cause this?
Is there any way I can look at the logs to see if any specific application is causing this.

Another approach would be, as you already indicated:


start with a factory reset. You know that with a ""fresh device"" the issue does not happen, as described by your question
install back only a part of your apps (the ones you feel most essential), but not more than ~50%. See if the issue still happens.

No: the problematic app was not in this batch

starting over with factory-reset and installing the first half of your apps.
split the other half in two again, and repeat as above


This procedure should help you finding the culprit, while still being able to use your device and as much of your apps as possible.

Thus, the side length of the square field is $(600-6x)/4=150-\frac32x$, so its area is $22500-450x+\frac94x^2$, and the total area is $$A(x)=22500-450x+\frac{17}4x^2,$$ as desired.

We know in particular that we need $2x^2\geq 800$, from which $x\geq 20$ (since $x$ is positive). Also, since the square field needs area at least $100$ square feet, then its side length is at least $10$ feet, meaning $150-\frac32x\geq 10,$ from which $x\leq\frac{280}3$, as desired.

As for the last part, observe that the graph of $A(x)$ is a portion of a parabola that opens up. This will necessarily be maximized at one of its endpoints (if it opened down, it might maximize at its vertex, if in the domain). It is easy to check which of $x=20$ or $x=\frac{280}3$ maximizes $A(x)$, and what that maximum area is.

5224,5224,8303,Does Clark Kent have a weight problem?,"This question came to mind while watching an overloaded vehicle tilting down the road ahead of me. Are Kryptonians Height &amp; Weight Proportional (H/W/P) to humans? I'm curious to know if Clark has to fly (hover just a little bit) in order to adjust his weight and level load a cars suspension system so he blends in when he travels with earthlings in automobiles. 
",Major Stackings,https://scifi.stackexchange.com/users/4356,"No, Clark Kent doesn't have a weight problem. But he should. Superman has since the late sixties been portrayed as having the height and weight proportions of a normal human male, despite his superhuman strength. 

DC Comics has not bothered to address this issue with Superman in any of the previous iterations of the Man of Steel. He has almost always been listed around 6 to 6.5 feet tall weighing approximately 225 - 250 pounds, sometimes a bit more.


Scientifically speaking Clark Kent, indeed all Kryptonians should weigh, at least a bit  more, and have a greater molecular weight than normal humans. Coming from a world which was supposedly significantly larger, they would have to have been much stronger to maintain their human-like appearance.
His strength, since the Golden Age has not depended on his arrival from a heavy gravity planet, and in many iterations, Krypton is not even considered a heavy gravity world. In those cases, Superman's superhuman strength is strictly a product of his solar-powered infusion/conversion of energy into superhuman strength and his other powers.
No, this has not been portrayed consistently; particularly during periods where Kal-el might lose his powers or during the period as Superman Blue/Red when he had no superhuman strength at all.
In the Marvel Universe, for example, the Asgardians to partially compensate for their superhuman strength (even a normal Asgardian can lift ten tons) have three times the bone, muscle and overall tissue density of normal humans. Yes, in the case of some Asgardians they have even greater strength, but we assume there is a magical component for those who are lifting far in excess of that.


None of this makes strict sense and with multiple versions of Krypton, Superman, writer and editor inconsistency, it is not surprising the details have gotten lost or glossed over. Just look at the modifications for the planet Krypton over the decades:


  
  Krypton and its history has been altered to a great extent from its previous versions. In the post-Crisis Krypton, sexual reproduction was considered obscene, and thus, all children were conceived in birthing matrices. After Infinite Crisis, this was taken out of Kryptonian culture. 
  Also in post-Crisis Krypton, this planet was located in a solar system within the Milky Way galaxy close enough that the radiation from the explosion (traveling only at light speed) was able to reach Earth (Action #600). 
  But after Superman: Birthright it was suggested that the planet Krypton was from an entirely different galaxy. In current continuity however, Krypton has been revised back to its previous position and is confirmed to be in the sector of space that borders that of Earth.
  The Green Lanterns have dubbed Krypton's sector of space 2813 (Earth's being 2814) and was under the protection of Green Lantern Tomar-Re when it was destroyed. Another element to the previous version of Krypton was that all Kryptonians were unable to leave their planet or they would die instantly. This was a result of the Eradicator altering the genetic codes of Kryptonians to keep them planet-bound after a group of them left Krypton to explore and colonize other planets. The Eradicator punished these Kryptonians by altering their genetic codes to be vulnerable to lead, which resulted in the Daxamites.
  Originally, Jor-El had a serum that he invented that would allow a Kryptonian to leave the planet safely; which he gave to his son Kal-El upon leaving for Earth. This was created to maintain the rule of Superman being the only Kryptonian survivor which was the theme of the post-Crisis Superman mythos. 
  This was reversed after 2003 when it was revealed that Superboy (Conner Kent) was half Kryptonian and then in 2004 when Supergirl (Kara Zor-El) arrived on Earth. The Eradicator did not place the planet-bound restrictions on the Krypton of the current DC universe but it still seems to be responsible for the Daxamites' lead vulnerability.
  The Krypton of the current continuity was at one time an expanding empire that conquered other planets for years but was dismantled after the Kryptonian high council decided that their methods were too aggressive. The city of Kandor had a lunar city named after the planet bound city and when the lunar colony was destroyed, Brainiac kidnapped the real Kandor.
  Other multi-ethnic versions of Kryptonians that resemble African-Americans and Asians also make an appearance in current continuity. Though previously, ""black"" Kryptonians were mainly confined within the Kryptonian continent of Vathlo Island. In the New Earth continuity, dark-skinned Kryptonians are more integrated into Kryptonian society than they were in the silver and pre-modern age DC universe.

5128,5128,8158,Drywall - final joint compound coat,"While remodeling an older house (where nothing is quite straight) we used fiber glass mesh joint tape and 3 coats of joint compound. The first coat was applied with a 4 inch knife, the second with an 8 inch and ending the third on a 12 inch knife. I can still see the texture from the mesh tape I used on some of the joints.

I hoped that a coat of primer would level it off, but after using Kilz 2 primer I can still see the tape in some spots. :(

Sanding through the primer now proves difficult (doesn't work) with a medium grit sanding block.

Should I add another coat? I could never quite get the joint compound to adhere over the mesh tape. I've always been taught to go as thin as I can on the joint compound to reduce the sanding part. Did I go too thin? 

I'm hoping a second coat of primer and 2 coats of the final latex paint hides it, but I know this isn't the right answer. How can I fix this?



following what doresoom and shirlock said; i just applied a coat with the 12 inch knife practically against the wall (accidentally touching the wall with the handle once or twice) - more or less dragging the compound across the surface

this produced the result explained - about 1/32nd ? thickness of mud, covering the tape that i'll need to feather round the edges

i miss spoke earlier - i was using a sponge sanding block (not strait paper sand paper)

now that the primer has dried (did it saturday) its not as bad as i thought it was, but this is the right way to do it (not covering it with paint)

just as a side, we've used sherwin williams paint throughout the house and although its great paint (IMO) the plaster and lath walls that remain, even those repairs show through - and if those do, than this new work will... may as well do finish it right...

thanks for the help guys - i'll check this coat tomorrow and give a last one with the soap and water if it needs it.
",lsiunsuex,https://diy.stackexchange.com/users/1154,"I know this isn't the answer you want to hear, but I don't think priming and painting will hide the tape. 

Before you apply any more primer, I'd add another thicker coat of mud. Slather on the mud thick first - it doesn't have to be smooth. Then smooth it out by angling your 12"" knife so it's almost parallel with the drywall as you drag it along the surface. You'll have to press fairly firmly in order to avoid air gaps appearing in the thick coat you're smoothing out.

You may have to get a feel for it. If you push too hard and can see the tape again, redo that section until you get it just right.

Wait for the thicker coat to dry, then sand the edges as smooth as you can get them. Very carefully/lightly sand over area covering the tape if you didn't get it quite smooth. You may need to do a second coat along both sides of the thicker coat to make it join the drywall surface smoothly.

1242,1242,1952,Why are two eigen-state-kets with different eigenvalues orthogonal?,"The operators $J_1^2$, $J_2^2$, $J_{1z}$, and $J_{2z}$ are mutually commuting operators. Likewise, $J_1^2$, $J_2^2$, $J^2$, and $J_z$ are mutually commuting operators.  The two groups are incompatible, and the simultaneous eigenkets along with their eigenvalues are given by:

${J_1}^2 \left|j_1,j_2;m_1,m_2\right&gt; = j_1 \left(j_1+1\right) \hbar^2 \left|j_1,j_2;m_1,m_2\right&gt;$

$J_{1z} \left|j_1,j_2;m_1,m_2\right&gt; = m_1 \hbar \left|j_1,j_2;m_1,m_2\right&gt;$
$J_{2z} \left|j_1,j_2;m_1,m_2\right&gt; = m_2 \hbar \left|j_1,j_2;m_1,m_2\right&gt;$

and

${J_1}^2 \left|j_1,j_2;j,m\right&gt; = j_1 \left(j_1+1\right) \hbar^2 \left|j_1,j_2;j,m\right&gt;$

$J^2 \left|j_1,j_2;j,m\right&gt; = j \left(j+1\right) \hbar^2 \left|j_1,j_2;j,m\right&gt;$
$J_z \left|j_1,j_2;j,m\right&gt; = m \hbar \left|j_1,j_2;j,m\right&gt;$

I read that each set of eigenkets are mutually orthogonal [1] (for eigenkets corresponding to different sets of eigenvalues).  This is what I don't understand.  In principle it makes sense, but when I plug in numbers I don't get zero for the inner product.  For example take the first eigenket: $\left|j_1,j_2;m_1,m_2\right&gt;$.  If I choose different eigenvalues for this eigenket (e.g. let $j_1 = 0$ and then let $j_1 = 1$) I get the following:

for $j_1 = 0$ I can have:
$\left|0,j_2;0,m_2\right&gt;$

for $j_1 = 1$ I can have any of the following, since $\left|m_1\right| \leq j_1$:
$\left|1,j_2;-1,m_2\right&gt;$
$\left|1,j_2;0,m_2\right&gt;$
$\left|1,j_2;1,m_2\right&gt;$  

If I take the inner-product of the $j_1 = 0$ eigenket with any of the $j_1 = 1$ eigenkets I do not get zero, e.g.:

$\left&lt;0,j_2;0,m_2 \mid 1,j_2;-1,m_2\right&gt; = {j_2}^2+{m_2}^2$  

which is non-zero unless $j_2 = 0$.  

What am I misunderstanding here? How do you show that eigenkets with different eigenvalues are orthogonal?

2249,2249,3586,Is it possible to get a popup to ignore MenuDropAlignment in a WPF / Touch app?,"As a bit of background - Windows has a facility for Touch/TabletPCs whereby it shifts the position of popups/menus depending on your ""handedness"" (to prevent the menu appearing under your hand). 

Essentially what this does is if you are set to ""right handed"" (which it seems to default to once you've connected a touch device), every popup you open is artificially kicked to the left - this causes massive layout issues where we try and line up a popup with the item it ""popped up from"" :

Tablet PC Settings set to Left handed - no artificial correction from Windows


Tablet PC Settings set to Right handed - Windows artificially adjusts our positioning


We can detect what this setting is set to with SystemParameters.MenuDropAlignment, and for trivial popups we can adjust this using the actual width of the popup - but for dynamic popups and when we throw right to left support into the mix, this just doesn't work.

Currently it's looking more likely that we are going to have to go through every popup, manually work out a value to adjust the kick, and add something like this to every one:

&lt;MultiDataTrigger&gt;
    &lt;MultiDataTrigger.Conditions&gt;
        &lt;Condition Binding=""{Binding Source={x:Static SystemParameters.MenuDropAlignment}}"" Value=""True""/&gt;
        &lt;Condition Binding=""{Binding RelativeSource={RelativeSource Mode=Self}, Path=FlowDirection}"" Value=""RightToLeft""/&gt;
    &lt;/MultiDataTrigger.Conditions&gt;
    &lt;MultiDataTrigger.Setters&gt;
        &lt;Setter Property=""HorizontalOffset"" Value=""-50""/&gt; &lt;!-- Set to arbitrary value to test --&gt;
    &lt;/MultiDataTrigger.Setters&gt;
&lt;/MultiDataTrigger&gt;


So.. back to the question :-) Does anyone know of a way to stop a WPF popup looking at this setting at all? 

For those that don't have a touch device you can access the Tablet PC settings by running:

C:\Windows\explorer.exe shell:::{80F3F1D5-FECA-45F3-BC32-752C152E456E}

5687,5687,9015,Can Noether's theorem be understood intuitively?,"Noether's theorem is one of those surprisingly clear results of mathematical calculations, for which I am inclined to think that some kind of intuitive understanding should or must be possible. However I don't know of any, do you?

Independence of time &lt;=> energy conservation.
Independence of position &lt;=> momentum conservation.
Independence of direction &lt;=> angular momentum conservation.  

I know that the mathematics leads in the direction of Lie-algebra and such but I would like to discuss whether this theorem can be understood from a non-mathematical point of view also.
",Gerard,https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/139,"It's intuitively clear that the energy most accurately describes how much the state of the system is changing with time. So if the laws of physics don't depend on time, then the amount how much the state of the system changes with time has to be conserved because it's still changing in the same way.

In the same way, and perhaps even more intuitively, if the laws don't depend on position, you may hit the objects, and hit them a little bit more, and so on. The momentum measures how much the objects depend on space, so if the laws themselves don't depend on the position on space, the momentum has to be conserved.

The angular momentum with respect to an axis is determining how much the state changes if you rotate it around the axis - how much it depends on the angle (therefore ""angular"" in the name). So the symmetry is linked to the conservation law once again. 

If your intuition doesn't find the comments intuitive enough, maybe you should train your intuition because your current intuition apparently misses the most important properties of time, space, angles, energy, momentum, and angular momentum. ;-)

5991,5991,9498,Is my interval training routine effective for mountain bike training?,"During these winter months I am currently attending the gym 3 times a week. On each of the days I start my training on an exercise bike with the following:


5 minute warm up
30 minutes, 1 minute hard, 1 minute recovery
5 minute warm down


I am using a specific interval training setting on the bike. I preset the training to level 15, which is a high resistance and as much as I can take.

Hard is a cadence of between 80-90rpm high resistance. Recovery is a cadence of 60prm and the resistance backs off considerably, I imagine to approximately level 7.

My heart rate towards the end of the session reaches 170–190bpm, and I am working flat-out. I turn 30 in March, am 5' 8"" and weigh approx 168lbs.

Does this training routine seem sensible for building strength and speed on the mountain? Should I be changing up the training with other types of bike training?

It is also worth noting that after the interval training I perform free weight strength training too.
",DigiKev,https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/users/3323,"I think there are several issues with your approach for improving power on bike:


doing the same workout stresses the same aerobic pathway, since there are several ways your body can burn fuel it is worth exercising all of them. This means doing intervals of different length with different rest periods. Example: 3x(12+6) min on and off. The on part is similar to what you can do for 1 hour and the off part is half of that. Another example: 3x(3+3) min on and off where the on part is what you can do for 5 minutes, off part is half of that.
the intervals do not seem to be anaerobic, because of the short recovery period( anaerobic intervals need longer recovery periods ). They are either Vo2Max intervals or Threshold. If they are Vo2Max I think the workout is too hard, usually accumulating 6 to 9 minutes at Vo2Max in a training session is too much, if they are threshold I don't think the approach is very good, better go with a longer interval period since threshold power can be usually sustained by riders for 30 to 60 minutes.
if you want to endure in long events/rides you need to do longer sessions to have the endurance
heart rate on an indoor trainer seems to be artificially high for me, I think it is because of the poor ventilation. Also power on the trainer is much lower then going outside, so pacing with heart rate on an indoor trainer seems to be a bad idea at least this is my experience. Suppose your 170bpm is upper tempo power, on an  indoor trainer that might be actually upper endurance because of the artificial high heart rate.
for effective mountain biking you also need riding skills, these are not developed on a trainer.


I would try to look at the requirements of your specific events and target those, also try to do longer sessions on the trail to build the endurance needed to complete this events.

An alternate way is to get a generic mountain biking endurance plan and build on that, it won't be perfect but I think is much superior over what you have now.

Also, try to ride outside if possible, the workouts are better and you will enjoy the training much more.

320,320,514,iCal Google Sync -- how to get rid of folders (delegates)?,"I've got my calendars in Google, but when I sync them with iCal I get all these ugly folders. How can I clean this up?


",JCBK,https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/5088,"Short Answer: You cannot easily clean that up.

Long Answer:  When you have delegate calendars, that typically means that you are given permission to view (maybe edit) someone else's calendar.  This is why there is special interface to deal with delegation and they are grouped in their own section of the calendar list.

Behind the scenes, google treats each calendar you create as its own principal (almost like its own account), so iCal treats all the non default calendars as delegates.  To confuse things further, you can actually can share google calendars so iCal could never tell the difference between an actual shared calendar and new calendar you added.  

The only solution is to move all your events into the default calendar or move your calendars to a service which handles multiple calendars in a better way (Yahoo, Exchange, iCalServer)

But rather than how to get and/or look for internships, my questions concerns of how to filter companies looking for free labor to do their website VS companies that might not offer a paid check, but it will offer you mentorship and skills.

I have a cousin that is a college freshman and she is looking for Sofware development internships, but at this point, she is desperately looking for any internship that is IT related. Besides the big software names and elite small software shops, How do you recognize a good internships in non-it-companies(large or small) doing IT maintenance vs the bad ones? If you don't have work experience, what questions a college student should ask to prevent ripoff? Are there any red flags that you can spot before accepting an offer?
",Armando,https://programmers.stackexchange.com/users/24962,"Fair warning - in my opinion, her biggest detriment is years of college experience.  While it's quite true that you can be a great programmer and be a college freshman - big companies with established internship programs that offer the kind of things you are speaking of typically have a set of hardened criteria for reviewing applicants.  One of them is years of college experience and most companies don't readily accept interns that are freshman - the earliest is usually after Sophomore year.

This is partially because interns - even if they are free - are an investment.  They need computers, space to work, and the time of a senior person to supervise them.  The cost of this has to be weighed against the value the intern will bring to the team.  IMO - most interns are a good deal, but you can't take everyone so a company has to find some set of criteria.

So, knowing your cousin is a freshman tells me that if she wants a technical internship, she's already going to have to get creative - it's time to start using every under-the-wire resource and personal connection.  You'll want to maximize your contact with people who will see working with her as a plus - and that's a heck of a lot easier with people who know your cousin.

The other venue that is ALWAYS worth maximizing is her college's internship system.  Most colleges have internal internship job boards where the college and the internship providers have worked together to build a set of opportunities for students.  In these cases, the companies realize that they need to give interns a good opportunity.

I'm assuming that at this point, though, your cousin has tried everything and she's really scrounging - going to just about every job board and trying just about every opportunity.  Assuming she gets an interview, she'll want to remember that interviewing is as much about checking out the company as it is about showing potential.  Here's some things I'd look for when going on an internship interview (now that I'm well past my intern years and I know from the other side exactly what a manager can do with an intern!).  I'm keeping it broad as IT is a heck of a lot more than just software work!


What will I be working on? - good signs are work that involve either making things work or verifying that they are working.  Bad signs are doing paperwork while other people make things work.  Having to service customer problems (front line tech support) isn't all bad, it may all she can snag, but if that's the case, she should be getting paid.
Who will I be working for?  - preferably it's someone on the interview list or someone on the interview list is ""sample manager"" - ie a manager who needs interns, but the company may assign the candidate to a similar but different manager in the end - it's just that managers have to handle pools of interviews and often matchmaking is done later on.  Ask this manager what they expect from an intern and what they are willing to give.  Good signs are ""I expect you to take responsibility"", ""I expect you to ask lots of questions"", ""I expect you'll keep me appraised of your status"", ""I expect that by the end of the internship you'll be able to take on a 3-4 week chunk of work and work with minimal assistance"".  Bad signs are - ""you'll follow me around and do exactly what I tell you"", or ""I won't have time to give much guidance, and I don't have anyone that can help, we'll have to figure it out as we go"".
How big is the technical team? - hopefully it's a team of 5-10 people with varying degrees of expertise, with at least a few senior people.  Also - how much time will the senior people have to spare to answer questions?  Good = 15 minutes a day, with a known rampup of longer than that early on.  Bad = ""what senior people?""  or ""it's just you"".
What are the major goals of the team?  What are the key ingredients to success on this project?  - this is my particular way (when I do volunteer work) of figuring out whether I've found people I can work with.  If it takes 20 minutes to answer this question, we have a failure.  Even if I am working alone, with a non-technical person, I may learn a lot of good stuff.  But that requires that the people I'm working with have a real clue of what they want to get done.  It's amazing how many people really don't know what the problem they are trying to solve is, or what qualifies as a solution.  Without that core vision, no matter how technical the team is, it's likely that the internship will be frustrating.


All that said - seriously - don't feel awful if an internship doesn't happen in the summer of Freshman year.  I had pretty great grades, 3 languages under my belt and a programmer mother and I STILL didn't swing an internship my Freshman summer.

4484,4484,7110,What's the best way to scan in hundreds of pictures?,"I have thousands of old pictures which were sitting in a photo album. Unfortunately, instead of the photo album protecting the pictures, the plastic coverings yellowed, and the pictures themselves had to be carefully extracted from the books. There is also quite a bit of powdered paper (the backings on the books pretty much fell apart while we extracted the pictures), and the fronts of the images are still a bit sticky.

These pictures are 30+ years old, are often extremely faded, and were originally taken on (what I think is) ""110 film"" -- they are approximately 2.5"" squares.

Anyway, I need to scan all these images in to preserve them from further decay. Unfortunately, it's taking forever -- going through less than 100 images took an entire day, even if one discounts any time spent in Photoshop trying to remove some of the photo album's artifacts on the images.

What I really need is some method of scanning the images in faster. Most automated solutions aren't going to work because they accept 4x6s as their smallest image size, and even if that was not the case, the adhesives still stuck to the prints would probably ruin any such device in 5 seconds flat.

6054,6054,9609,"Sharing JavaScript model code between server and client, is this approach valid?","I'm beginning learning Node.js and Backbone. I'd like to share some code between the server and the client (related to [1] and [2]). More in deep:


Share defaults values for a model. Defaults are used to populate forms (client-side), while they are enforced server-side
Share validation rules in order to be DRY and perform client/server validation
Share instance methods


So my idea is to use a factory object to encapsulate common code (defaults, validation rules, public instance methods) and adapt the factory object based on the environment (Node.js or AMD module).

This code is quick&amp;dirty and may not work. Is this a good approach or just a waste of time?

(function (factory) {
    if (typeof exports === 'object') { // Node.js

If I sample it, (replacing t=nTs , Ts = sampling period and n represent number of samples) and plotting the sampled signals with a different sampling period using the subplot command in MATLAB, how could I identify the aliasing in a sampled signal?

Here is the example code that plotted two signals, one at the Nyquist rate while the other less than the Nyquist rate:

Fmax = 10;
Fs = 2*Fmax;
n = 0:1/Fs:1;

By normalizing the sinusoid frequency by Fs you are implicitly assuming that the sample unit is 1/Fs seconds.

2163,2163,3449,How do I deal with a slow and undedicated colleague in the team?,"I have been working on a new project. The project works like this: The end user can access a webapp using a link and he can add multiple systems on his network and manage that particular systems details. My part involves the front end and the webserver, which is done in python. My python actually communicates with another project which is entirely done in c &amp; c++. The c/c++ project is the main app which does all the functionality. My python sends the user request to it and displays the response from it to the user. 

I am very familiar with my work and I will finish it soon. Since that's not much work in it. And I am a person who loves to work. I spends most of the time in office and only go home when I feel sleepy.

The c/c++ app is managed by another colleague who has 5+ year experience and can do things much faster than me, but he never does it. May be he doesn't like to do it. His app crashes often when my python communicate with it or returns wrong values. It's full of bugs. Since my app depends on it, I am having a hard time building it. Instead of fixing the bugs, he asks me to slow down my work. He asks me to tell manager that my work needs a lot of time. He is asking me to fool the manager and even forcing me to work slowly like him.

During project meeting, when manager asks him about the bugs he says that he fixed everything and it works fine. Since he is my colleague, I couldn't tell anything to the manager. I obviously need to have a good relationship with my colleagues more than my manager, since most of the time we will be with our colleagues, not with the manager.

I am not able to tell the manager anything regarding this, since if manager asks him why, then he may think I complained about him to the manager. And he keeps on lying in the meeting. And since he fixes the bug slowly, it even slows down my work. Now I thought of working on the front-end part of my app  and finishing it off so that in the mean time he can make his project stable. Now he is asking me to tell the manager that my front end part require a lot of work and I may need more and more time, simply so that he can drag the project down. And the sad thing is our actual manager has gone to the US, so we have a temporary manager and this guy doesn't know about the project much, so the c,c++ just fools him.

Can anyone suggest me how I deal with this?
I wanted to finish off the project soon. How can I make him work even by maintaining a good relationship with him?

Responses to comments:


  If he's really deliberately misleading the company, you should report him to management.


I am new to this company and the other guy has been there for many years. And I have just started knowing my colleagues. If I directly go and complaint him, I don't think so I can make good relationship with my other colleagues. Even he has the power to mislead them. I am not telling he is a bad guy, he can do the work, but he is not doing it.


  Doesn't your company have any kind of bug tracking system ? 


Here actual bug tracking system isn't there. The company tries to finish off the project as soon as possible and gives it to the QA. And then fixes the bugs reported by QA. 


  This is why companies should give employees stock / options or some sort of ownership. That way you can literally tell the guy ""You are costing me monetary growth... don't you want to make money also?"".


The company has the stock options they have given me a 2500 share, mostly he too would have got some more.


  Seniority does deserve some benefit of a doubt. You really need to speak to him first and try to understand the problem. He may be out of his depth, you may be able to help him, there could easily be variables you are unaware of. It may be hard now, but you could easily make the situation a lot worse by jumping the gun. 


I even does it, first his app wasn't handling multiple requests at a time, he was using a queue to handle the requests I sent to him. I even suggested to him some of my ideas on it. He said he already had these ideas, and will be executing them. His explanations was: ""Everything require certain time to do and this is a project which may need two years to complete and we are asked to finish it in two months"". I used to have a hard time coding during first few weeks because of this bug. But now he fixed it. But he is using a single queue for a user requests and that is now slowing down the app, since it processes one request at a time.


  What is QA doing this whole time? Why aren't they reporting/confirming the status of the project(s)? 


The manager is the person who decides when to give to the QA. As of now it has not yet given to QA. He said we should give it by this month end.

1455,1455,2291,AES 256 Encryption - Is it really easy to decrypt if you have the key?,"So this might sound like a crazy question but bear with me for a minute. I can't find any info on the internet and so am here, although this might have been a good place to start.

I've recently developed an encryption engine using the .net's AES managed classes. I use a 256 bit key generated by the Rfc2898DeriveBytes function. The key is generated from a pass phrase that is at least 40 characters long. The IV is also generated from this pass phrase. The encryption class uses a CypherMode of CBC and a padding mode of PKCS7. There is a static salt that is 8 bytes long. 

The key is stored in a separate database to the data and is itself encrypted using a certificate based on the database master key.

So, my question is: is it really easy to decrypt the data if the attacker has the key? I'm not talking about the Chinese government (or even GHCQ given recent headlines), I'm talking about an attacker who steals both databases. 

What would be the steps they have to follow and/or how can I stop them on their path? The reason I ask this is that I want to know how feasible it is. Is it something that can be done in minutes or does it fall into the bracket of being infeasible? Do they have to calculate all of the parameters used when encrypting?
",bhs,https://crypto.stackexchange.com/users/7684,"
  So to clarify then the question would be this: The attacker has the encrypted data and the plain text key and no other knowledge. How easy is it to decrypt the data and why.


As I understand it, modern ciphers can't be broken knowing just the ciphertext (and no other information). But, the cipher algorithym (eg. AES) is only one part of a wider system using RNGs, keys, salts, IVs, padding, signatures, certificates, and so on. People have developed amazing exploits against tiny deficiencies in how those parts all fit together. So even though the ciper itself is secure, that does not mean that the system as a whole is secure.

Here's a simple analogue. SCUBA tanks have a threaded hole where the valve screws in. Some of those holes use a ""3/4 NPS"" thread, others use an ""M25"" thread. An M25 valve will screw ""perfectly"" into a 3/4 NPS hole - but those two threads aren't quite the same. Result: the valve can explode from the tank when it is pressurized. Each component is fine on its own; they seem to fit together correctly; an amateur won't see any problem; but the resultant system can fail catastrophically.

Crypto's the same!

4254,4254,6782,Potentiometer protection circuitry,"My question arose from my previous question about a wind direction measuring circuit.
Please have a look at the manual: http://www.fondriest.com/pdf/rm_young_05103_manual.pdf
And here is the figures about my questions:


In Figure A, the potentiometer is used to output voltage proportional to the wind vane rotation angle.

In Figure B, the potentiometer comes to an end at point 1 and causes a short between the lines WHT(wind excitation voltage) and GRN(wind direction signal). But in theory current flows from + to ground. Do you think there is a path for current to flow in Figure B?

In Figure C, it seems like the situation is safe. Although the lines GRN and BLK are shorted at point 2, there is no potential difference and no current flows. Is that right?

My real confusion is about D6 and D7 the transzorb diodes(zener clampers?). I couldn’t really figure out in which circumstances they function and what happens in the absence of them. Why do we really need them? 

In the manual it states: “To prevent false readings, signal conditioning electronics should clamp the signal to excitation or reference level when this occurs.” Do you think one needs an extra circuitry at the output?
",user16307,https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/16307,"The transzorbs are there to protect your electronics from induced voltages on the cables.

2160,2160,3444,Unusual Differential Equation,"I have the differential equation

$$y''y+n(y')^2=0\tag 1$$

I haven't found any references to equations of this type by searching.  Does anyone have a suggestion as to how to proceed?

It comes about from the following progression:

$$y=(y')^n-\frac 1n\tag 2\\
y'=ny''(y')^{n-1}\implies1=ny''(y')^{n-2}\\
0=n(n-2)(y'')^2(y')^{n-3}+ny'''(y')^{n-2}\\
0=(n-2)(y'')^2+y'''y'$$

Taking $y$ in place of $y'$ and $n$ in place of $n-2$ I get the form shown in $(1)$.  Are there any good ways to solve any of the other intermediate forms, or even the initial form shown in $(2)$?

Further constraints:

$y(0)\approx 1.27$ is an otherwise-unknown constant that I am attempting to build an expression for.

The initial problem is the recurrence relation with $a_1\approx 1.27$ the unknown constant and

$$a_{n+1}=(a_n)^{n+1}-\frac 1{n+1}$$

with the additional constraint $\lim_{n\to\infty}a_n=1$.

A trilogy of trilogies

It was widely reported in 1980 that there would be nine films: a trilogy of trilogies.

Al Walentis wrote in the May 25, 1980 Reading Eagle:


  Lucas originally envisioned ""Star Wars"" as a single feature, but his 200-page screenplay proved too unwieldy. He then began tinkering with his story line, cutting it apart, sorting our all the various subplots. The script finally was pieced together as three distinct trilogies. 
  
  ""There are essentially nine films,"" Lucas said. ""The first trilogy is about the young Ben Kenobi and the early life of Luke Skywalker's father when Luke was a young boy. The first trilogy takes place some 20 years before the second. About a year elapses between each story of the first trilogy. The whole adventure - encompassing the three trilogies - spans about 40 years.""


Irvin Kershner, director of The Empire Strikes Back (1980), was also on-script with the nine-film plan. Tom Buckley of the N.Y. Times wrote on May 25, 1980's The Spokesman-Review:


  ""I told George I didn't want to do a sequel,"" Kershner said.""He said, 'I don't blame you. Neither would I, but this isn't. It's the second act of the second trilogy of nine films I plan to make in this theme. I want it to be better than mine.' ...""

Recently, I had something like KQxxxxx, and a side queen (I forget how the other suits were distributed but was told it didn't matter). My partner was disappointed I didn't ""preempt"" (in ""third"" seat). My response was ""with seven points?""

My understanding is that people often bid three of a suit with seven cards and this little. Sometimes even less, particularly when non-vulnerable vs. vulnerable. In its extreme version, the mantra is ""with any seven (suited) cards.""

Isn't this risky? What if we're doubled and only make three or four tricks?
",Tom Au,https://boardgames.stackexchange.com/users/1344,"Your response of ""With 7 points?"" makes me think you have some misconceptions about the hands the you ought to preempt on. (As an aside, I am really curious: What do you preempt on?). 

One normally preempts on highly offensive hands, which when played in any suit other than your long suit will offer very little defense. The position also is relevant, as in third seat you can really be aggressive in your preempts, opposite a passed hand. The vulnerability and scoring also matters: at IMPS going down 3 doubled, non-vul (-500) against a making vul game is (-600) is a great sacrifice.

Don't look at the total hcp, but look at your suit length and how offensive your hand is.

So a hand like Jxxxxxx, Kx , Qx, Kx (9 hcp) is not a hand to prempt (it offers nice defense and is less offensive oriented), but you should preempt on a hand like KQTxxxx, x, xxx, xx (only 5 hcp).

With KQTxxxx as trumps, assuming partner holds 2 small trumps, you rate to take 5-6 tricks on average. If partner also has an outside A, you will take 6-7 tricks, which is a great bargain (going down 2 or 3) against opponents making game/slam, especially when vul.

The usual point of preempting is that you rate to take away opponent's bidding space, as well as pointing the way to partner in making a sacrifice over opponents game/slam bid.

Ultimately, like with any other bidding situation, it is a risk vs reward + partnership discipline scenario and if you don't go for a number sometimes, you are not preempting enough.

591,591,919,"OSX ssh-agent: no password pasting, and problem with PKCS#8?","I use ssh on my machine, and have set up a long not-human-friendly passphrase which is saved in my password manager.
What makes me crazy every time is that I cannot paste into the window pictured below. I know the Remember password in my keychain option and use it. Sometimes I have to enter a new one though. Why can't I paste into a password field? We're in the 21th century and password managers have been invented! Apple...

Same thing for the dialog which pops up when plugging in encrypted disks.

And yes, I'd rather write a post on stack exchange than type the passphrase even once.



Some updates:


I found out how i can circumvent the stupid dialog: just use ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa, and then I can paste the passphrase into the terminal.
However, it does not work with my passphrase... using openssl rsa -text -in id_rsa I can decrypt the key without problems, but the same phrase does not get accepted by OSX's ssh-agent. My Key is encrytped using pkcs8 (read here), mattmcmanus seems to be right...
using ssh-add still not fixes the thing for encrypted disks, and my curiosity for why apple would do such something.
I answered the question regarding PKCS#8 below.

",joni,https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/41684,"
The dialog for ssh-agent can be circumvented by adding the key in the console/terminal: ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa will do the trick, you can paste the password into the terminal.
As mattmcmanus said, id_rsa encryption using PKCS seems to be broken on OSX Mavericks ssh-agent. The fast workaround is to decrypt the keyfile, and encrypt it again with the standard ssh procedure (Key-derivation method: MD5...):




mv id_rsa id_rsa.pkcs

Binary Decision Diagram (BDD):



Binary Decision Tree (BDT):



and I would like to draw them in LaTeX with TikZ. 

Furthermore, I would like to make them ""consistent"" between each other (i.e., 0-edges becomes dashed arrows in both images, the two pictures must be in black and not in grayscale, no need for the labels on the arrows of the BDD).

How can this be done ?

So far I can only make the BDT with one style of arrow, and I have absolutely no idea how to make the BDD :|

",nomis,https://tex.stackexchange.com/users/82319,"A specialised tree-drawing library or package would make this task much easier and allow you to specify the tree much more concisely. Various options are available e.g. qtree (non-TikZ), tikz-qtree (like qtree but in TikZ), forest (based on TikZ) etc.

forest is the most powerful and probably the best choice here. (But I am biased.)

\usepackage{forest}


For convenience, we set up 2 styles for the edges: my edge is the basic style with an arrow; 0 my edge is a dashed variant of my edge. We define these with \tikzset making them available both when customising the style of the BDT diagram and when tweaking it for the BDD version.

\usetikzlibrary{arrows.meta}
\tikzset{
  0 my edge/.style={densely dashed, my edge},
  my edge/.style={-{Stealth[]}},
}


We now set up a style suitable for drawing BDTs of the kind shown:

\forestset{
  BDT/.style={
    for tree={
      if n children=0{}{circle},% use a circle unless there are 0 children
      draw,% draw every node
      edge={
        my edge,% use the my edge style for edges (with the arrow)
      },
      if n=1{
        edge+={0 my edge},% if the child is the first one, add the 0 my edge style (dashed)
      }{},
      font=\sffamily,% use sans serif for node text
    }
  },
}


The BDT is then straightforward:

\begin{forest}
  BDT
  [a
    [b
      [c
        [d
          [0]
          [0]

For instructions explaining how to specify a tree in bracket notation see my explanation in this answer.

The BDD is a bit more complex and I'm not sure if I understand what is essential to the diagram and what not. Some arrows are curved, for example, but some not and I'm not always sure why.

To ensure consistency, we use the BDT style and then use two methods to tweak the code:


,phantom makes a node a 'phantom' node which affects how other nodes are spaced without being visible itself. We use these for the 'missing' nodes.
tikz={} allows you to specify TikZ code which will be run after the rest of the tree is drawn. We can use this for the arrows which skip levels. We can specify the current node using (). The other node can either be named using name= - as in the case of my one in the code below - or be specified relative to the current node by using a ! node name. In this case, we use !l1 to specify the current-node's-last-child's-first-child when drawing the arrows from a and c.


Then we can write:

\begin{forest}
  BDT
  [a, tikz={\draw [0 my edge] () [bend right] to (!l1.north) ;}
    [,phantom]
    [b, tikz={\draw [my edge] () [bend left] to (my one.north) ;}
      [c, tikz={\draw [0 my edge] () [bend right] to (!l1.north) ;}
        [,phantom]
        [d
          [0]
          [1, name=my one]
        ]
      ]
      [,phantom]
    ]
  ]
\end{forest}




If you need the line from b to be a straight vertical drop, you can adjust the tree but it is a little more complex. Since the other 'skipping' arrows are curved, I don't do this as there's no obvious reason to think it necessary.

/(&lt;img(?!.*?alt=(['""]).*?\2)[^&gt;]*)(&gt;)/


This will match an img tag anywhere in the code which either has no alt tag or an alt tag which is not followed by ="""" or ='' (i.e. invalid alt tags).

Breaking it down:

(          : open capturing group
&lt;img       : match the opening of an img tag
(?!        : open negative look-ahead
.*?        : lazy some or none to match any character
alt=(['""]) : match an 'alt' attribute followed by ' or "" (and remember which for later)
.*?        : lazy some or none to match the value of the 'alt' attribute
\2)        : back-reference to the ' or "" matched earlier
[^&gt;]*      : match anything following the alt tag up to the closing '&gt;' of the img tag
)          : close capturing group
(&gt;)        : match the closing '&gt;' of the img tag


If your code editor allows search and replace by Regex you can use this in combination with the replace string:

This will match an img tag anywhere in the code which either has no alt tag or an alt tag which is not followed by ="""" or ='' (i.e. invalid alt tags).

Breaking it down:

&lt;img       : match the opening of an img tag
(?!        : open negative look-ahead
.*?        : lazy some or none to match any character

.*?        : lazy some or none to match the value of the 'alt' attribute
\2)        : back-reference to the ' or "" matched earlier

3275,3275,5219,How are futures contracts setup at an exchange?,"I'm having a hard time wrapping my head around how the actual contracts are structured at an exchange. Here are my questions:


If an exchange facilitates the trading of futures contracts and nobody intends to take delivery of the product, nor do they own it so they can deliver it, then how are the contracts issued?  
Is there a fixed number of contracts that are created and traded, or is there an ""unlimited"" number of contracts?  
If none of the traders intend to take delivery nor do they want to deliver, then where do the sellers get the contracts to sell? How does that process work?  


It's easy to figure out how it works with trading stocks or currencies: the stocks are issued by the company and granted to the owners, then they sell the stocks. Currencies are much the same: you have accumulated some cash and you want to trade it. But in both of those cases the trader either owns something or buys it from somebody else. How do traders of futures contracts obtain them?  

P.S. I'm not sure if this is the correct place to get clarification on this subject, but if there is a better stackexchange sub-domain for it, then I'll go there.

  If an exchange facilitates the trading of futures contracts and nobody intends to take delivery of the product, nor do they own it so they can deliver it, then how are the contracts issued? 


Say I want to buy a future contract that allows me to buy coffee at a given price in December 2013. Technically, this contract allows me to buy 37,500 pounds of coffee at the specified price in December 2013. I have two options. If the contract already exists in the market (this contract does), I can simply purchase the contract in the market. If it doesn't exist, however, the process works like this: 

I approach a futures commission merchant, who sends the buy order to a broker on the trading floor/pit or to the exchange order system. Assuming someone else has put in a sell order for the same commodity, expiration, etc. the orders are matched at the agreed upon price, and the futures contract is created.

Also, the FCM reports the trade to the exchange's clearing house, which guarantees the trade and removes counter-party risk. In other words, if the price of coffee changes dramatically, and one of the parties in the trade cannot meet its buy or sell obligation, there isn't a default. The clearing house settles the trade.


  Is there a fixed number of contracts that are created and traded, or is there an ""unlimited"" number of contracts? 


No, there is no fixed number. The Wikipedia article on futures exchanges sums this up:


  Futures contracts are not issued like other securities, but are ""created"" whenever Open interest increases; that is, when one party first buys (goes long) a contract from another party (who goes short). Contracts are also ""destroyed"" in the opposite manner whenever Open interest decreases because traders resell to reduce their long positions or rebuy to reduce their short positions.





  If none of the traders intend to take delivery nor do they want to deliver, then where do the sellers get the contracts to sell? How does that process work? 


The futures market doesn't consist of only traders. The terminology that you usually hear are speculators and hedgers. Speculators are the traders you're thinking of, while hedgers are farmers, oil producers, or companies that rely on commodities. All of these groups enter the futures market in order to lock in a future price at which to buy or sell the products they need, in order to protect themselves from future price swings.

For example, if I'm an oil producer like ExxonMobil, the price of oil significantly affects my future revenue. The price of Brent crude oil is currently around $108/barrel. If this price increases to $120/barrel in a year, they may earn much more revenue. However, if the price drops to $80/barrel, however, their revenue stream is negatively affected. Therefore, I go to the futures market and sell a futures contract that expires in one year and allows me to sell oil for $108/barrel.

If the price of oil jumps to $120/barrel in one year, I would have been better off without a futures contract. However, if the price drops to $80/barrel, I saved myself a considerable loss. This is how the futures market lowers risk and helps to smooth commodity prices in the long run. 

Who takes the other side of the trade? Consider an airline company that knows it will need oil1 for its planes in a year. The airline company will earn more revenue if the price of oil drops to $80/barrel (the exact opposite of ExxonMobil), but lose revenue if the price jumps to $120/barrel. The airline may decide to enter the futures market and agree to buy oil at $108/barrel in one year, thus completing the trade. The futures contract is created and traded in the market.2 3

Expiration

When the contract expires, the buyer/seller either takes delivery of the commodity or the contract is settled for cash between parties. As maturity nears, the price of the contract usually converges to the spot price. Consider our example oil contract, which was created at $108/barrel. If in one year, the spot price of oil has increased to $120/barrel, the contract's price will converge to $120/barrel. Exxon received $108 for its sale of the contract, and now owes $120 in cash or $120 in oil. The cost of its hedge was $12. The airline company bought the contract for $108, and now receives $120. It profited $12 from its hedge, so Exxon would pay the airline company $12. Exxon could sell oil for $120/barrel, but because of the cost of its hedge, it's only receiving $108/barrel, exactly the price it locked in by selling the contract in the first place.

Consider what happens if the price of oil had decreased to $80/barrel. Exxon received $108 for its sale of the contract, and now owes only $80, for a profit of $28. The airline company, however, paid $108, but only received $80 in return, for a loss of $28, so the airline company would pay Exxon $28. Similar to above, Exxon can only fetch $80/barrel for its oil in the spot market, but because it earned $28/barrel by selling a futures contract, it's really receiving $108/barrel for the barrels in the contract.



1 In reality, planes don't run on oil; they run on jet fuel. Since there isn't a futures contract for jet fuel, the airline could study the past relationship between prices of jet fuel and oil in order to estimate the future price of jet fuel, given a future price of oil. Since the company can lock in the price of oil through a futures contract, they'll lock in a price of oil that, based on their estimated model of jet fuel/oil prices, will give them enough funds to purchase the appropriate amount of jet fuel.

2 It's also important to understand that not all hedgers will operate this way. It's certainly possible for a company to hedge too much, and therefore not benefit at all if the price swings in their favor. This has happened to airline companies in the past; even when oil prices have fallen, they haven't benefited because their hedges were expensive enough to outweigh the potential gain. However, had the price increased dramatically, their hedge would have been highly effective. 

3 Also, in this simple example, two companies may choose to bypass the futures market all together and create an over-the-counter (OTC) contract instead. For example, ExxonMobil could agree to sell oil to a specific company at $108/barrel in one year, without entering the futures market at all. This option may be cheaper than entering the futures market, but futures markets also have the benefit of clearing houses to mitigate counterparty risk. If Exxon agrees to sell oil to a company, which then goes bankrupt, Exxon is protected if the hedging was done through the futures market. In the OTC market, this protection isn't always there. OTC contracts can be useful, however, if (for example), the company wants to make or take delivery of a commodity at a different location than that specified in the standardized contracts available on an exchange.

1162,1162,1823,"create a list (or any variable) dynamically, add data to each list and later compare them in C#","I have a list of some strings and I want to create a list for each of them dynamically inside a loop.

The main idea is to get each string from this list through the loop and create a list with this string as a name. Then add some data to it. 

Example:

   List&lt;string&gt; names = new List&lt;string&gt;(); // this is the main list with strings

   foreach (string nm in name)
   {
     // Here create a new list with this name
     // Add data to the list
   }  

   // Now, compare all of them to find duplicate data

   // Give message if any duplicate data found


Update:
Basically, I am going to add data to the list using some database APIs on runtime and the string names are the keys in that API. So with each name in the main list, I will retrieve some data from the database, create a list with that name and add data to it. Later we will compare them together. So the basic question is still how do I create these lists at runtime.

In the above example, you will have a Dictionary with amount of keys equals to the number of unique names, and you can find duplicates by keys having more than one item in their associated List.

3708,3708,5915,How do I force a tight globe-valve water shutoff to fully close?,"I tried to close off the water valve (a multi-twist globe-valve) leading to my back-yard water supply (the shutoff valve is inside the house) but it will not twist fully shut.  Is it safe to give the screw a shot of WD-40 to loosen up the valve?  Will that help?

Note: the valve is not leaking so I don't want to replace it.  I am just trying to shut off the water supply for the winter.
",Haphazard,https://diy.stackexchange.com/users/2708,"Any valve that refuses to fully shut off won't be improved by tightening the handle further. 

The usual problem with a Globe Valve is that the rubber valve seal has aged and cracked, needing replacement. This means you have to shut the water off upstream of the valve and remove the body cartridge so the rubber seal can be changed out.



Some valves have a globe shape, but get misidentified by that shape because they actually are Gate Valves which have a vertical wedge shaped metal gate that gets pushed down into a tapered slot. These fail because sediment accumulates in the slot on the downwards side and the gate no longer can be pushed fully home so the taper seals. This requires the water to be turned off upstream so you can take the top off the valve, extract the gate and grub the sediment out using a piece of welding rod so it will flush out when you reassemble the valve.

I've gone over to using quarter turn ball valves when I have to go to this much trouble. They are better than Globe Valves because the opening is the same size as the inner diameter of the pipe when the valve is full open, the water doesn't have to turn 90 degrees to flow through a restriction as it does in a Globe valve and while the gate valve has the same lack of restriction as the ball, the ball valve has no slot for rust, sand and sediment to accumulate in while it spends most its life wide open.

4890,4890,7783,Ticketing/Project Management/Collaborative Software for Graphic Design,"I manage our company's in-house graphic design.  We have a lot of requests that are very simple (ie, ad-resizing, simple web banners, logo-adjustments, etc) and a number of requests that are complex and require a lot of back and forth (ie, brochures and magazines ranging from 3 to 200 pages, concept design for new ad campaigns, etc...)

Currently, we employ a very simple issue tracking system (which is technically for software development) for all requests. For the most part it does the job.  Users can write a description of the materials they need, upload attachments, leave comments, but because our company is growing in size and the amount of requests are steadily growing, I was looking for a more robust solution.

After doing a lot of research, I've found a number of new systems I could potentially upgrade to, however, everything I have found explains how their system is best suited for an IT/software development team.

So before upgrading to a newer, more robust project management system that is specifically geared toward software development/IT desktop support, I was wondering if anyone of knew of any ticketing/collaborative systems specifically geared toward graphic design?

2072,2072,3302,How to submit errata when a coauthor disagrees,"Some years ago, I was the primary author on a paper in which some of the work was performed by a grad student. At the time I did not notice an error in his work, and so the derivation provided in the paper is incorrect. I contacted my coauthors, included the (former) grad student. The other authors readily agreed to have their names on the errata paper, but the former grad student disagreed and feels that his work was without error. And so he said that he did not want his name on the errata. Contacting the journal that published the original paper, the editor is not willing to publish an errata paper in which the author list does not include the entire list of authors from the original paper.

So I'm stuck. I'm quite certain about the error, and frustrated with the former student's insistence on being correct. But now there is no way to get the errata into the literature. The journal editor suggested perhaps publishing the changes as a ""comment paper"", but comment papers are only allowed if written by someone other than one of the original authors. So that's no help either. I can publish the errata on ArXiV, but many readers of the original paper will never find it.

Does anyone have suggestions on how to get this correction into the literature?
",nzh,https://academia.stackexchange.com/users/33781,"I'll give a few options that occur to me.


Talk to the editor. Essentially ask him what to do. On the one hand he has a policy he wants to follow, and on the other hand he presumably wants corrections of erroneous papers to appear. After all, the alternative is that someone points the error out in a different venue, and the whole community laughs at his journal. Perhaps he will be willing to bend his rules a bit.


You will need to discuss any possible solution with the editor, anyway, so you may want to start out with the most obvious option.


What's to keep you from writing something titled ""Erratum"" with the whole list of authors X, Y and Z, but with two sections ""1. The Erratum (X, Y)"" and ""2. A dissenting point of view (Z)""? Yes, of course we want a paper to have a unified message, but in this particular case, I'd say that getting the word out in any way is better than burying the discussion under mounds of policy.
Propose that you write the erratum, but allow the dissenting author to comment on the erratum and explain why he thinks the erratum is erroneous. Then send both the erratum and the comment out to review and see what the reviewers say.
Perhaps you can do the discussion under point 2. above on the ArXiv, but publish an ""erratum"" with the full author list that does not discuss the error but only points to this discussion on the ArXiv.


One bonus for options 2-4: actually writing up these papers will force everyone to really think about the derivation in question, and either you or the dissenting author may change his mind about whether there is or is not an error.

Option 1 puts the onus on the editor, who may not be very flexible, judging from your question. (Of course, we don't know what he would say.) Options 2-4 are pretty ""meh"", and involve getting both the editor and the dissenting author on board. So given that these three options involve convincing two people, anyway, it may be worthwhile to look at other solutions involving communications.


How deeply have you discussed the putative error with the dissenting author? It may be easier to convince him that there is an error than to convince both him and the editor to collaborate on a ""solution"" nobody is happy with.
How sure are you that in fact there is an error? I'd assume the dissenting author is not completely out of his mind, so perhaps he does have a point?


Options 4 and 5 really involve taking the time to discuss the issue in depth with the dissenting author. I'd recommend doing this in person, if at all possible, not via email or the phone. And do this one-on-one with the dissenter, not together with all the other authors - if he perceives everyone else ""ganging up"" on him, he may become defensive.

Approach this with an open mind. Maybe there is a simple misunderstanding, and the two of you are really thinking of different things when you think you are talking about the same thing. Often you will learn a lot from this kind of discussion. In the best possible case, you will find two different ways of looking at the issue, and maybe even the germ of a follow-up paper.


If all else fails and the editor is in fact an associate editor, you can always escalate the issue to the chief editor.

2760,2760,4398,Repair wood floor damage,"I just moved into a new house.  I have never had wooden floors until now.  Today, we moved a box and saw a strange waxy looking white gunk on the floor after moving a box.  Unknowingly, I scraped it off with my fingernails.  Now, I am pretty sure I scraped off the top layer of my wood floors finish.

I read about wood floor finishes.  Some say I should try to match the floor's finish, but I don't know what it is.  Others have said polyurathane can just be brushed on.  

The wood and stain appear to be fine, but this waxy stuff on top I destroyed.  Its about a 36sq in area that I destroyed.

You may first try using a little mineral spirits or a mild cleaning agent with a polishing compound, such as Bar Keepers Friend with a soft cloth on a small spot to see if it will remove the white residue. If in fact this floor has been treated with a wax product, the entire floor would have to be stripped of wax, perhaps buff sanded and restained, then protected with a few coats of Urethane. Don't attempt to apply urethane until you have determined what is causing the white waxy residue. Putting any coating such as urethane over a waxed floor will bubble, peel, and create a mess to clean up. another test you could do would be to gently scrape a very small section of the white stain with a putty knife.

5207,5207,8275,How important is centring dual-pivot brakes?,"My road bike has Shimano dual-pivot caliper brakes like these.


Whenever I remove or refit the mudguards, or even sometimes just getting the wheel out, they seem to go slightly off-centre, by which I mean rotated around the mounting.

The effect of this is that, when the brakes are applied one pad contacts the rim before the other. Looking carefully the wheel also moves a little to the left or right as one pad pushes it to the side.

I try to rotate the brakes so that both pads contact the rim at the same time to minimise this movement, but as the act of tightening the mounting screw also rotates the brakes slightly, this is tricky.

So the question is - does it matter much if one pad makes contact slightly before the other? What are the likely effects of it doing so?
",James Bradbury,https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/users/5337,"The danger of this is your rim may begin to rub the brake pad – especially when you put in hard out-of-the-saddle efforts.

In theory, if your caliper has become off-centre then one pad will have come closer to the rim and the other will have come further away. You should simply be able to push and rotate the caliper by hand back into a central position without loosening (or tightening) the retaining nut. Pull the brake lever a couple of times and if the caliper does not return to a central position, your brake requires balancing i.e. one pad is moving more than the other towards the rim and causing them not to touch the rim at the same time. The other effect of this is it may cause the caliper to rest off-centre.

There is a small balancing (tensioning) screw on top of the caliper. Turn this left or right until both pads move the same amount to the rim.

4232,4232,6748,How to 'select' menu items that also link to deeper items?,"Currently I'm working on a navigation that doesn't take up too much screen real-estate. I came up with a pseudo off-canvas navigation with stacked menus.

A user can assign nodes to a product. This is the current state of the wireframe; user chose Add nodes. Now he want's to manually search for a specific node 1 (1. Browse Nodes in wireframe). The user now can select a node to add to product 2 or go 1 level deeper into the navigation 3. and 4.. If you click on a node-link the children off that node will slide-in and stack on top of the current menu. There is also a back option to parent (second wireframe).

I deliberately chose checkboxes, links and button as elements because that's their purpose; I wireframed there functionality not a design-solution. Normally I like selecting text/label also checks a checkbox, but now the label is a link too. A user could a) select that node to add to product, Or b) select node to navigate to children of that node.





I could argue if it makes sense that a node will act is a leaf and a branch. A don't have any real data about how customers assign nodes. I can't wait for this input. Currently functionality of the system is that a node could be a leaf and a branch. So asking real users is no option. Maybe in the future (months from now).

",DavyCrockett,https://photo.stackexchange.com/users/19616,"Short Answer

You should not actually convert your images directly into the printer space, as you then actually lose the ability to properly color manage your results.

For color management to work, each device involved in the process needs to be assigned a color profile. The image should be assigned an appropriate color space itself, and that is usually sRGB, AdobeRGB, or ProPhotoRGB. The color space, when assigned to an image, is the images color profile. The computer screen should be assigned its own separate color profile, usually by using a color profiling tool with a matched software package. Finally, if printing, the printer should also have a color profile, which is selected when printing actually takes place.



Color Spaces

Color spaces define how the colors of an image fit within the available known range of color, officially called L*a*b*, or just Lab for short. The Lab space models the entire range of known color as far as the human eye can perceive it, according to studies done by the IE in the 1930s. Standard color spaces such as sRGB, AdobeRGB, and ProPhotoRGB simply define how each color as it can be described by a computer map to specific color ""coordinates"" in Lab space. It is best to only assign one of these to your images. Which one you assign does not actually matter for the most part, however the smaller the space you assign, the more difficult it will be to preserve maximum original information (i.e. sRGB is a fairly small gamut vs. ProPhotoRGB, and downconverting my require multiple colors to reference the same colors in the end.)

Screen Profiles

In order to properly observe your photographs with accurate color on a computer screen, you should calibrate it. Screen calibration is usually done with some kind of device, a colorimiter or a spectrophotometer, which measures the color output of your screen and produces a custom ICC profile specifically for it, and the environment within which it resides. 

A custom ICC profile will ensure that your screen is reproducing color as accurately as possible, and your photography should not only look more realistic (which may mean less saturated!), but it should display finer levels of contrast between pixels better, so what you see on screen should be crisper and sharper. Having a calibrated screen is not a necessity, however it is highly recommended, as comparing prints to an oversaturated screen can make you wonder why things don't seem to match up.

Print Profiles

To print accurately, you need a print profile. Note that is ""print"" profile, not ""printer"" profile. A print profile actually takes into account the printer, its inks, as well as the paper being printed on. Print is probably the most complex thing to calibrate, as so many potential factors come into play, so it is not generally recommended to create your own print profiles.

Most paper manufacturers offer ICC profiles for all of their papers and a variety of printers. At the very least, the top Epson and Canon printers will have ICC profiles from most paper manufacturers like Hahnemuhle, Illford, Red River, etc. If you do not yet have the necessary print profile, I highly recommend finding them and installing them into your system.



Image Color Management

It should be noted that the print profile calibrates the printer, ink, and paper....NOT the image. The image is calibrated by its color space. For the whole entire color space conversion process to work, Image Color Management, or ICM...a component of most computer systems these days, will handle conversion for you. So long as each component involved is properly calibrated, the image viewed on screen and the image printed should look very similar. There will always be some slight differences due to the nature of print (i.e. printing on a warm paper while your screen is calibrated to a D65 whitepoint will result in a white balance shift between the two.) 

If you assign a profile for a different component to the wrong thing, such as a print profile to an image, not only will the image look wrong on screen, but it will likely look doubly wrong in print. Keep each component assigned its proper profile from the proper pool of valid profiles, and everything should remain consistent.

4347,4347,6922,Wireless link frequency choice (900Mhz vs 5.8Ghz) for 2-3km distance,"I have recently been contracted by a client of mine to facilitate the wireless communication of his ""home"" offices and a secondary site. 

The primary site is the top two floors of a 5-story office building (15m height more or less) an the secondary is one of two open ""lots"" (which one is TBD by management). The ground distance from the secondary sites is a little more than 2km for the one closer and around 2.9km for the one furthest. 

The link will be used to transmit the video feed of 1 (or even possibly two) IP cameras and some kind of Ethernet-enabled environmental or weather sensor. I have checked the necessary b/w for the cameras and both 900Mhz and 5.8Ghz are more than adequate for even 4 of them, much more for 2. I have also verified that there is clear line-of-sight to both possible installation points and that the 60% Fresnel Zone clearance is more than covered. Bear in mind that this is my first long distance link (long with or without quotes) and I hate to admit that wireless physics is far from my strong suit.

The ultimate point of my question is that although I have read a lot about frequency choice the last few days, I continue to find some ambiguity (I know it is just me that finds it ambiguous). Most sources, like this one, agree that although the lower frequencies have less losses over a given distance (free-space-loss I learned it is called) they need larger antennae for the same ""strength"" of trasmission (is ""gain"" really the same as ""strength""?). 

So, for the given distance of 2-3km and given also that all typical requirements are met, which is preferable (or do I dare say ""better"") frequency? Should I choose 900Mhz with a relatively ""small"" antenna on the basis that 3km is not really ""long distance"" and that it will provide a link with less attenuation ergo less retransmits ergo higher overall speed? Or should I choose the 5.8Ghz option for the superior b/w (I am still not very sure about this, please correct me if wrong) on the basis that at this distance there is no real difference so why not take the ""better"" one?

On a side note, should I stay to the beaten path of true WiFi or should I consider proprietary bridging solutions like the ones from Ubiquiti? I have a lot of experience with their Access Points and am really satisfied, so I would not mind integrating one more of their products in my client. In any case, I am looking for an optimal solution, choice of vendor is of very little concern at this point.

Forgive my ignorance and the possible mistaken use of language. 

UPDATE:
I arranged to have a spectrum analyzer on loan for a couple of days. I will make sure that the 900Mhz band is reasonably clear and proceed down that way.

UPDATE 2:
I had the aforementioned equipment available to play with for a day and a half. The conclusive finding is that the 9Mhz band is almost ""empty"" in the area, as one suggested here, so that takes care for the frequency choice issue. 

Concerning the equipment now, I am going with Ubiquiti AirMax Yagi antennae and matching RM900 2x2 radios. Preliminary testing on my part and from the client's employees shows that performance exceeds expectations. 

On a side note, the chosen ""lot"" is the one that is 3km away. 
",dsljanus,https://serverfault.com/users/181235,"Chris S's answer is incorrect in several areas.

3km is not approaching the limit of 5.8GHz.  Similarly, that's not as big of a distance as for 2.4GHz wifi either.  Chris says 10X, I say 100X the distance is possible.  The longest range 5.8GHz wifi that I've heard of is 304KM with a 1.2M hand made antenna (See: Long Range Wifi).  I believe it went over water so there were not any thing in the way of the signal.  It used Ubiquity radios.  I don't know if it was reliable, but to get a connection and send data over that distance is nothing short of amazing.  

I used to work for a wisp carrier and had wifi radios about twice the size of your hand easily going 10KM with good line of site.  I personally had wifi on my house going 8KM without any issues.  Amazingly, they were only 500mW.  

We were using 5GHz radios and a mixture of Ubiquity and Microtik hardware.  They work almost flawlessly.

While it is true that with lower frequencies you need bigger antennas.  You'll notice that your home wifi doesn't have large antennas.  Neither do 5GHz ones.

In reality, 2.4GHz should perform better, but 5GHz in my experience works just as well.
In theory, 5GHz could be affected by rain fade, but I didn't find that even over the 8KM link.

As for 2.4GHz and other devices like microwaves and cordless phones inside the office, it doesn't even factor in.  The reason it doesn't factor in is that you'll be using directional antennas.  Better still, if the antenna is on an iron roof you will be shielded from all that noise coming from inside the office/house. 

Having said all of that, I will say that it's not perfect for every situation.
You need:


Line of site between the two buildings. Factoring in the freznel zone (good open clearance)  
A suitable place to mount the antenna to achieve point 1.
Hopefully not much wifi traffic facing your directional antennas (no gaurantees there, but it should be workable) even in a reasonably crowded wifi space.


Freznel zone looks like this:

By the way, I've had trees in the way of the freznel zone and in some cases right in the middle and it still worked, although it does affect the performance a lot.  Install your antennas as high as practical/possible.

You can still get interference issues.  Usually because of other devices transmitting in your direction at the same frequency.  So it's not perfect.  Directional antennas help a lot with that.

I can recommend the 5.8GHz radios simply because I know they work well. And yes, provide good bandwidth! From memory I used a Ubiquity Bullet M5 with a patch antenna (another brand).  The other end was a less directional antenna feeding multiple clients but used a similar Microtik radio.

I don't know of anyone who uses 900MHz.  But I do see you can buy them at around 3X the cost than 2.4 or 5.8.  Stick away from it, it seems uncommon.  In several countries the 900MHz spectrum is quite crowded anyway.



Update: You've been looking at the airmax antennas and the 900MHz radios.  While I think performance should be great.  I think you may be spending much more than you need to... perhaps a little overkill!?  3KM is not a long distance.  I'd try some of these if you can.

http://www.gowifi.co.nz/antennas/5-ghz/directional/5.8-ghz-27-dbi-cast-reflector-grid-antenna.html combined with a Bullet M5.



Update2: You can also mitigate interference issues using polarized antennas.  Here's a good write up that explains the concept.  From memory, we used horizontal polarization.  As I recall sometimes if I set the client radio to vertical polarization I could see maybe 12 AP's.  But when setting it to horizontal I only saw 3 or 4 and half of them were ours.

I arranged to have a spectrum analyzer on loan for a couple of days. I will make sure that the 900Mhz band is reasonably clear and proceed down that way.

UPDATE 2:
I had the aforementioned equipment available to play with for a day and a half. The conclusive finding is that the 9Mhz band is almost ""empty"" in the area, as one suggested here, so that takes care for the frequency choice issue. 

Concerning the equipment now, I am going with Ubiquiti AirMax Yagi antennae and matching RM900 2x2 radios. Preliminary testing on my part and from the client's employees shows that performance exceeds expectations. 

On a side note, the chosen ""lot"" is the one that is 3km away. 
","Chris S's answer is incorrect in several areas.

3km is not approaching the limit of 5.8GHz.  Similarly, that's not as big of a distance as for 2.4GHz wifi either.  Chris says 10X, I say 100X the distance is possible.  The longest range 5.8GHz wifi that I've heard of is 304KM with a 1.2M hand made antenna (See: Long Range Wifi).  I believe it went over water so there were not any thing in the way of the signal.  It used Ubiquity radios.  I don't know if it was reliable, but to get a connection and send data over that distance is nothing short of amazing.  

I used to work for a wisp carrier and had wifi radios about twice the size of your hand easily going 10KM with good line of site.  I personally had wifi on my house going 8KM without any issues.  Amazingly, they were only 500mW.  

We were using 5GHz radios and a mixture of Ubiquity and Microtik hardware.  They work almost flawlessly.

While it is true that with lower frequencies you need bigger antennas.  You'll notice that your home wifi doesn't have large antennas.  Neither do 5GHz ones.

In reality, 2.4GHz should perform better, but 5GHz in my experience works just as well.
In theory, 5GHz could be affected by rain fade, but I didn't find that even over the 8KM link.

As for 2.4GHz and other devices like microwaves and cordless phones inside the office, it doesn't even factor in.  The reason it doesn't factor in is that you'll be using directional antennas.  Better still, if the antenna is on an iron roof you will be shielded from all that noise coming from inside the office/house. 

Having said all of that, I will say that it's not perfect for every situation.
You need:


Line of site between the two buildings. Factoring in the freznel zone (good open clearance)  
A suitable place to mount the antenna to achieve point 1.
Hopefully not much wifi traffic facing your directional antennas (no gaurantees there, but it should be workable) even in a reasonably crowded wifi space.


Freznel zone looks like this:

By the way, I've had trees in the way of the freznel zone and in some cases right in the middle and it still worked, although it does affect the performance a lot.  Install your antennas as high as practical/possible.

You can still get interference issues.  Usually because of other devices transmitting in your direction at the same frequency.  So it's not perfect.  Directional antennas help a lot with that.

I can recommend the 5.8GHz radios simply because I know they work well. And yes, provide good bandwidth! From memory I used a Ubiquity Bullet M5 with a patch antenna (another brand).  The other end was a less directional antenna feeding multiple clients but used a similar Microtik radio.

I don't know of anyone who uses 900MHz.  But I do see you can buy them at around 3X the cost than 2.4 or 5.8.  Stick away from it, it seems uncommon.  In several countries the 900MHz spectrum is quite crowded anyway.



Update: You've been looking at the airmax antennas and the 900MHz radios.  While I think performance should be great.  I think you may be spending much more than you need to... perhaps a little overkill!?  3KM is not a long distance.  I'd try some of these if you can.

http://www.gowifi.co.nz/antennas/5-ghz/directional/5.8-ghz-27-dbi-cast-reflector-grid-antenna.html combined with a Bullet M5.



Update2: You can also mitigate interference issues using polarized antennas.  Here's a good write up that explains the concept.  From memory, we used horizontal polarization.  As I recall sometimes if I set the client radio to vertical polarization I could see maybe 12 AP's.  But when setting it to horizontal I only saw 3 or 4 and half of them were ours.

We ran the DBCC TRACEON (1204) command and have watched the log's but it's not reporting any deadlocks.

Any idea what could trigger this to just go off? We are getting the alert every minute yet can't find any actual deadlocks.

Edit: I should add that before this reboot we had never received this error

Edit 2: We used SQL Server Profiler as well to look for deadlocks, let it run for 5 minutes over which we received 5 error alerts and when we checked the details we had NO deadlocks found.

Edit 3: March 06/2014: Ran the query and it worked, but it reports what our other details have said that we have no locks we where still getting the error above the whole time.

Thanks again for all your help!



Edit 4: March 06/2014: I ran the query and here is a sampling of the result set, I will admit I am not exactly sure what I am looking at here, that is to say I am not sure if it shows me something that I can act on or not.

In markdown, should any indicator of line numbers survive copy-paste in markdown?

Does any scheme like this need to do work to handle quoting of responses in markdown?  Is it common for inline responders to split code sections?

Do users also want to number lines ( http://google-code-prettify.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/README.html#linenums ), so that others can respond with reference to particular lines?

The downside to this is that whenever I change the smart object, I need to repeat this process.

",JCBK,https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/users/4089,"Yes, there's quite a few ways to achieve this.

If you want to paste objects from Illustrator as Smart Objects, then you can use is a a clipping mask for layers above. To clip a layer above the Smart Object, option-click between the layers. You should end up with something like this.



That's not how I'd do it though. The simpler option is just to have a vector mask on your bitmap layer (or vector layer, gradient, pattern or text). To do this, paste your path(s) from Illustrator as a Shape Object (very important!). You'll end up with something like this.



That's a shape layer in Photoshop CS6 (CS5 and earlier versions are similar).

If you'd like to use that path as a mask on another layer, select it using the Path Selection tool (A), then press command-C to copy it.

Then go to the bitmap layer you'd like to apply the vector mask to, and press command-V to paste.



Then choose Layer > Vector Mask > Current Path to use the path as the mask (this was slightly easier in CS5, as it could be all done by option-dragging the vector mask from one layer to another).

You'll end up with a bitmap layer with a vector mask.



Why is this better? It's one layer, not two. Your vector mask is still editable. You can also now clip other layers to this layer.

There's a lot of reasons why I don't like using Smart Objects. In most cases, Shape layers are better, unless you need the Smart Object to contain more than one colour or gradient itself, which is pretty rare for me.

There's a few other ways to mask, including using group masks. It really depends on what's important though.

3888,3888,6194,Powering a Futaba S3003 servo,"I'm working on a project and I need to use a Futaba S3003 servo, I'm about to buy a transformer that gives 6v, the thing I'm not sure about is the amperage.

Is this transformer ok? I can choose 3V, 4.5V, 6V, 7.5V, 9V and 12V, but its 800mA and I don't know if it is OK with the servo.

EDIT:
Link to servo datasheet: http://www.es.co.th/schemetic/pdf/et-servo-s3003.pdf

The transformer is only for powering the servo


",elunicotomas,https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/54454,"I'm going to do a bit of math on this and make some outlandish assumptions because the data sheet does not give enough information. Stall torque is reckoned to be about ~3.5 kg.cm and full speed is reckoned to be about ~0.2 seconds per 60 degrees of rotation.

Many thanks to Brian Drummond for correcting my stupid math mistake so here's the corrected answer with a bit more theory. First, it is a fair assumption that the servo will contain a small dc motor and, generally, this is the torque-speed characteristic for such a motor: -



Note the blue line - at zero speed, torque is maximum (stall torque) and with no load (zero mechanical torque other than losses in the bearings), speed is maximum. This is just a graph of any old motor I stole from the internet BUT it is largely representative of all DC motors.

Now look at the red curve - this is mechanical power out and equates to: -

Mechanical power = \$2\pi n T\$ where n is revs per second and T is torque in newton metres (N.m)

So, the 3.5 kg.cm translates to approximately 35 N.cm or about 0.35 N.m 

A ""speed"" of 0.2 seconds per 60 degrees is upside down but, rearranging, it basically means 0.166 revs per fifth of a second and this translates to 0.833 revs per second.

Go back to the graph and note that max power is roughly when both torque and speed are at their respective half values therefore,

Power is \$2 \times\pi \times (0.833/2) \times (0.35/2)\$ = 0.458 watts

This is the peak mechanical output power I have estimated from the limited information in the data sheet. Of course it might be a bit higher or lower. 

Next, a motor this small may not be very efficient at converting electrical power to mechancial power so we need to apply a ""frig"" factor. Let's say it's 50% efficient. This now means the input electical power might be about 0.9 watts.

There is a lot of hand waving here and to play a little more safely you might assume that the power supply needs to supply maybe double this value. I suspect there will be a little H bridge controller inside the servo and this might only be 50% efficient so maybe 2 watts should cover most eventualities.

Please insert your own numbers and frig factors into the equations if you think I may have over-egged the omelette.

5545,5545,8806,Initial state in F# List.scan,"I have a simple problem and as I'm an F# newbie I can't seem to figure out how to do this. I have a list of tuples:

that I want to transform into this:

let r = [ (a, 2); (b, 5); (c, 7); (d, 13) ]


This simply adds the values of the second element in each tuple: 2 + 3 + 2 + 6. The objects a, b, c and d are complex objects that I simply want to keep.

I thought I should use List.scan for this. It takes a list, threads an accumulator through the computation and returns a list:

let r = l |&gt; List.scan (fun (_, s) (o, i) -&gt; (o, s + i)) (??, 0) |&gt; List.tail


But I don't know what to fill in for the question marks. I'm not interested in the initial state except for the 0. And I don't want to specify some 'empty' instance of the first tuple element.

Separately, they both works alone, but together, firstly ajax function works, second validation works. it is not right.. How can I combine those in one? Firstly to validate form, then get ajax response.

Here is form:

            &lt;div class=""form_info cmsms_input""&gt;
                &lt;label&gt;Email&lt;span class=""color_3""&gt; *&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/label&gt;
                @Html.TextBoxFor(model =&gt; model.Email, new { name = ""email"", id = ""email"", tabidex = 1, @class = ""validate[required,custom[email]]"" })
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class=""form_info cmsms_textarea""&gt;
                &lt;label&gt;Message&lt;span class=""color_3""&gt; *&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/label&gt;
                @Html.TextAreaFor(model =&gt; model.Message, new { id = ""messageText"", name = ""messageText"", tabindex = 2, @class = ""validate[required,minSize[10]]"" })
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class=""loading""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div&gt;

4729,4729,7503,Flash Memory Failure Modes - Block Failure,"My understanding is that typical flash memory failures, such as those due to erase cycles, occur at the bit level.  I have a flash in which entire blocks (actually two blocks) are failing.  Is there a common explanation for this?  

More specifically, I have two blocks in a NAND flash device which are failing. These blocks are separated by one working block.  The two failing blocks can be erased (I can confirm by reading by all ones), but after programming with 'random' data all of the bits are shown as all zeros.

Both blocks appear to have failed 'simultaneously'

I know that the flash part is nowhere near its max erase-cycle spec of 100k cycles.

3048,3048,4856,Why do objects fall at the same acceleration?,"I read these two posts and now I am more confused.

Do heavier objects fall faster?

Don&#39;t heavier objects actually fall faster because they exert their own gravity?

I was going to ask: if mass is an objects tendency to resist acceleration then why do two objects of different masses fall to the Earth at the same acceleration?

Then I read those posts and it seems that even though it is very small, the more massive object falls faster. Okay I understand, both objects attract each other.

If two cars of different masses collide doesn't the car with less mass accelerate more even though both cars received the same Force. Then that implies you need more force to accelerate a large mass than to accelerate a small mass. Because that is how I see it, the Moon attracts the Earth with the same Force as the Earth attracts the Moon but the Earth accelerates less due to its larger mass.

So then how is mass an object's tendency to resist acceleration? I am aware of $F_1 = F_2 = GMm/r^2$. So should we not really be able to see the difference in acceleration when dropping a massive object?

This, however, is true in the frame of reference of the center of mass of the combined bodies. It is also true that the earth is attracted to the falling body, and with twice the mass (of the falling body), the earth's acceleration is twice as large.

1040,1040,1636,How much of the English language comes from each of its influences?,"I was watching a video linked in this answer and it made the following claim:


  [...] like most words in English is derived from German.


That got me thinking. While I know that Germanic languages have greatly influenced English, so have the Latin and Celtic ones (and various others to a greater or lesser degree). Is it true that more than 50% of the English vocabulary is derived from Germanic roots?

More generally, can someone point me to data on this? I imagine attempts have been made to quantify the contribution of different languages to English; what were the results? What percentage of the language comes from each source?

Ideally I would like to see this expressed in terms of % of words but I am aware that, at least to some linguists, attempting to quantify vocabulary is anathema (to give a simple reason, all languages that allow number construction have an infinite  vocabulary by definition), so alternative approaches to quantifying this are also welcome.

To answer your question, it does not appear to be true that 50% of words are Germanic. However, that probably depends on what your context is.

First, forget that it's alternating current, just to simplify things.
Think of the power source as a really big 220 volt battery.

If it's drawing 1500 watts, divide that by 220, and that will tell you the current I in Amperes.
(That just measures how many electrons per second are flowing. An Ampere is about 6x10^23 electrons per second.)

To get the resistance R in Ohms, just divide the voltage V (220 volts) by the current I that you got above.
(An Ohm is just the number of volts it takes to push one Ampere through the resistor.)

I hope you can see that the smaller the resistance is, the bigger the current is, and when you multiply that by the voltage, you get the power.

So the way you make a bigger heater or light bulb is by giving it less electrical resistance.

",emersonthis,https://wordpress.stackexchange.com/users/11363,"In general, the best place to look is in your theme folders, specifically the main theme and in the index.php file. Then the footer and header files.

Also, check your modified dates and start with the most recently modified. Especially if there are several that were all modified around the same date/time.

I've seen, and had to fix, this problem several times on people's servers. The false data is normally loaded via a script inserted into the php files of the template.

First, you should definitely read over the Wordpress FAQ for dealing with a hacked site.

Common entry points for gaining the ""access"" required to pull the injection off are outdated themes and/or plugins. It's best to run production servers with only the one active theme on the server, as well as removing unused plugins and replacing outdated active plugins.

There are a few scripts out there that you can upload to your server to help you find infected files so you can replace, clean or delete them. (Links listed below)

Again, try looking at file modified dates and check out ones you haven't modified/installed recently yet have a recent date on the.


Look for Bad Guys : I've used this one. It takes a bunch of configuration to root out all the false positives ... but it can at least help you get a general idea of which files to check out.
Wordfence offers the ability to scan your files with their free plugin, I can't personally endorse it though, since I haven't used it myself.

Sucuri is linked on the Wordpress forums frequently and they have a plugin for scanning as well, but once again... haven't personally used it. But I'm a hands-on kind of person.

4908,4908,7810,Seperation of drawing and logic in games,"I'm a developer that's just now starting to mess around with game development. I'm a .Net guy, so I've messed with XNA and am now playing around with Cocos2d for the iPhone. My question really is more general though. 

Let's say I'm building a simple Pong game. I'd have a Ball class and a Paddle class. Coming from the business world development, my first instinct is to not have any drawing or input handling code in either of these classes.

//pseudo code
class Ball
{
   Vector2D position;
   Vector2D velocity;
   Color color;
   void Move(){}
}


Nothing in the ball class handles input, or deals with drawing. I'd then have another class, my Game class, or my Scene.m (in Cocos2D) which would new up the Ball, and during the game loop, it would manipulate the ball as needed.

The thing is though, in many tutorials for both XNA and Cocos2D, I see a pattern like this:

//pseudo code
class Ball : SomeUpdatableComponent
{
   Vector2D position;
   Vector2D velocity;
   Color color;
   void Update(){}
   void Draw(){}
   void HandleInput(){}
}


My question is, is this right? Is this the pattern that people use in game development? It somehow goes against everything I'm used to, to have my Ball class do everything. Furthermore, in this second example, where my Ball knows how to move around, how would I handle collision detection with the Paddle? Would the Ball need to have knowledge of the Paddle? In my first example, the Game class would have references to both the Ball and the Paddle, and then ship both of those off to some CollisionDetection manager or something, but how do I deal with the complexity of various components, if each individual component does everything themselves? (I hope I'm making sense.....)

",Baskaran,https://photo.stackexchange.com/users/26934,"I don't know what specific model rotary wheel Nikon used in that camera, but moving it fast shouldn't cause any excessive wear.

These rotary wheels are usually just rather simple mechanical switches.  There are usually two separate switches.  Each goes thru one complete cycle each detent, but the two are off from each other by 1/4 cycle.  The fancy name for that is quadrature.  With two quadrature signals, there are 4 states that get sequenced thru for each whole increment.  It is quite easy to decode these two signals to keep track of the position of the wheel, regardless of what direction it is being moved in.

One part of the switch usually rubs against a part of the wheel so that it is moved into and out of contact with the other part of the switch.  The wear on the device is therefore mostly related to total revolutions, not how fast those revolutions are, at least not for something you can do by hand.

If you spin it too fast, about the worst that is likely to happen is that the firmware gets confused and looses track of where the wheel is.  It may miss increments, or even think you are spinning it the other direction.

Most likely the rotaty wheel will outlast your ability to spin it, whether you spin it fast or slow.

396,396,620,What would be the best way to design a real time clock for the MSP430?,"Basically that. The way I am doing it now is with the TimerA set to 1 second interrupts. But I think that it's very annoying. Are there any other ways to do it?

I want to basically set timers on that clock, like, shutdown until 40 seconds have passed... 
",Sergio Campamá,https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/3771,"It's not perfectly clear to whether you want a real-time clock or a stopwatch (the 40 seconds you mention).  

You could use an RTC IC (Real-Time Clock), like the NXP PCF8563. This one is available in several packages, including both the old DIL and a very small DFN.
But you probably don't need a separate RTC IC. It's typically used because it consumes very little power, and the rest of the circuit can power down while the RTC keeps running of a battery or supercap. The MSP430, however, is also a low-power device, and it has a low-frequency oscillator which can run on the same 32.768kHz crystal you would use for the RTC.
In one project I had the MSP430 running continuously on a 32kHz crystal, and yet it consumed less than 5\$\mu\$A. That's more than an RTC (the PCF8563 only needs 250nA), but it will be acceptable for many applications.  

What's your problem with the 1s interrupt? If you want to make a real-time clock you'll need a time-cue anyhow, whether generated internally or coming from an external RTC. Upon interrupt you can perform required updates of seconds, minutes and hour counters, and wait for the next interrupt. You even could work with 10ths of a second, although with the 32.768kHz this will have a minor deviation. You would have four tenths of a second or 3277 clock ticks, followed by one tenth of 3278 ticks, to get exactly 1/2 second, so repeat this pattern a second time to complete one second.

First key gen:
$p\gets 7,q\gets 13,n\gets pq=91, e\gets 5, d\gets 29$

Thus your public key is $(e,n)$ and your private key is $d$.

Say we want to sign the message $m=35$, we compute $s=m^d\bmod{n}$ which is $s\gets 42\equiv 35^{29}\bmod{n}$.

The message and signature get sent to the other party $(m,s)=(35,42)$. Who takes the signature and raises it to the $e$ modulo $n$, or $42^{5}\equiv 35 \bmod{n}$. Then makes sure that this value is equal to the message that was received, which it is, so the message is valid.
