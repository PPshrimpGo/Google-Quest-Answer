706,706,1116,Nikon D3000 Blurry Pictures. Focus Issue?,"Here are two examples:




Both pictures are in NEF format here.

The pictures have not been modified in any way except except for being resized and converted to PNG.

Just for kicks (and to prove I'm not crazy) I sharpened the butterfly image via ""unsharp mask."" It's not a pretty result but I just wanted to demonstrate ""sharp"" vs. ""blurred.""



Kind of annoying because I've ruined many epic shots with this odd focus problem.

My original Film SLR was a Minolta Dynax 505si Super 35mm (or in the same family, I think) and it performed marvellously. I used it for about 4 or 5 years all throughout high school and then (as an avid film photographer) begrudgingly made the switch over to digital in college. But the Minolta definitely gave me experience in photography and people genuinely enjoyed my photographs.

Early on, I don't know if I was just enamoured with the idea of vibrant digital images from an SLR or if I just didn't notice enough, but I don't remember a whole lot of images that came out blurry in the beginning. Maybe 60% of them (a liberal estimate). I accidentally deleted about a year's worth of early pictures so I'm unable to tell now.

The preview in the viewfinder doesn't appear to be blurry at all; then again, there's a huge different between the 3"" preview screen and my 20"" computer monitor.

Here are things I've tried:


Using a tripod (although, as you can tell, the issue is not a motion blur issue).
Tried different aperture settings (for example, the landscape image is f/22).
Tried different ISO.
Manual focus.
Auto focus.
Manually ""de-focusing"" the object (focusing behind it and focusing in front of it). Although, with the picture of the butterfly, this doesn't seem to be the case: it has varying depth of field and even the supposedly ""in-focus"" butterfly is out of focus.
Changing the ""sharpening"" property via the camera: Menu > Set Picture Control > (picture control -- e.g. ""Neutral"") > Sharpening
Went into a physical repair shop and they did test images. They didn't seem to find a problem, patted me on the head, and told me to be a good photographer and use the autofocus.
Letting someone else take the picture.
Chromatic aberration correction (typically through Digikam)
Different Lenses. The two below are using my AF-S Nikkor 18-55mm 1.3.5-5.6 G lens. I have a AF-S Nikkor 55-200mm 1.4-5.6G ED telephoto and get the same result (sometimes result is worse -- can post an example if needed).
And, oh, yeah, I even sent it into Nikon...three times. They said they fixed the problem. But, you know how those things go...


Oddly enough I've looked up reviews for my camera and both lenses and couldn't find many (if any) reviews stating blurry pictures for every picture.

A few thoughts:


Could whichever photo editing program I'm using be the cause of the blur? I used Linux so I've used Digikam (my favorite), F-Spot, and the Gimp.
Maybe it's normal for digital pictures to be blurry compared to film? Digital doesn't use crystals like film, so the opposite should seem true. I wonder this because a lot of work has gone into sharpening tools like unsharpen mask.


Sorry for the long post and various photo examples. Thanks in advance!
",i41,https://photo.stackexchange.com/users/29811,"I see no problem in either of these images.  They both appear correct.  Lenses are not 100% sharp to begin with and on cheaper lenses it is not atypical for the resolution of the camera to outpace the resolution of the lens, particularly on entry level and kit lenses like the two you are using.

This is even further compounded by using high aperture on a crop body camera.  The smaller point you try to focus light on, the more of an issue diffraction becomes when shining the light through a small hole.  The smaller the hole, the more impact diffraction has and this reduces what level of quality is possible to capture.  Try shooting at or above f/8 or so and diffraction limiting shouldn't be a problem.  You might be able to go a bit higher than that based on your resolution, but I didn't do the calculations to figure out exactly when it is a problem.  (There are calculators online if you want to check exactly when it should theoretically start being an issue.)

The first one certainly has a shallow depth of field, but it appears as sharp as expected for your choice of aperture and lens.  Your unsharp masked version seems over-sharpened.  It over-exaggerates the edges and makes things ""jump out"" more, but is unnaturally so.

I currently manually build these every time I need one, either starting from a fresh OS install or using sysprep when working with SharePoint 2010 and SQL Server 2008 R2. I currently use VMWare, but am open to VirtualBox or Hyper-V.

I'd like to be able to go from zero to a working VM with SharePoint, SQL and Visual Studio all through script. Is this a feasible task? Or are there more practical methods which would start from a VM with a fresh installation of an OS, and then use more standard unattended installs.

Although general, I'd like to know which direction to focus my efforts.

Thanks in advance,

","If you are using vmware server you can look into the snapshot feature to create a primary VM then take the snapshot as you have tweaked to your liking. Then you can utilize the snapshot manager to ""revert"" back to a clean vm when your project is complete.

Virtualbox too has this ability and it is included free, so if cost is an issue perhaps that is a better choice.

  Dungeon Starters are a form of GM prep for running the first session of a Dungeon World game. Dungeon Starters don’t dictate plot, they’re not Fronts (you write those after the first session), and they don’t replace the GM playbook. They are for those times when you want to just sit down and start a game right then. Dungeon Starters provide a unified flavor to your prep but, when you get down to it, they are really just an unordered cloud of blanks and hooks with some appropriate moving parts to make sure the players don’t catch you with nothing interesting to say. Dungeon Starters are made up of questions, impressions, custom moves, items and services, spells, and monsters (among other things).

4060,4060,6478,DNS/MX issues arising when migrating Heroku app to Dream Host hosted domain,"I have a domain - myapp.com - hosted by Dream Host. Up until recently I had some php as a signup form at that domain. I also had a one-click install of Word Press at blog.myapp.com, and could log into GMail through Google Apps from Dream Host at mail.myapp.com. 

A few days ago I migrated my Rails app over to myapp.com using Heroku's Zerigo add-on. Zerigo worked magic migrating my app over to myapp.com, however blog.myapp.com didn't work, and neither did mail.myapp.com. (I could access mail but I had to go mail.google.com/a/myapp.com. Plus I was having people tell me their emails to me were bouncing back with errors.)

I contacted Dream Host who helped with getting my blog back - they had me use custom DNS by setting the A record with value 173.236.196.13 for blog.myapp.com
and www.blog.myapp.com. I did this in Zerigo. The blog was back.

However, I still couldn't access my mail through mail.myapp.com. So I went back to Dream Host and they told me to:


Have MX records set for myapp.com and mail.myapp.com pointing to mx1.sub4.homie.mail.dreamhost.com. and mx2.sub4.homie.mail.dreamhost.com. Priority of 0 (zero) for both.
Set an A record for mail.myapp.com pointing to 208.97.132.231 and another for webmail.myapp.com pointing to 208.97.187.139. 


I did all of the above in Zerigo as well and nothing worked. Worse yet, I think my email stopped working. So I removed the MX records for dreamhost, as well as the A records pointing to 208.97.187.139.

So where things currently stand, I have an app that works, a blog that works, but email that I still can't access at mail.myapp.com. And that freaks me out. How can I fix this?

I should note that I'm trying to send mail from my app in SendGrid and GMail (only locally), but have my email accounts and everything else with Google Apps.

As such, and combining with NMindz answer, try this:

@media all and (min-width: 1000px) {
  nav ul { 
    display: block !important;
    top: 60px;
  }
}


You could also try a pure css solution that would probably be better. Something like

nav ul.show {
    display: block;
}


And for the javascript

$(function() {
    $('.nav-btn').click(function(event) {
        $('nav ul').toggleClass(""show"");
    });
});

However, I may want to go on a road trip and the end of my stay on the west coast.
Will it make insurance cheaper to get a driving licence here if I want to rent or buy a car for 4 weeks? I am in possession of a Dutch driving licence.

Also, do they make a distinction between in-state and out-of-state licences when renting a car?
",Patrick,https://travel.stackexchange.com/users/7756,"The exact requirements vary from state to state, but in New York it appears that there is no requirement for you to get a NY Drivers License (as opposed to some other states where once you have been a resident for more than 3 months your home country drivers license is no longer valid).

However on a J1 visa you can optionally get a local drivers license, as long as your visa length is greater than 1 year, AND you have at least 6 months of validity on the visa remaining.

As far as whether it's worth doing this for the purpose of insurance, it depends on what type of insurance you are after.

For rental car insurance, there is no difference in cost of the insurance depending on the type of license you have. If you are getting the insurance from the rental car company (CDP/LDW/etc) then they will not vary it depending on the type of license you have.  If you are getting it via travel insurance or credit card insurance then again it will not vary based on your license - but be sure to read the fine print to make sure it's covered!

If you are looking at buying a car, then it will make a difference, but be prepared for a shock either way. Many insurance companies will not offer you insurance if you do not have a US drivers license.  I've been told there are some that will - especially for medium-term tourists - but expect to pay a lot for it.

If you do have a US drivers license then you will be able to get coverage, but it will not be cheap. Every insurance company I've ever looked at will ask you how long you've been licensed in the US, and will penalize you heavily for anything below 18 months/3 years/5 years (depending on the company). Most will also ask how long you've held a license in another country, and may reduce the price slightly due to your overseas license - but it won't be by much.

Plugging your details, along with those of the type of car you might consider buying, into some of the insurance companies websites will probably be very telling for you - both in terms of whether they will allow you to purchase coverage without a US license, and how much they will charge with only 1-2 months license history in the US.

One thing I noticed from your post is that, the base64 encoded result generated from the library is way too long and looks wrong. Is it possible that you are not base64-encoding the binary signature?

Could you try this code for getting the base64 encoded string of the signature?

  var rsa = new RSAKey();
  rsa.readPrivateKeyFromPEMString(document.form1.prvkey1.value); //replace with your private key
  var hSig = rsa.signString(""x"", ""sha1"");

If you compare the value of ""base64_encoded_signature"" with what you get from the openssl command, they should be the same.

Is it possible that this is because of the SHA1 implementation being used? In that case, I could try to use another one.

I'm no expert of cryptography, but the OAuth RFC 5849 is saying that RSASSA-PKCS1-V1_5-SIGN needs to be used, which seems to be the case for the library.

Thank you very much.
","I tried both the openssl command and the JS library you mentioned above, and the results are consistent. The signatures that I get from both ways are the same.

One thing I noticed from your post is that, the base64 encoded result generated from the library is way too long and looks wrong. Is it possible that you are not base64-encoding the binary signature?

Could you try this code for getting the base64 encoded string of the signature?

function doSign() {
  var rsa = new RSAKey();
  rsa.readPrivateKeyFromPEMString(document.form1.prvkey1.value); //replace with your private key
  var hSig = rsa.signString(""x"", ""sha1"");
  var base64_encoded_signature = hex2b64(hSig);
}


If you compare the value of ""base64_encoded_signature"" with what you get from the openssl command, they should be the same.

  things are naked and open to the eyes of Him to whom we must give
  account.


Psalm 139:4


  Even before a word is on my tongue, behold, O Lord, you know it

So if God knows all, then the question becomes why did God ask the question, because it wasn't because he didn't know. So if the question wasn't for God's benefit, then it must have been for Adam's

If we process the whole scene, Adam and Eve had been in perfect relationship and fellowship with God until they disobeyed and sinned against God. Then all of the sudden Adam and Eve are trying to avoid God. When God asks the question, even in Adam's hearing of the question, he has to realize that something isn't right. 

God has never had to ask this question before, because Adam had never hidden from God before. So for God to ask, let's Adam know even before he answers, that God knows something is wrong.

Even in the same scripture God continues to ask questions. God could've just came in and said ""Adam and Eve you sinned and the serpent tempted you, here are your curses, see you later"", but instead He questions them.

Then for Adam to answer he can begin to understand and process ""where"" he is in relationship to God versus where he was. Adam's position has changed, and he is not in the same place physically or spiritually.

God does this throughout scripture where He asks a question he already knows the answer to, but it is to the benefit of the hearer that he asked the question.

There are many scriptures where God asks questions, but indeed already knows the answer. Here are a few:

Genesis 4:6 NKJV


  So the Lord said to Cain, “Why are you angry? And why
  has your countenance fallen? 


Genesis 4:9-10 NKJV


  9 Then the Lord said to Cain, “Where is Abel your brother?” He said,
  “I do not know. Am I my brother’s keeper?” 10 And He said, “What have
  you done? The voice of your brother’s blood cries out to Me from the
  ground.


1 Kings 19:9-10 NKJV


  9 And there he went into a cave, and spent the
  night in that place; and behold, the word of the Lord came to him, and
  He said to him, “What are you doing here, Elijah?” 10 So he said, “I
  have been very zealous for the Lord God of hosts; for the children of
  Israel have forsaken Your covenant, torn down Your altars, and killed

1552,1552,2434,Does changing the gap between plates change the capacitor voltage?,"Consider an ideal capacitor which has a length of \$\ell_1\$ between its plates. The capacitor terminals are open; they are not connected to any finite valued impedance. Its capacity is \$C_1\$ and it has an initial voltage of \$V_1\$.

What happens to the capacitor voltage if we make the gap between the plates \$\ell_2=2\ell_1\$ without changing the amount of charge on the plates?



My thoughts on this:

Increasing the gap will decrease the capacitance.

$$ C_2 = \dfrac{C_1}{2} $$

Since the amount of charge is unchanged, the new capacitor voltage will be

$$ V_2 = \dfrac{Q}{C_2} = \dfrac{Q}{\dfrac{C_1}{2}} = 2\dfrac{Q}{C_1} = 2V_1. $$

Is this true? Can we change the capacitor voltage just by moving its plates? For example, suppose that I'm wearing plastic shoes and I have some amount of charge on my body. This will naturally cause a static voltage, since my body and the ground act as capacitor plates. Now, if I climb a perfect insulator building (e.g.; a dry tree), will the static voltage on my body increase?

I don't understand that since it wouldn't be operating off my hard drive, it would be running from the CD/flash drive.

Does anyone have any clues on what I can do to check this out? I'm tempted to buy a new hard drive and RAM, but would hate to buy something I can't return if they aren't the issue.

I'm stuck...any help would be very appreciated. Thanks so much and have a wonderful weekend.
","For testing ram -> boot from the cd/usb and hold down a key (it will load and give option for testing memory) Memtest with Ubuntu 12.04 live CD  For hard drive boot all the way to the ubuntu and in programs there will be a program called disks #(in disks click on the drive then the cog symbol and choose SMART) data or gparted.

We've also asked that they add a new plumbing vent stack for a new bathroom we'll add later, a bathroom exhaust vent, a whirlybird to vent the attic, a dryer vent, and supports in case we want to install a roof deck later. 

This is a 4 floor row house with shallow pitch roof in mid-Atlantic US. There's a 6"" to 3' pitched attic area with r30 batts on the ceiling joists. Also have HVAC compressor on roof and unit in attic. 

What else should we think about along these lines? Green roof supports? Solar panel mounts? Additional insulation? What should we prepare for now, or at least consider?
",jlpp,https://diy.stackexchange.com/users/535,"The three things that I ask people to consider when they're replacing a roof is if they're in a wind or hail damage region, and if they're in a region with high solar gain (such as Texas) or an area prone to ice damming (such as New England or the upper midwest.)

If you're in an area that is prone to wind or hail damage (thunderstorms or hurricanes), you might want to look into a more resilient form of roofing material. Stone-coated steel shingles (which look just like standard asphalt shingles) are a great product that will resist most forms of damage that can be dished out. Your insurance may give you a discount on them because they have a longer lifetime. 

If you're in a high solar gain area, look into some of the energy-star rated shingles. They again look just like stone coated asphalt shingles, but they'll help keep your attic cool in the summertime. 

If you're in an area that gets a decent amount of snow, make sure that they install an ice &amp; water barrier around any roof penetrations (like skylights or places where they replace a vent) and along the edge of the roof where you could develop ice damming problems. This material is a sticky membrane that self-sticks to the roof deck and basically keeps water from seeping through at all. Common brand name for this product are ""Grace Ice &amp; Water Shield"" ... I also personally use it in roof valleys, gable crotches, and several other places where water tends to get blown up inside something and you really don't want it to soak through. 

You definitely want to get your insulation up to the max, but that's something that you can do at any time using blown-in insulation. If you are replacing roof decking and have it open, you should make sure that you have plenty of soffit vents and that your soffit vents are baffled properly. (I like the Berger Accuvent, personally...) 

You want to make sure that any damaged or rusted flashing is replaced, and that tar paper is replaced. Look into what kind of tar paper they're using (heavier the weight, the better...), because that's actually your roof. Make sure you know what kind of valleys you're getting.

When I first purchased my bike, I knew I needed to lube my chain when i did regular maintenance.  I purchased some White Lightning Self Cleaning Bicycle lube, which suggested to me that I only needed to put that lube on the chain and everything would be fine.  

I recently purchased another brand of lube, and it didn't say anything about self cleaning.  I've read in several places that a degreaser is needed and a cloth and some soap to clean a chain properly, and then lubing takes place afterwards.

",meltdownmonk,https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/users/4883,"I've used white lightening and thought it was good.

I do get through wax based lubes faster than oil - you have to reapply more often. Compared to the faff of oil based lubes though, it seems worth it.

You do have to still clean your chain and cogs off every so often. How often depends on the weather, distance and type of terrain you've been cycling through. But, it seems like far less mess and time is required than oil based lubes. To clean I soak the chain in a mix of hot water, washing up liquid and something like kitchen/hob surface cleaner.

",user44947,https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/44947,"According to http://www.verticallearning.org/curriculum/science/gr7/student/unit01/page05.html , the average velocity of a water molecule at 20C is approximately 590 m/s:



If you now calculate the difference in mass between water molecules ""at rest"" and moving at 590 m/s, this ratio is given by

If I add $modalInstance.close to Modal1
while Opening another modal that is Modal2, Modal1 is Closed and Modal2 is Opened But none of the buttons work. Modal3 doesnt get opened Don't Know the actual issue what is happening.

Please help me. Thanks in advance.
","From Main Controller First Open Your Modal1,on Close of Modal1 i.e

 var modalInstance = $modal.open({
                templateUrl: 'abc',
                controller: 'abcCtrl',
                size: 'lg',
                scope: $scope,
             });

            modalInstance.result.then(function(result) {
                  $scope.def();
              }, function(err) {
                //
            });

  $scope.def = function(){
     //open another 
    }


call another function and in that function open another modal and similarly you can do.

""Units are relative. And according to Fourier Transforms, units can be changed so Light year is a unit of time.""

That got me thinking and I read up Fourier Transforms on wikipedia but couldn't find anything about using a unit in one domain as a unit for another measurement. I do agree that units (particularly, base units are relative. eg: the meter), but does his statement make any sense?

Thank you everyone for all the answers. It isn't so much to in it in or prove a point as it is to understand the concept better. Anyways this is his response after I showed him this thread. Any comments would be appreciated.

His response:
Nevermind, for the first time I accept I was wrong. BUT using lightyears to measure time is possible. My example didn't make sense bacause I was wrong when I meantioned that I'm still measuring dist. If you have a signal in time domain and ...take the FT, I get a signal which DOES NOT HAVE to be in frequency domain. Clarify this to the guy who posted last. Now the new signal is in a domain defined by me and so is its units. This signal although not equal to the original signal, still represents that if ya take an inverse FT. So, the idea of time will still be there. Now coming back to our case: lightyears here is not the lightyears you are used to read when dealing with distance. It represents time.
",xbonez,https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/436,"He's BS-ing you to the extent that an explanation of the fourier transform is not necessary to point this out (""units are relative"" - what like length and time are the same thing? then all unit definitions would be circular as length is defined in terms of time at present. is mass also length? can you give my height, weight, and age in one number and define each as the same number in different units? =) ). I'll be specific though, anyway. The fourier transform of a scalar number is simply not defined (no such thing as a fourier transform of a distance, for instance). Typically fourier transforms give you a function of frequency for every function of time or of space. Under certain conditions, where there is a relationship between spatial frequency and temporal frequency (like waves propagating in a nondispersive medium here wavelength*frequency = speed of waves) you can then get a function of time for any function of space using a fourier transform, indirectly. But this is a special case, involves functions, not numbers, and this fourier transform of the original function is NOT THE SAME as the original function, so it's irrelevant to your original argument. So your friend is screwing with you.

","He told you that the explanation of Fourier transform doesn't have to point out this (""the units are relative"") - is the length the same as the time?

Can you use a number to express my height, weight and age, and define them as the same number in different units? =I'll be more specific, though. Scalar Fourier transform is undefined (for example, Fourier transform without distance). Generally, Fourier transform provides a frequency function for each function of time or space. Under some conditions, if there is a relationship between space frequency and time frequency (just as wave propagates in nondispersive media, where wavelength * frequency = wave speed), then the time function of any function in space can be obtained indirectly by using Fourier transform.

If a trigger is not firing, then the insert/update/delete of the SObject is failing before the trigger is being invoked. For example, an after insert/update trigger will not fire if there are validation rule errors during the insert/update.  Or, if the before insert/update triggers execute an add.error to prevent the DML from committing.

Given that it works in stage but not PROD, you need to verify that Stage mirrors PROD in terms of validation rules and workflow field updates.

Another thing to check is that if the stage testmethod uses @isTest(SeeAllData=true) it is highly likely to have different behavior in PROD than in Stage where the dataset size will be different.

4078,4078,6510,How to reduce vehicle swaying (body sway),"I have a stock 2010 acura tsx. I dont know what the official term is (maybe body sway) but i would like to reduce the amount of swaying it does as im going through turns, especially at higher speeds. Its that feeling of your head bobbing from side to side as your whipping through turns (and what makes me dizzy if i keep it up long enough). 

I had a 96 acura integra before that i put an aftermarket strut bar in the front. Not sure how much that helped but my teggy hugged the road and i could whip through turns quickly with very little sway. I realize that the tsx is higher up and i cant expect it to handle like an integra but what can i do to reduce the swaying? Do i replace the front or rear strut bar or something else? 
",n00b,https://mechanics.stackexchange.com/users/1150,"You are very close to answering your own question:

What you're looking for is an upgraded sway bar.  This is ""... usually a torsion spring that resists body roll motions.""  This is in contrast to a strut bar ""... designed to reduce ... strut tower flex by tying two parallel strut towers together.""

In general, if your goal is to reduce body roll, one of the cheapest ways to do so is to upgrade the sway bar(s).  Strut tower bars will have a much more limited effect and should usually be considered after upgrading tires, sway bars, struts and springs (i.e., much later).

Caveat: increasing the roll stiffness will change your under/oversteering biases.  Specifically, a stiffer bar in the front generally increases understeer.  Likewise, a stiffer rear will increase oversteer.  That said, I had a 97 Integra some time back and installed an adjustable rear sway bar.  I adored its steering responsiveness in the summer but also managed to scare myself several times in the winter....

2152,2152,3430,Change in Wavelength of a Photon Relation to Energy (specifically Compton Effect),"Given a photon dropping from $\lambda_1$ to $\lambda_2$, its energy will drop from $\frac{hc}{(\lambda_1)}$ to $\frac{hc}{(\lambda_2)}$. However, I was wondering if there is any significance in the energy of the change in wavelength itself. For $\Delta \lambda = \lambda_2 - \lambda_1$, this change in wavelength has an energy $\frac{hc}{(\Delta \lambda)}$, yet this value does not correspond at all (as far as I can see) with $\Delta E = \frac{hc}{(\lambda_1)} -\frac{hc}{(\lambda_2)}$. Is this just a subtlety in the math, or is there actually meaning behind the value $\frac{hc}{(\Delta \lambda)}$?
",A4Treok,https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/35507,"One common way that this happens is through spontaneous parametric down-conversion.

From Wiki: an important process in quantum optics, used especially as a source of entangled photon pairs, and of single photons. A nonlinear crystal is used to split photons into pairs of photons that, in accordance with the law of conservation of energy, have combined energies and momenta equal to the energy and momentum of the original photon, are phase-matched in the frequency domain, and have correlated polarizations.

Say an example of a photon dropping from λ1 to λ2:
* a green photon λ1=630 nanometers, hc/λ1 = 1.97 evolts
* splits in two and one photon is λ2=830 nanometers, hc/λ2 = 1.49 evolts

However, I wonder if the energy of the wavelength change itself makes sense. For $\ Delta \ lambda = \ lambda ﹣ 2 - \ lambda ﹣ 1 $, this change in wavelength has an energy of $\ frac {HC} {(\ Delta \ lambda)} $, but this value does not correspond to $\ delta e = \ frac {HC} {(\ lambda ﹣) - \ frac {HC} {(\ lambda})} $. Is this just a subtlety in mathematics, or is it practical after the value $\ frac {HC} {(\ Delta \ lambda)} $?","One common way that this happens is through spontaneous parametric down-conversion.

From Wiki: an important process in quantum optics, used especially as a source of entangled photon pairs, and of single photons. A nonlinear crystal is used to split photons into pairs of photons that, in accordance with the law of conservation of energy, have combined energies and momenta equal to the energy and momentum of the original photon, are phase-matched in the frequency domain, and have correlated polarizations.

Say an example of a photon dropping from λ1 to λ2:
* a green photon λ1=630 nanometers, hc/λ1 = 1.97 evolts
* splits in two and one photon is λ2=830 nanometers, hc/λ2 = 1.49 evolts

The difference in energy, hc/λ1-hc/λ2 = 0.48 evolts and would end up with the other photon. the other photons wave length would be 2583 nanometers based on its 0.48 evolts energy.

The difference you reference Δλ = λ2−λ1 of 200 nanometers converted to hc/Δλ is quite high at 6.2 evolts. There is not much sense to the quantity hc/Δλ and I dont think there is any particular meaning to it.

I was hoping that it was just a matter of adding a ""--localInputDir"" directive to the command line would fix things. However, this seems unrelated to where the Tomcat server is trying to upload.

How do I modify the stand-alone binary so that I am able to successfully ingest sample data for training?
",Matthew Reinbold,https://stackoverflow.com/users/224351,"I have heard of this before but not been able to reproduce it. For some reason, the temp dir that Tomcat allocates is either not actually created, or not accessible.

You can try deleting that whole directory starting with ""137..."" to ensure that Tomcat makes another new one. Or try investigating this path to see if you can create and/or make accessible that temp dir.

This should be controlled by Tomcat's javax.servlet.context.tempdir system property. You could also try setting that to somewhere else like /tmp.

As far as I know it's some oddness with Tomcat and Windows, but it may be transient and fixable per above.

338,338,540,How do I tell the difference between a borrowed chord and a key change?,"Having muddled through for a few years, I'm finally learning the basics of harmony. I'm having a bit of trouble, though understanding exactly what goes on when chords occur from outside the key. Is the key changing? Or are these 'borrowed' chords, and in which case, how are they decided on?

For example, see the classic ""I Can't Forget"" by Leonard Cohen.


            
                
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    
                
            

Here is an apparently accurate transcription of the chords in the verse:

http://www.maartenmassa.be/CohenChords/09iym/i_cant_forget.htm

    F#
I stumbled out of bed
       D#m
I got ready for the struggle
F#
I smoked a cigarette
     D#m               C#
And I tightened up my gut
   B         Bm       G#m
I said this can't be me
 A#          E    D#m
Must be my double
F#              B    
And I can't forget... (etc)


OK, so I see I-vi-I-vi-V of F# major, taking us to the line ""I said this can't be me"". This makes sense to me. But what happens then? 

It seems to modulate to B minor - fine, I think we're heading for a scale with B minor in it, ie A major, D major(/B minor),  or G major. But this is followed immediately by G#m, though, so it's not any of those (maybe we're back in F#?), but then we get A#!? E? 

I am totally confused at this point as to what key we're in.

It's particularly galling as the change to A# is my favourite chord change in the song, and the whole run from B to D#m, and then back to F#, is weirdly satisfying.

Can anyone explain what's going on here?
",djb,https://music.stackexchange.com/users/10437,"This seems to be just an unusual chord sequence  (ie, one that we're not used to hearing) within some otherwise fairly natural sounding chords.

I's say this isn't a key change. The next verse starts on the same chord (F#) and does the same thing so the context of the chord sequence doens't change.

At least until the end of second verse (I haven't listened further), the song is in the key F#.. major ? Only because that';s how the first line is sung (ish, he'sa bit wobbly lol).

F#major and Dm scales don't share a heck of a lot of notes, and the sequence does this kind of thing elsewhere so it seems he's going for a notion of breaking some rules and having it sound like it all fits together.

I think he's succeeded !

For example, see the classic ""I Can't Forget"" by Leonard Cohen.


            
                
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    
                
            

Here is an apparently accurate transcription of the chords in the verse:

http://www.maartenmassa.be/CohenChords/09iym/i_cant_forget.htm

    F#
I stumbled out of bed
       D#m
I got ready for the struggle
F#
I smoked a cigarette
     D#m               C#
And I tightened up my gut
   B         Bm       G#m
I said this can't be me
 A#          E    D#m
Must be my double
F#              B    
And I can't forget... (etc)


OK, so I see I-vi-I-vi-V of F# major, taking us to the line ""I said this can't be me"". This makes sense to me. But what happens then? 

It seems to modulate to B minor - fine, I think we're heading for a scale with B minor in it, ie A major, D major(/B minor),  or G major. But this is followed immediately by G#m, though, so it's not any of those (maybe we're back in F#?), but then we get A#!? E? 

I am totally confused at this point as to what key we're in.

It's particularly galling as the change to A# is my favourite chord change in the song, and the whole run from B to D#m, and then back to F#, is weirdly satisfying.

Can anyone explain what's going on here?
","This seems to be just an unusual chord sequence  (ie, one that we're not used to hearing) within some otherwise fairly natural sounding chords.

I's say this isn't a key change. The next verse starts on the same chord (F#) and does the same thing so the context of the chord sequence doens't change.

At least until the end of second verse (I haven't listened further), the song is in the key F#.. major ? Only because that';s how the first line is sung (ish, he'sa bit wobbly lol).

F#major and Dm scales don't share a heck of a lot of notes, and the sequence does this kind of thing elsewhere so it seems he's going for a notion of breaking some rules and having it sound like it all fits together.

I think he's succeeded !

1590,1590,2506,Intangibility in Marvel Heroic Roleplaying,"I am playing the Breakout event, as Spiderman (stop reading if you don't want spoilers!). We just met Zzzax, and I decided to attack him by web-throwing a huge metal pipe through him. I managed a Total 28, effect d10 action and aimed for Physical Stress.

The Watcher did a Reaction Roll, and got a Total 2, Effect d4 Reaction (yes, it is possible, only one die not an opportunity).

But the Watcher activated its ""Grounded"" Limit: Zzzax ignored all Stress, and became grounded through the pipe. And here is the disagreement:

His point of view: Since Zzzax has Intangibility d10, he ignores all physical attacks, the only way to defeat him is to activate his Limit and then over-complicate him. He activated the Limit because my roll was so high that it should have a result. He still has Intangibility even though his Power Set is shut down.

My point of view: Activating a Limit doesn't allow you to randomly ignore an attack. I can't ignore an attack and become Exhausted instead. Intangibility is just a die to add to Reaction rolls, not an automatic effect that allows you to ignore everything, that requires an SFX like Immunity(Physical attacks).

I went with his interpretation (and built a Faraday cage through web and pipes), but I still think that it was not right.

So how does Intangibility work? Is it an automatic effect, even without Immunity/Invulnerability SFXs, or is it just a resistance, allowing you to be attacked normally?

My commutative diagram below is 90% complete.  I would, however, like text={${gKer({\varphi}){\mapsto}{\varphi(G)}}$} following the path below the arrow and \cong following the path above the same arrow.

\end{document}

","I would suggest you tu use the tikz-cd package for your commutative diagrams; also, since the problematic label is not really the name of a map, but rather its action, I would also suggest you to describe the map outside the diagram (otherwise, the diagram might result too crowded):

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\usepackage{tikz-cd}

\DeclareMathOperator{\Ker}{Ker}

\begin{document}

\[
\begin{tikzcd}
G\arrow[twoheadrightarrow]{r}{\varphi}\arrow{d}{\pi} &amp; G' \\
G/\Ker(\varphi)\arrow[sloped,swap]{ur}[near start]{\tau}[swap]{\cong}
\end{tikzcd}
\]
where $\tau:G/\Ker(\varphi)\rightarrow G'$ is defined by $g\Ker({\varphi}){\mapsto}{\varphi(G)}$.

\end{document}




Of course, you can draw the diagram with the originally requested labels, perhaps increasing the distance between nodes:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\usepackage{tikz-cd}

\DeclareMathOperator{\Ker}{Ker}

\begin{document}

\[
\begin{tikzcd}[row sep=60pt,column sep=huge]
G\arrow[twoheadrightarrow]{r}{\varphi}\arrow{d}{\pi} &amp; G' \\
G/\Ker(\varphi)\arrow[sloped,swap]{ur}[pos=0.15]{g\Ker({\varphi}){\mapsto}{\varphi(G)}}[swap]{\cong}
\end{tikzcd}
\]

\end{document}

3045,3045,4853,Why was a resistor and capacitor used in this IR receiver circuit,"

The circuit shows an IR receiver whose output pin is interfaced with a PIC. Can you explain why a resistor and capacitor were used and why those values were picked.
",user39463,https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/39463,"As the datasheet clearly says, the TSOP output is open collector.  This means it needs a passive pullup to go high.

However, the circuit you show is messed up in several ways.  Assuming whatever you find on the internet to be good coupled with not reading the datasheet leads to trouble.  Specifically, problems with this circuit are:

100 &Omega; is a really low value for the pullup.  The TSOP would have to sink 50 mA to bring that low.  That's so much that I would not assume the TSOP can do that unless the datasheet explicitly says so.  In any case, that much current is totally unnecessary.  10 k&Omega; would be a much better pullup value.

100&micro;F on the output line is excessive, and totally unnecessary.  The circuitry inside the TSOP already produces a clear digital output that does not bounce.  There is no point in filtering that output further.  Perhaps that cap was intended to be between power and ground, but that's not what the schematic shows.

There is no decoupling cap.  Again, read the TSOP datahseet.  If I remember right, this even specifies a minimum decoupling capacitance.  C1 may have been intended to be between power and ground, which would make a lot more sense than where it is shown.

It shows me the icon on the desired location, however without the marker or the description and snippets. The following line

mMap.addMarker(MarkerOptions().position(location)
    .title(poi.getName()).snippet(poi.getDescription())
    .icon(BitmapDescriptorFactory.fromBitmap(image_item));


shows me only the icon without the title or snippest.

3147,3147,5012,How difficult is it to undertake a Humanities PhD. at Harvard (converting to the American system from Europe/UK?),"Before I begin, feel I should make it clear that I have no doubt that undertaking a PhD. anywhere, let alone at Harvard, will be a difficult and strenuous task!

To briefly explain, I have graduated with a good Bachelors of Arts from the UK, and am set to do my Research Masters in Holland. However, I have been in contact and have contacted the literature faculties in Harvard, who have been very encouraging but, to be honest, the system itself seems very different.

To clarify, I'll copy in some of what my (possible) supervisor has emailed me:

Our students enter the program, take two or three years of courses, and only then settle on a dissertation topic and choose a committee of three faculty -- one primary advisor and two other readers.

This sounds at once much more fluid and liberal a way of doing things, but, considering the ridiculous costs of studying in the USA, I'm not sure how leisurely that would be in reality! Should I assume that Doctoral programs in the USA are like a Masters leading into a PhD? Is there a scholarship available for both of these?

The code is compiling and running correctly, this is standard output:

Stack is empty, you must PUSH an element before POPping one! 
Popped Element: -1 
Stack Top is: 1 
Stack Top is: 2 
Stack Top is: 3 
Stack is full, you must POP an element before PUSHing a new one! 
Stack Top is: 3 
Popped Element: 3 
Stack Top is: 2 
Popped Element: 2 
Stack Top is: 1 
Popped Element: 1 
Stack is empty, you must PUSH an element before PEEKing one! 
Stack Top is: -1


However I was given a B due to the following reasons:


There was a better way of implementing it. 
I didn't manage well the case in which I'm trying to POP an element from an empty stack, since it's confusing that pop() returns a value even if Stack is empty.


Can you please help me understand how I could improve my code?
",Matteo,https://codereview.stackexchange.com/users/22916,"this is not always needed in member functions, you can remove all the 

this-&gt;


The compiler knows this from the context.

And move brackets, e.g.:

int myStaticIntStack::peek() {
    if( 0 == storedElements ){
        cout &lt;&lt; ""Stack is empty, you must PUSH an element before PEEKing one!"" &lt;&lt; endl;
        return -1;
    }
    else{
        return elements[stackSize - storedElements ];
    }
}


In comparisons, the const is safer on the left.  This avoids a possible =, which is a common error.

You could improve it by making a vector class. You may have to do this from scratch if it is homework. It would be better than old C arrays.

The code is compiling and running correctly, this is standard output:

Stack is empty, you must PUSH an element before POPping one! 
Popped Element: -1 
Stack Top is: 1 
Stack Top is: 2 
Stack Top is: 3 
Stack is full, you must POP an element before PUSHing a new one! 
Stack Top is: 3 
Popped Element: 3 
Stack Top is: 2 
Popped Element: 2 
Stack Top is: 1 
Popped Element: 1 
Stack is empty, you must PUSH an element before PEEKing one! 
Stack Top is: -1


However I was given a B due to the following reasons:


There was a better way of implementing it. 
I didn't manage well the case in which I'm trying to POP an element from an empty stack, since it's confusing that pop() returns a value even if Stack is empty.


Can you please help me understand how I could improve my code?
","this is not always needed in member functions, you can remove all the 

this-&gt;


The compiler knows this from the context.

And move brackets, e.g.:

int myStaticIntStack::peek() {
    if( 0 == storedElements ){
        cout &lt;&lt; ""Stack is empty, you must PUSH an element before PEEKing one!"" &lt;&lt; endl;
        return -1;
    }
    else{
        return elements[stackSize - storedElements ];
    }
}


In comparisons, the const is safer on the left.  This avoids a possible =, which is a common error.

You could improve it by making a vector class. You may have to do this from scratch if it is homework. It would be better than old C arrays.

4534,4534,7185,event horizons are untraversable by observers far from the collapse?,"Consider this a followup question of this one

In the classical schwarszchild solution with an eternal black hole, the user falls through the event horizon in finite local time, but this event does take place for distant observers in the infinite future. As Leonard Susskind explains, measurements of objects near the horizon are subject to large uncertainties, since all the radiation used to see them is largely red-shifted and received in increasingly large intervals in the future. This is why in some still vaguely defined sense, the effective event horizon grows, even if no matter has actually yet crossed the original event horizon (the stable event horizon after the black hole collapse period)

But when the event horizon radiates, the event horizon must recede faster than any infalling observer. Any infalling matter will probably be still stir-fried by the hawking radiation over the eons the evaporation takes (which in the observer frame is intensely blue shifted). The only matter that ever gets to be inside the formal event horizon (not the effective horizon) before the final evaporation is the matter that was already in the original collapsing star, around which the event horizon formed

Is there still any room to say otherwise? can still be argued that matter will fall in the event horizon in finite time for distant observers (faster than the evaporation will shrink the event horizon)?
",lurscher,https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/955,"It's key to remember that the observer outside of the black hole will never see you fall into the black hole.  However, this observer can jump into the black hole himself, and see what happened to you.  Outside of the black hole, since he is unable to receive light signals from you, he may say that you have stopped at the event horizon.  But since he can go in and see you (assuming you haven't been crushed by the singularity yet), it is a matter of philosophy of whether the infalling observer actually fell in or if he 'froze' at the event horizon.

Analogy: If you are accelerating in a rocket, you don't have to believe that time on earth slowed to a stop corresponding to your Rindler horizon. If you wish, you can conclude no such thing. However, it is indisputable that no signals from earth past a certain time will reach you as long as you continue accelerating. But you can stop accelerating and then see what you missed. Similarly, you can 'stop accelerating away from the SC horizon' - i.e. fall into it - and then see all the history of infaller's you missed.

In the classical schwarszchild solution with an eternal black hole, the user falls through the event horizon in finite local time, but this event does take place for distant observers in the infinite future. As Leonard Susskind explains, measurements of objects near the horizon are subject to large uncertainties, since all the radiation used to see them is largely red-shifted and received in increasingly large intervals in the future. This is why in some still vaguely defined sense, the effective event horizon grows, even if no matter has actually yet crossed the original event horizon (the stable event horizon after the black hole collapse period)

But when the event horizon radiates, the event horizon must recede faster than any infalling observer. Any infalling matter will probably be still stir-fried by the hawking radiation over the eons the evaporation takes (which in the observer frame is intensely blue shifted). The only matter that ever gets to be inside the formal event horizon (not the effective horizon) before the final evaporation is the matter that was already in the original collapsing star, around which the event horizon formed

Is there still any room to say otherwise? can still be argued that matter will fall in the event horizon in finite time for distant observers (faster than the evaporation will shrink the event horizon)?
","It's key to remember that the observer outside of the black hole will never see you fall into the black hole.  However, this observer can jump into the black hole himself, and see what happened to you.  Outside of the black hole, since he is unable to receive light signals from you, he may say that you have stopped at the event horizon.  But since he can go in and see you (assuming you haven't been crushed by the singularity yet), it is a matter of philosophy of whether the infalling observer actually fell in or if he 'froze' at the event horizon.

Analogy: If you are accelerating in a rocket, you don't have to believe that time on earth slowed to a stop corresponding to your Rindler horizon. If you wish, you can conclude no such thing. However, it is indisputable that no signals from earth past a certain time will reach you as long as you continue accelerating. But you can stop accelerating and then see what you missed. Similarly, you can 'stop accelerating away from the SC horizon' - i.e. fall into it - and then see all the history of infaller's you missed.

5993,5993,9501,Group isomorphisms and a possible trivial statement?,"I have the following set $G=\lbrace a,b,e \rbrace$ and I successfully computed the following Cayley-Table \begin{align} \begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|}

Now $(G, \circ)$ forms a group. When talking about homomorphisms I learned that a mapping is considered a homomorphism if $\varphi: G \to G'$ is a mapping such that $\forall a,b \in G, \varphi(a \circ b) = \varphi(a) \circ' \varphi(b)$.

So I was asked to show that the group $(G, \circ)$ of order 3 is isomorph to the group $(G', \circ ')$ where $G' = \lbrace c,d,e' \rbrace$.

So it is trivial to notice that $\varphi$ is bijective. It also follows easily (I've done the calculations) that $\varphi$ is homomorphism, using the same Cayley table as above and replacing all letters by $c,d,e'$ respectively. Therefore $\varphi$ is an isomorphism. 



My question now is, what have I done? If this approach was even remotely correct, then I wonder what my statement now is saying. I have found an isomorphism between $G$ and $G'$ and therefore they have the same structure. But I defined them from the beginning as groups of the same order and even used the same Cayley-table. 

The only relevance I can see in this is that I made no statement about $c,d,e'$ at all, so I never said that they must be equal or even related to $a,b,e$.

1103,1103,1736,why ions and electrons are at different temperatures in plasma?,"In plasma, collision rate among ions or electrons is much larger than the collision rate between ions and electrons. why is that so?
",seeking_infinity,https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/57676,"Consider a plasma that just's been formed and then left alone. Being far from equilibrium, the plasma will evolve towards an equilibrium state. At this stage, it's not very useful to characterize the plasma with a temperature because the velocity distribution would bear little resemblance to a Boltzmann distribution, or really any kind of distribution function with meaningful moments. 

Let's assume that the plasma is being driven towards equilibrium by collision events. The particles will lose energy during each inelastic collision event, with some being more inelastic than others. The degree of inelasticity will depend significantly on the mass ratio: ion-ion collisions and electron-electron collisions will be inelastic compared to ion-electron collisions.

Since the $i-i$ and $e-e$ collisions are relatively inelastic, it often occurs that the ions and electrons quickly develop their own ""temperatures"". The ion velocity distribution rapidly approaches a Boltzmann distribution with temperature, and the electrons also rapidly approach a Boltzmann distribution with some different temperature. If you were to superpose the two, you'd get a funny-looking distribution with a tall top and wide tails, i.e. not global equilibrium. 

The ""centeredness"" or ""tailedness"" (basically kurtosis) of the total distribution tells you how far from equilibrium the plasma is. The further the system is from equilibrium, the faster it will try to equilibrate via collisions. So if the temperatures are very different, the $i-e$ collision frequency will be high. If the temperatures are not too different, the $i-e$ will be lower, but still higher than the $e-e$ and $i-i$ systems that have already approximately equilibrated with themselves.

Note: In laboratory experiments, it's common to produce plasmas whose ions and electrons do not settle to a Boltzmann distribution. In that case, the kurtosis argument flies out the window. Another major complication arises if the electrons and ions have different flow speeds, where so-called ""two-stream"" or ""bump-on-tail"" instabilities become important in the equilibration physics.

1698,1698,2689,How do people know what they can get out of trade up contracts?,"I hear people say ""I can get this or that out of these skins"" but how do you know what you can get out of a skin?
",Emilian,https://gaming.stackexchange.com/users/110922,"The Concept

The whole idea of trade-up's are pretty simple. It provides an alternative to simply opening cases or trading weapons with other players. In order to use the trade-up contracts, all you need is 10 weapons of the same grade.

Weapon Grades

The grades go in the following order:


  Consumer Grade > Industrial grade > Mil-spec > Restricted > Classified > Covert 


How it works?

Essentially, if you were to use 10 weapons of the Restricted quality, you will get 1 weapon of the Classified quality. If you were to use 10 weapons of Classified quality, you will get a single Covert weapon. Etc.

Here is an example:

Scrolling over an item in your inventory reveals a list. Something like this: 

This is called a ""Collection"". Basically, if I were to trade up 10 M4A1-S| Atomic Alloys, I would have a 50-50 chance of getting either a AK-47| Vulcan or a M4A4| Desert-Strike.

What about weapons of different collections?

Simple. Having more weapons of different collections in the same contract means that there are more different variations of weapons if you get. If I were to throw in 5 M4A1-S| Atomic Alloys and another 5 M4A4| Dragon Kings: 



I have a chance of getting the following weapons:


  
  AK-47| Vulcan
  M4A4| Desert-Strike
  AWP| Man-o'-War
  Galil AR| Chatterbox
  


To conclude,

Basically all you need to remember is that when you place weapons of lets say Collection A into a contract, you will get 1 of any weapon that belongs in Collection A. Just that it will be 1 grade ""Better"".

Extra:


Knives, which have the grade Exceedingly Rare ★, CANNOT be used in contracts
You can now use Stat-Trak weapons in Trade-ups
I am not entirely sure, but I believe that ""Wild-Card"" skins, are essentially that one or two unwanted skins that have been placed in the contract just so as to fill it up. Since there is only 1 or 2 of them there is a low chance of their collection being picked, but still, it is possible. Hence they are ""affectionately"" referred to as ""Wild-Card"" skins.

Simple. Having more weapons of different collections in the same contract means that there are more different variations of weapons if you get. If I were to throw in 5 M4A1-S| Atomic Alloys and another 5 M4A4| Dragon Kings: 



I have a chance of getting the following weapons:


  
  AK-47| Vulcan
  M4A4| Desert-Strike
  AWP| Man-o'-War
  Galil AR| Chatterbox
  


To conclude,

Basically all you need to remember is that when you place weapons of lets say Collection A into a contract, you will get 1 of any weapon that belongs in Collection A. Just that it will be 1 grade ""Better"".

Extra:


Knives, which have the grade Exceedingly Rare ★, CANNOT be used in contracts
You can now use Stat-Trak weapons in Trade-ups
I am not entirely sure, but I believe that ""Wild-Card"" skins, are essentially that one or two unwanted skins that have been placed in the contract just so as to fill it up. Since there is only 1 or 2 of them there is a low chance of their collection being picked, but still, it is possible. Hence they are ""affectionately"" referred to as ""Wild-Card"" skins.

4143,4143,6611,Equivalent Key Signatures,"I've noticed that a variety of pieces in the classical repetoire (certainly at least the piano repetoire), label what seems to be effectively the same key signature differently. That is, I am not aware of any differences in terms of key between a piece in ""G Sharp major"" and ""A flat major"" (or their equivalent minors). Is there any reason that sometimes a sharped key signature is used while at other times the equivalent flatted key signature is used?

As a related point, I have undoubtedly noticed the preference of certain ""equivalent"" key signatures over others. For example, one encounters ""E flat"" significantly more than ""D sharp"" and likewise ""C sharp"" significantly more than ""D flat"". Is there any particular reason for this, or is it simply a convention that has been handed down to use through musical history?
",Noldorin,https://music.stackexchange.com/users/179,"The short (and oversimplified) answer is: Because Ab Major has fewer flats than G# Major has sharps, and thus it's easier for musicians to read.  This becomes especially apparent with keys such as D# Major, which has a double-sharp in it---the seventh note of the D# Major scale is not D, but Cx (that's ""C double-sharp"").

The longer and more accurate answer is that these keys are not in fact equivalent.  Only in an equal-tempered tuning system do G# and Ab have the same pitch, Eb and D# have the same pitch, etc.  That is, only in equal temperament do enharmonically equivalent notes actually have the same pitch.  In every other tuning system, the enharmonically equivalent notes are slightly (but definitely noticeably) different from each other.  If you've only been exposed to fixed-pitch instruments such as the piano and the guitar, this concept can be challenging at first, but violinists, wind, and brass players know that their intonation depends on the context of the key in which they're playing.

This in turn leads to different keys having different sonic characteristics.  In the modern, equal-tempered era, we've mostly lost these distinctions, but to composers of two hundred years ago and more, the keys of Ab and G# didn't sound the same at all, and they would compose to a specific key in order to take advantage of its particular character.

Update: In response to Brian's comment, I thought it would be helpful to post an example.  Here are links to YouTube videos, all three of which were posted by the same person, using the same synthesizer, all three playing Bach's Air on the G String.  But each link uses a different tuning system:

",user12352,https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/users/12352,"Here's a method that works and doesn't require anything other than basic InDesign features. 

It's pretty easy, but has a few steps, so, if you need to do this often, it might be worth looking into using scripts instead (see comments below) so you can do all of this with one click, not many.

1: In a copy of the file, remove all text that doesn't have this character style


Save a copy of the indesign file. We're going to make a mess of this file and you don't want to accidentally save over the real InDesign document.
Delete every character style in the character styles list except the one you're interested in. It'll ask you what to replace each one with. Replace each one with [none].
Open the Edit &gt; Find/Change window (ctrl-f). Switch to 'GREP'
In the Find what: box, enter .* (this will match everything). Leave 'Change to:' blank.
In Find formats, under Character Style, choose [none].
Hit Change all. Everything should be instantly deleted except the text in that one remaining character style.


2: Copy all the remaining text from this indesign file

Export as HTML and copy from there.


File &gt; Export
Choose the format to be HTML. Save this HTML file somewhere.
Open it up in a browser. It'll be a hideous monstrosity to look at - this doesn't matter.
Select all (normally ctrl-A). Copy. 
Paste into a plain text editor: e.g. Notepad if you're on Windows, or if you're on a Mac, Textedit after using Format &gt; Make Plain Text. This scrubs out all images and formatting, leaving just the text.
 6. Delete that hideous HTML page before anyone sees it...

  Brake horsepower (bhp) is the measure of an engine’s horsepower before the loss in power caused by the gearbox, alternator, differential, water pump, and other auxiliary components


So it’s not gear box or final drive that makes it more powerful.
",limovala,https://mechanics.stackexchange.com/users/3292,"There are two sides to the design and efficiency coin. As a rule of thumb, more modern motors would have better characteristics due to general improvements in manufacturing (machining tolerances are smaller, for instance), and engineering. Liquid-cooled motors are more efficient, as a rule, than air-cooled, and so forth. However, there are also other considerations.

For instance, I have a 250 cc standard motorcycle (Suzuki TU250X). It uses the same basic engine that Suzuki used on its small DR dual-sports, GN standards, and GZ cruisers since early 80s. However, for the new fuel-injected version that Suzuki introduced in the last few years, the newly re-designed top end (cylinder and head) caused it to make less horse-power than earlier carburetted versions (16 v. 20). Why so?

There are multiple factors for such re-design. First of all, the amount of valves were reduced from four to two. Obviously, it would reduce power, because the more, and the bigger the valves, the more air-fuel mixture can be brought in and out. However, the less valves means less maintenance. And for a commuter motorcycle, fuel economy was more important than sheer power.

Design of the valve openings and cam shaft was also rethought to produce more useful power band for this motorcycle. Having high theoretical horsepower does not mean that that power is readily available. Small sport-bikes and sport-like bikes like Duke, CBR250R or Ninja 250 capable of a lot more horsepower (25‒27 in stock form), however that horsepower is available at high RMP (8000‒10 000 or thereabouts), and in regular street riding it is never achieved, unless some one races by overreving the motor on lower gears. TU250X engine is designed to give mild and more even power band, that does not peak as high, but allows more useful power and torque at lower RPM one would use most often in regular urban traffic. As a result, this bike would not win any races and it takes awhile to get up to high speed (though people pushed it past 135 km/h (85 mph) while drafting), but it is a very capable commuter and easily allows over 200 kg of useful load (rider, passenger, and some gear).

Likewise, Bullet 350 affected by two of these factors: it has very old engine that harkens from 1950s, and it is a standard motorcycle workhorse that is designed for commuting, and not racing. Even the brand new RE 500 cc unit-construction engine with EFI is not that powerful for the same reason.

2061,2061,3284,Is Stormguard Warrior really that good?,"I have an idea of build centered around the Crusader class, with some possible dips in Warblade/Swordsage to take advantage of the goodies in other disciplines (such as Ironheart Surge or Time Stands Still).

The dip in the Warblade class brings me the opportunity to take the Stormguard Warrior tactical feat, and I have seen it recommended a number of times specifically for its Channel the Storm option (ToB, p.36):


  Channel the Storm: To use this option, you must choose to refrain from making one or more available attacks of opportunity against a single opponent. On your next turn, you gain a +4 bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls for each attack that you refrained from making against the same opponent. You gain this bonus only against an opponent that you refrained from making an attack of opportunity against in the previous round.


I am wondering if this feat is really that good. It seems that it requires a huge investment (in terms of feats) and it is unclear to me whether it really pays off.

The bonuses +4 AR/dmg per refrained AoO (which you have an infinite supply of (*)) do seem interesting, at first, however:


A prerequisite of Stormguard Warrior is Ironheart Aura, which in itself does not seem that interesting, especially for a Crusader (Thicket of Blade is not an Ironheart stance)
The bonuses gained can only be used against the opponent that generated them, and no other (it's a minor restriction, but worth keeping in mind)
An AoO is likely to do much more damage than 4, especially if using a two-handed weapon (even at level 1, we are looking at 1d10 + 6 ~= 11.5)


Thus, the two feats investment seems only worth it if one can generate more AoOs than one has available. In the recommendations I have seen, it is combined with Robilar's Gambit (-4 AR, 1 AoO per foe attack in melee) which itself requires Combat Reflexes. Dexterity is unlikely to be ignored (since it benefits Touch AC), and therefore we are looking at a minimum of 3 or 4 available AoOs per round...

Letting Combat Reflexes and Robilar's Gambit aside, is it really worth it investing in Ironheart Aura and Stormguard Warrior? Am I missing something?

(*) I have seen some debates where it is argued that refraining to take an AoO to fuel up Channel the Storm should use it up, which I ignore here. The feat is much worse in this case.
",Matthieu M.,https://rpg.stackexchange.com/users/1355,"Stormguard Warrior is an excellent feat – for building a character around

Stormguard Warrior can add huge amounts of attack and damage bonuses, but it requires that you be pretty dedicated towards generating attacks of opportunity to not take. Specifically, the feats Karmic StrikeCWar and Robilar’s GambitPHB2 are often used, because these feats allow you to take many more attacks of opportunity than you could otherwise (Karmic Strike allows you an AoO every time you’re hit, while Robilar’s Gambit allows you an AoO every time you’re attacked, whether they hit or not). Other ways of getting attacks of opportunity (defensive rebuke Devoted Spirit boostToB) or prevents others from avoiding them (thicket of blades stanceToB as mentioned, Mage Slayer featCArc) are also useful, but don’t add nearly as much as Karmic and/or Robilar’s.

But Ironheart Aura is pretty much a dead feat, yes, and without Karmic or Robilar’s, you’ll rarely see more than +4/+4 from Stormguard Warrior. +4/+4 for two feats isn’t entirely awful, of course; the Weapon Focus/Specialization line (which are awful) is four feats for +2/+4. If you have reach and thicket of blades, the +4/+4 seems pretty likely; using defensive rebuke can improve that dramatically. And it is pretty much expected that you’re using Power Attack with a big two-hander, so it’s really +0/+12. Basically, you’re trading extra attacks (attacks of opportunity) for more potent attacks in general (skip one AoO, get a full attack with +12 on each attack). So it’s not a terrible use of feats. Just not the highly-recommended one that it would be with Karmic and/or Robilar’s.

Also, note the Combat Rhythm option on Stormguard Warrior; it’s not nearly as explosive as Channel the Storm, but it is cool. Personally, I have always wanted to have that opportunity to combine it with avalanche of blades for hilarity. That’s not really an option for a crusader with a warblade dip, though.

The other thing to point out about Stormguard Warrior is that the Evasive Reflexes featToB uses the same “don’t take an AoO you could have, get something instead” mechanic, and like Stormguard Warrior, it doesn’t use up the AoO. You can use both Evasive Reflexes and Stormguard Warrior. This is particularly useful when you have thicket of blades – their 5-ft. steps provoke an AoO from you, which lets you 5-ft. step to keep up with them and gives you +4/+4. If that step was to try to get away from you so they could do something that provokes (say, cast a spell while you have Mage Slayer, or attack an ally after you hit them with defensive rebuke), you have either just prevented them from doing that, or are going to get pumped up even more.

The dip in the Warblade class brings me the opportunity to take the Stormguard Warrior tactical feat, and I have seen it recommended a number of times specifically for its Channel the Storm option (ToB, p.36):


  Channel the Storm: To use this option, you must choose to refrain from making one or more available attacks of opportunity against a single opponent. On your next turn, you gain a +4 bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls for each attack that you refrained from making against the same opponent. You gain this bonus only against an opponent that you refrained from making an attack of opportunity against in the previous round.


I am wondering if this feat is really that good. It seems that it requires a huge investment (in terms of feats) and it is unclear to me whether it really pays off.

The bonuses +4 AR/dmg per refrained AoO (which you have an infinite supply of (*)) do seem interesting, at first, however:


A prerequisite of Stormguard Warrior is Ironheart Aura, which in itself does not seem that interesting, especially for a Crusader (Thicket of Blade is not an Ironheart stance)
The bonuses gained can only be used against the opponent that generated them, and no other (it's a minor restriction, but worth keeping in mind)
An AoO is likely to do much more damage than 4, especially if using a two-handed weapon (even at level 1, we are looking at 1d10 + 6 ~= 11.5)


Thus, the two feats investment seems only worth it if one can generate more AoOs than one has available. In the recommendations I have seen, it is combined with Robilar's Gambit (-4 AR, 1 AoO per foe attack in melee) which itself requires Combat Reflexes. Dexterity is unlikely to be ignored (since it benefits Touch AC), and therefore we are looking at a minimum of 3 or 4 available AoOs per round...

Letting Combat Reflexes and Robilar's Gambit aside, is it really worth it investing in Ironheart Aura and Stormguard Warrior? Am I missing something?

(*) I have seen some debates where it is argued that refraining to take an AoO to fuel up Channel the Storm should use it up, which I ignore here. The feat is much worse in this case.
","Stormguard Warrior is an excellent feat – for building a character around

Stormguard Warrior can add huge amounts of attack and damage bonuses, but it requires that you be pretty dedicated towards generating attacks of opportunity to not take. Specifically, the feats Karmic StrikeCWar and Robilar’s GambitPHB2 are often used, because these feats allow you to take many more attacks of opportunity than you could otherwise (Karmic Strike allows you an AoO every time you’re hit, while Robilar’s Gambit allows you an AoO every time you’re attacked, whether they hit or not). Other ways of getting attacks of opportunity (defensive rebuke Devoted Spirit boostToB) or prevents others from avoiding them (thicket of blades stanceToB as mentioned, Mage Slayer featCArc) are also useful, but don’t add nearly as much as Karmic and/or Robilar’s.

But Ironheart Aura is pretty much a dead feat, yes, and without Karmic or Robilar’s, you’ll rarely see more than +4/+4 from Stormguard Warrior. +4/+4 for two feats isn’t entirely awful, of course; the Weapon Focus/Specialization line (which are awful) is four feats for +2/+4. If you have reach and thicket of blades, the +4/+4 seems pretty likely; using defensive rebuke can improve that dramatically. And it is pretty much expected that you’re using Power Attack with a big two-hander, so it’s really +0/+12. Basically, you’re trading extra attacks (attacks of opportunity) for more potent attacks in general (skip one AoO, get a full attack with +12 on each attack). So it’s not a terrible use of feats. Just not the highly-recommended one that it would be with Karmic and/or Robilar’s.

Also, note the Combat Rhythm option on Stormguard Warrior; it’s not nearly as explosive as Channel the Storm, but it is cool. Personally, I have always wanted to have that opportunity to combine it with avalanche of blades for hilarity. That’s not really an option for a crusader with a warblade dip, though.

The other thing to point out about Stormguard Warrior is that the Evasive Reflexes featToB uses the same “don’t take an AoO you could have, get something instead” mechanic, and like Stormguard Warrior, it doesn’t use up the AoO. You can use both Evasive Reflexes and Stormguard Warrior. This is particularly useful when you have thicket of blades – their 5-ft. steps provoke an AoO from you, which lets you 5-ft. step to keep up with them and gives you +4/+4. If that step was to try to get away from you so they could do something that provokes (say, cast a spell while you have Mage Slayer, or attack an ally after you hit them with defensive rebuke), you have either just prevented them from doing that, or are going to get pumped up even more.

3573,3573,5710,Harvesting parts from slain creatures,"In general: if you kill a monster with a body part that has some known (or suspected) property, is there any mechanic around harvesting the body part and using it as-is (or with minimal processing required)?

Specifically: We're fairly low level and just found ourselves fighting a Dretch. While none of us did very well on our knowledge checks, it became apparent during the fight that it had a fair number of buffs, including DR and elemental resistances.


Which of these are properties of the skin, and which are properties of the creature itself?
Would such properties persist in the skin after removal (and tanning, I assume)?
Would tanning/crafting produce armor, a wondrous item, a trophy, or what?


I read some comments about how his is sort of frowned upon since it disrupts the economics of the game... and, ultimately, I understand this is totally subject to DM's approval, but... just thought knowing how this is handled generally is appreciated.

",Patrick87,https://rpg.stackexchange.com/users/8737,"Yes, If it's a Dragon

The lone case I know of in the rules that talks about this is Dragonhide Armor. You use a dragon's scales to make it, and the armor can get properties from it. Here's the description (emphasis mine, as it's the relevant part):


  Armorsmiths can work with the hides of dragons to produce armor or
  shields of masterwork quality. One dragon produces enough hide for a
  single suit of masterwork hide armor for a creature one size category
  smaller than the dragon. By selecting only choice scales and bits of
  hide, an armorsmith can produce one suit of masterwork banded mail for
  a creature two sizes smaller, one suit of masterwork half-plate for a
  creature three sizes smaller, or one masterwork breastplate or suit of
  full plate for a creature four sizes smaller. In each case, enough
  hide is available to produce a light or heavy masterwork shield in
  addition to the armor, provided that the dragon is Large or larger. If
  the dragonhide comes from a dragon that had immunity to an energy
  type, the armor is also immune to that energy type, although this does
  not confer any protection to the wearer. If the armor or shield is
  later given the ability to protect the wearer against that energy
  type, the cost to add such protection is reduced by 25%.


That's about it.

Which of these are properties of the skin, and which are properties of the creature itself?

Properties are that of the creature as a whole. Skinning a Drow and wearing it does not confer it's Spell Resistance on you. Somehow capturing part of an Air Elemental and eating it doesn't let you turn into a Whirlwind (although it might give you an upset stomach). Etc.

The exception is Dragonhide, which is mentioned specifically in the rules.

Would such properties persist in the skin after removal (and tanning, I assume)?

Aside from Dragonhide, this is going to be DM interpretation. Does a Drow's right hand have Spell Resistance if severed? I really have no idea, and the rules don't say.

Would tanning/crafting produce armor, a wondrous item, a trophy, or what?

There's precedent for using hides to produce armor (Dragonhide, and ""Hide Armor"" in general). So if your DM rules that a bear hide has some special property, you could use it to get armor crafted, sure. But that requires such a ruling to work, by RAW the only time it works for armor is Dragonhide. You would also still have to have someone use the hide to make the armor with Craft: Armor.

Wondrous Items by the rules can only be produced with the Craft Wondrous Item feat. You could use whatever you skinned as the base of that item, but you'd still have to use the feat and pay the appropriate costs to make it magical.

As for a trophy... I don't see any reason why Craft: Taxidermy (or Profession: Taxidermist if your DM prefers) couldn't be used to make trophies. And hey, they look awesome on the wall of your base of operations. :)

There are a few cases (as Eric B mentioned) where an item might have a listed value. In that case, you could harvest the item and sell it. If it doesn't have a listed value, it's worthless unless your DM decides otherwise. (Maybe the leatherworkers in the area really like working with Dire Wolf pelts and will pay for them.)

Your design brief contains two completely incompatible requirements; powered from the signal, and small size. To get significant power from the signal, you need to collect significant signal; and that means a large antenna. 

The classic AM band ""crystal set"" circuitry you are studying needs about a hundred foot wire antenna to collect enough power to run sensitive headphones. At which point you might as well run the wire to the transmitter!

At higher frequencies you can reduce the antenna size to some extent but if you need the antenna to be small you MUST expect the received power to be very low, and need amplification.

Even your transistor switch is an amplifier, so admit it; there will be amplification. Then focus on the least power you need to power that amplifier - off the battery. One way might be to use a very low power micro like the MSP430 (under 1 microamp in the right usage pattern) to turn the receiver on very briefly every few seconds, to see if a signal is being transmitted.

4533,4533,7184,How to increase difficulty in Dungeon World,"I've been GMing for a couple of sessions now and I'm still struggling at making encounters or situations more difficult. I will describe dangerous situations and encounters in fiction but the mechanics make it too easy for my players to succeed.

For instance no matter how big I describe the Troll, if the fighter of the party charges him and swing his sword, roll+2 for Hack and slash, he'll easily hit the troll. Almost 40% chance to hit without consequences.
",MrJinPengyou,https://rpg.stackexchange.com/users/4000,"Dungeon World puts difficult after the roll, not before.

There are two misunderstandings combining when someone wants to start fiddling with the mechanics to make Dungeon World harder (or easier).

These two assumptions that are true in many other games are false in Dungeon World:


The roll is to determine success or failure.
Mechanical difficulty is assigned ahead of the roll based on the situation.


In another game, you might do this:


  DM: ""Jumping the chasm is a Hard check. Roll to see if you succeed.""
  
  
  Success: ""You leap the chasm and land safely on the other side.""
  Failure: ""You fall!"" (rolling) ""You suffer 23 damage from the fall. You're lying in a shallow stream at the bottom of the chasm.""
  


This is not how Dungeon World works.

In Dungeon World, the corresponding truths are:


The roll is to determine whether the GM gets to make a move as well.
Difficulty is determined after the roll, but only by the GM's choice of narration.


In Dungeon World, what happens is more like this:


  DM: ""Jumping the chasm is dangerous, how are you going to defy that danger?""
  Paladin: ""I'm going to take a running start and put my all my strength into it.""
  DM: ""That sounds like Defying Danger by Powering Through, roll plus strength.""
  
  
  Hit: ""You leap the chasm and land safely on the other side.""
  (no GM move)
  Partial hit: ""You go to leap the chasm and then pull up short. You can feel that you're just not going to make it with your panoply of plate. You can remove your amour and leave it on this side and make the leap no problem. What do you do?""
  (executing the 7&ndash;9 result of Defy Danger: the PC hesitates and the GM offers an ugly choice)
  Miss: ""You leap the chasm, but only just. You slam into the far edge and barely manage to grab on to stop yourself from plummeting. Ranger, you can tell that Paladin is stuck, unable to pull herself up due to the weight of her plate armour. She's slipping, what do you do?""
  (GM move: put someone in a spot, along with the advice to move the spotlight around)
  


Let's unpack that.

First, there is no success or failure, just hits and misses. Both hits and misses need to be translated through the rules and some more choices first, before you can judge subjectively whether the outcome was a success or a failure.

Hits of either kind always become fundamentally successes, but only after you follow the move's rules, and we don't know about misses until the GM makes their move. The success of a partial hit can carry consequences that can hurt enough that it's still a success, but a Pyrrhic one. We always follow the rules of the moves to find out what happens exactly first, we don't just say ""yay, you did what you were trying to.""

For misses, we need another step of transmutation before we learn about success or failure: the GM move. Most GM moves are some kind of consequence that is tangential to what the PC was trying for: losing things, getting split up, being caught in a bad spot, noticing a temptation, etc. None of those moves say ""you fail"", so when the GM makes those moves, she can say that you succeeded at your main intent anyway. The only time the GM has to say you failed at your intent is when she picks a GM move that has in-game effects incompatible with whatever the PC was attempting to achieve. If the GM is making a soft move, succeeding at the original task is one of the ways of making a GM move softer. If the GM is making a hard move, then failure is likely part of the package. Success and failure, then, depend on what the in-game effect of the GM's move is. The miss isn't the failure, it's the consequences of the move the GM chooses.

Second, mechanical difficulty isn't determined before the roll. Instead, the situation has already been set up using soft (or sometimes hard) GM moves in response to the players declared what they're doing, saying, and looking at, and whatever else is happening at the same time. That sets the in-game difficulty of the situation, but the difficulty only gets applied to the task at hand after the roll, and only on a miss or if the move's rules says the GM gets to add something unfortunate. On a success, the difficulty simply didn't matter.

Defy Danger seems like an exception to this because it often happens before other moves, but it's not. The GM can't just call for Defy Danger on a whim, it has to be because the PC is doing something that puts them in danger&mdash;so it triggers independently of the GM's wishes, based on the fair judgement of the situation instead, just like every other move. It's the choice to do something that exposes them to danger that increases the difficulty, not the GM deciding it should be harder and assigning a mechanical modifier.

When a player declares their PC is attempting something that matches a move without exposing themself to danger first, the group just does what the move says. There is no difficulty involved at first. The roll is made, and a hit means they did what they were trying to do, easy as pie. Only when the roll gives the GM an opportunity to make a move, or to say something as part of the move's instructions, does the GM bring difficulty into the picture after the fact. If the roll ""should"" have been harder in some other system, now is the time to show just how hard it was by using a hard move to show the hard consequences of the risks taken. If the roll ""should"" have been easy, now is the time to show that it was easy by making a soft, kind move that might even include success, despite the miss.

A quick example might help demonstrate the difference: Imagine the Fighter is Hack &amp; Slashing against an orc, and misses. The GM chooses a move that follows (a GM principle), choosing to have the Fighter slip and go to one knee as the orc grins and winds up for a strong overhand chop (soft move: show signs). Now imagine the Fighter is Hack &amp; Slashing against a roper (a toothy tentacle monster), and misses. The GM chooses a move that follows, choosing to have the Fighter grabbed and pinned by three wrapping tentacles (hard move: put them in a spot). That's much worse! Fighting the roper is harder than fighting an orc, but it's harder because it's more dangerous when the Fighter messes up, not because of plusses or minuses.

This actually goes for hits too: even when you roll a hit, what you were trying to do... maybe that actually makes your life harder, and you did that all by yourself without the GM's help. Again, it's the situation caused by the result of the chain of moves that makes things harder or easier after the roll. That's not something that could be modelled by a bonus or penalty to the roll anyway, but it neatly flows from the non-bonus-based difficulty rules of Dungeon World.

After quite some research I still did not find a satisfying solution for OpenElec but had enough info to come up with one that is very simple and really works with high quality and only about ~1sec delay!

You need:


VLC Media Player (I used v2.1.3 Rincewind on my Win7 x64)
A soundcard that provides a ""Stereo Mix"" recording device (I
was fortunate enough to have one on-board)
A Raspberry Pi (I use OpenElec 4.0.5, although it should work for XBMC in general)


Note: If you do not have a soundcard that supports this you could try to use VAC (http://www.virtualaudiocable.net/), although I am tellin' you it did not work properly for me, poor audio quality and buffer problems all the way...but maybe it's just me.

Step 1)

Create a batch file which starts a VLC http streaming service in background and captures audio from the ""Stereo Mix"" recording device:

Notes:


You might have to change the recording device if yours has a different name, I used Audacity (http://audacity.sourceforge.net/) to check the names of my capture devices since I already had it installed
Yes, the audio bitrate is very high (maximum for Vorbis), but the higher the bitrate the quicker the buffer is filled and hence the shorter the delay :-) (you cannot change the buffer size explicity for music on XBMC, I use 5MB buffer on mine in general)
I tried FLAC, MP3 and even WAV and apart from the fact that only MP3 and Vorbis worked at all with my Pi, I had the quickest loading time on the Pi (basically instantly) and the least delay with Vorbis


Step 2)

Navigate to 


  \\rapsberrypi\Userdata\playlists\music


and create a .strm file with a name of your choice there (I called mine VLC.strm) which contains the plain link to your VLC stream: (change IP to IP of your PC :p)

Step 3)

You can now either set the audio device which is captured by ""Stereo Mix"" to default in the windows sound settings or open a player like VLC and manually use the non-default device to play music on your RaspberryPi:

Open your VLC (in addition to the one minimized in your tray which is streaming your ""Stereo Mix"") and perform the following steps:


Tools -> Preferences
Audio
Output module: ""WaveOut audio output""
Device: - your (analog) device which is captured by the ""Stereo Mix"" recording device-
Save
Restart VLC
Play Music


Step 4)

On your RaspberryPi:


In XBMC navigate to Music -> Playlists
Select VLC.strm (or whatever you called it)
ENJOY MUSIC!

Basically, I want my Raspberry Pi to be connected to my stereo and then play any audio output from my computer via wifi to the PI.

Is there any way to do this easily, without having to use special players? I.e. Is there anyway for the PC to just recognise the Pi as ""speakers""?'

I would like to hear every sound on my PC on the stereo, ie. Gaming, music, system sounds, notifications, youtube videos etc.

Thanks very much!
","Wanted to do this myself from Windows7 -> RaspberryPi (OpenElec) and stumbled over your question.
After quite some research I still did not find a satisfying solution for OpenElec but had enough info to come up with one that is very simple and really works with high quality and only about ~1sec delay!

You need:


VLC Media Player (I used v2.1.3 Rincewind on my Win7 x64)
A soundcard that provides a ""Stereo Mix"" recording device (I
was fortunate enough to have one on-board)
A Raspberry Pi (I use OpenElec 4.0.5, although it should work for XBMC in general)


Note: If you do not have a soundcard that supports this you could try to use VAC (http://www.virtualaudiocable.net/), although I am tellin' you it did not work properly for me, poor audio quality and buffer problems all the way...but maybe it's just me.

Step 1)

Create a batch file which starts a VLC http streaming service in background and captures audio from the ""Stereo Mix"" recording device:

@echo off

set vlc=""C:\Program Files (x86)\VideoLAN\VLC\vlc.exe""
start """" %vlc% --qt-start-minimized dshow:// :dshow-vdev=none :dshow-adev=""Stereo Mix (Realtek High Defini"" :live-caching=10 :sout=#transcode{vcodec=none,acodec=vorb,ab=500,channels=2,samplerate=44100}:http{dst=:8080/audiostream.ogg} :sout-keep

3456,3456,5506,What is the difference between different types of disc brake pads,"I've seen several different descriptors for disc brake pads: Metallic, Semi-Metallic, and Organic.  What is the difference between these types of disc brake pads?
",Benzo,https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/users/2997,"Youll run into two types of metallic pads- sintered metallic and semi-metallic. The term ""metallic"" without any modifier gets used for a couple of reasons- a) many manufacturers don't offer both varieties of metallic pads for a given brake, so the type is implicit, and b) lots of folks don't know the difference or think the terms are interchangeable. They are similar, but different:

Sintered metallic pads offer the best stopping power, but also cause the most rotor wear and can make the most noise, especially when wet. They are also the least affected by adverse conditions. Sintered metallic are typically used in downhill/freeride applications, but can be used for less demanding riding types as well. Depending on the setup, sintered pads can feel ""grabby"", that is, that they lack modulation at the lever. That problem tends to arise on more powerful brakes with larger rotors though, and both of those factors play towards that perception.

Semi-metallics are a tradeoff between braking performance and pad wear/noise. They still stop very well but can be a little less noisy and cause a little less rotor wear. They may also offer better lever modulation than sintered metallic pads. This pad type can often be found on higher end all-mountain, trail, and cross country oriented brakes, though some manufacturers opt for sintered pads while others may opt for organics.

Organic pads are the kindest to your rotors and typically quitest, but don't offer the same bite as metallic pads. These pads also wear the quickest. This does not mean that they're low end pads though, and depending on conditions, riding style and personal preference they may be a great choice.

839,839,1335,Parse order and/or single/double quote issue with Calendar events and Google Map Info Window,"I am utilizing a combination of Solspace 'Calendar', 'Playa', and 'Google Maps for ExpressionEngine'. I'm having a strange issue where the dates aren't showing up correctly in my infowindows on the Google Map, but they show up fine using the same code outside of the infowindow.

So, I have a 'Location' channel, and an 'Event' channel. The Event channel is associated with the Calendar module, and uses a Playa single relationship field to relate it to a Location.

I am adding markers to the map for every 'Location', and for each marker, I'm populating the infowindow with the Location details. this includes using the Playa:Parents method to show all of the events that are at that location. 

I copied the code from the Solspace Calendar demo template for a single event to show the event date, because it had all the conditionals all worked out to deal with single day or multi-day events well. 

My problem is that in the infowindow, it's only showing the 'From' date, and not the 'To' part of the date string. It shows it correctly when I output it outside of the map, though. Here is the code that is outputting the date information. 

    {exp:calendar:events}
    &lt;b&gt;From:&lt;/b&gt; {event_first_date format=""%F %j, %Y at %g:%i%a""}
    {if event_never_ends}
        (never ends)
    {if:else}
        {if ""{event_first_date format='%Y%m%d%g%i%a'}"" != ""{event_last_date format='%Y%m%d%g%i%a'}""} &lt;b&gt;to:&lt;/b&gt;
            {if ""{event_first_date format=""%Y%m%d""}"" != ""{event_last_date format=""%Y%m%d""}""}
                {event_last_date format=""%l, %F %j, %Y at %g:%i%a""}
            {if:else}
                {event_last_date format=""%g:%i%a""}
            {/if}
        {/if}
    {/if}
    &lt;a href=""{path=find-music/event/{url_title}}""&gt;{title}&lt;/a&gt;
{/exp:calendar:events}


But this is how it outputs, in the infowindow, and outside of the map.

(crap, I don't have enough 'reputation' to post the image here, but it's here: http://paleosun.com/misc/stackexchange-map-calendar-question.jpg)

Notice, the section below the map has the ""to"" date. Same code is used to output it.

I have determined that something is going wrong with the quotes in the event date formatting tags. The {if ""{event_first_date format='%Y%m%d%g%i%a'}"" != ""{event_last_date format='%Y%m%d%g%i%a'}""} part is never resolving to 'true' like it should. In fact, If I just try to output {event_first_date format='%Y%m%d%g%i%a'} in the infowindow part, nothing show up. However, if I use double quotes and output {event_first_date format=""%Y%m%d%g%i%a""} it DOES work. The problem is, I cannot use that fix in the conditional, because double quotes are already being used around the output of that tag...

Any ideas why? Or what I can do as a work-around?

I'm having a strange issue where the dates aren't showing up correctly in my infowindows on the Google Map, but they show up fine using the same code outside of the infowindow.

So, I have a 'Location' channel, and an 'Event' channel. The Event channel is associated with the Calendar module, and uses a Playa single relationship field to relate it to a Location.

I am adding markers to the map for every 'Location', and for each marker, I'm populating the infowindow with the Location details. this includes using the Playa:Parents method to show all of the events that are at that location. 

I copied the code from the Solspace Calendar demo template for a single event to show the event date, because it had all the conditionals all worked out to deal with single day or multi-day events well. 

My problem is that in the infowindow, it's only showing the 'From' date, and not the 'To' part of the date string. It shows it correctly when I output it outside of the map, though. Here is the code that is outputting the date information. 

    {exp:calendar:events}
    &lt;b&gt;From:&lt;/b&gt; {event_first_date format=""%F %j, %Y at %g:%i%a""}
    {if event_never_ends}
        (never ends)
    {if:else}
        {if ""{event_first_date format='%Y%m%d%g%i%a'}"" != ""{event_last_date format='%Y%m%d%g%i%a'}""} &lt;b&gt;to:&lt;/b&gt;
            {if ""{event_first_date format=""%Y%m%d""}"" != ""{event_last_date format=""%Y%m%d""}""}
                {event_last_date format=""%l, %F %j, %Y at %g:%i%a""}
            {if:else}
                {event_last_date format=""%g:%i%a""}
            {/if}
        {/if}
    {/if}
    &lt;a href=""{path=find-music/event/{url_title}}""&gt;{title}&lt;/a&gt;
{/exp:calendar:events}


But this is how it outputs, in the infowindow, and outside of the map.

(crap, I don't have enough 'reputation' to post the image here, but it's here: http://paleosun.com/misc/stackexchange-map-calendar-question.jpg)

Notice, the section below the map has the ""to"" date. Same code is used to output it.

I have determined that something is going wrong with the quotes in the event date formatting tags. The {if ""{event_first_date format='%Y%m%d%g%i%a'}"" != ""{event_last_date format='%Y%m%d%g%i%a'}""} part is never resolving to 'true' like it should. In fact, If I just try to output {event_first_date format='%Y%m%d%g%i%a'} in the infowindow part, nothing show up. However, if I use double quotes and output {event_first_date format=""%Y%m%d%g%i%a""} it DOES work. The problem is, I cannot use that fix in the conditional, because double quotes are already being used around the output of that tag...

Any ideas why? Or what I can do as a work-around?

art


  early 13c., ""skill as a result of learning or practice,"" from O.Fr. art (10c.), from L. artem (nom. ars) ""work of art; practical skill; a business, craft,"" from PIE *ar-ti- (cf. Skt. rtih ""manner, mode;"" Gk. arti ""just,"" artios ""complete, suitable,"" artizein ""to prepare;"" L. artus ""joint;"" Armenian arnam ""make;"" Ger. art ""manner, mode""), from base *ar- ""fit together, join"" (see arm (1)). In M.E. usually with sense of ""skill in scholarship and learning"" (c.1300), especially in the seven sciences, or liberal arts. This sense remains in Bachelor of Arts, etc. Meaning ""human workmanship"" (as opposed to nature) is from late 14c. Sense of ""cunning and trickery"" first attested c.1600. Meaning ""skill in creative arts"" is first recorded 1610s; especially of painting, sculpture, etc., from 1660s. Broader sense of the word remains in artless.
  
  Fine arts, ""those which appeal to the mind and the imagination"" first recorded 1767. Expression art for art's sake (1836) translates Fr. l'art pour l'art. First record of art critic is from 1865. Arts and crafts ""decorative design and handcraft"" first attested in the Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society, founded in London, 1888.


Shows how the meanings evolved from a wider meaning into a more narrow one. In context of Bachelor of Arts, it is obvious that it refers to ""skill in scholarship and learning"". 

Today when we talk about artist and art the immediate association are paintings, sculptures and other ""works to be appreciated primarily for their beauty or emotional power"". 

However some connotations from older meanings still remain:


in the expression ""art of making something"" we don't refer to l'art pur l'art, but we refer to craftsmanship (an older meaning)   
in slightly metaphorical sense, ""art of..."" can be taken to mean skill, as in art of persuasion, art of motorcycle maintenance (wikipedia), art of war, rather then art that is normally exhibited in a gallery
in ""college of arts and sciences"", arts refer to ""studies intended to provide general knowledge and intellectual skills""
in artless, the 1st meaning lists: ""lacking art, knowledge, or skill"", extending the semantic to include knowledge and skills in what should be a direct antonym


Also, from wikipedia on the arts


  In the Middle Ages, Artes Liberales (liberal arts) taught in medieval universities as part of the Trivium: (grammar, rhetoric, and logic) and the Quadrivium (arithmetic, geometry, music, and astronomy), and the Artes Mechanicae (mechanical arts) such as metalworking, farming, cooking, business and the making of clothes or cloth. The modern distinctions between ""artistic"" and non-artistic skills did not develop until the Renaissance.


I think it is reasonable to assume that such usage as in the above influenced etymologies of many other terms and I think it is easy to justify, even today, usage that when talking about arts encompasses skill and craftsmanship.

As for capitalized the Art - you will find it referring to almost anything; for more colorful examples see magic, alchemy and so on.

Sounds like you may not have gotten an equivalent replacement.  When looking for a replacement transformer, you should be concerned with 


Input, or primary voltage
Output, or secondary voltage
Volt-amperes (VA) rating.


If the transformer is not designed to supply the amount of current needed by the components on the circuit, it will overheat and likely die. Current generates heat. The more current that flows through the transformers coil, the hotter those tiny wires get. Get the wires too hot, and they will break. Heating and cooling cycles of the transformer can cause the wires to become brittle, which can also lead to failure over time.

If you've recently added components to the system that draw power from the transformer (WiFi thermostat, electronic dampers, etc.), you may have to upgrade to a transformer with a higher VA rating. If you replaced an old transformer with a new one that had a lower VA rating, that could explain the overheating.

Short on transformer secondary

A short somewhere in the circuit on the secondary side of the transformer, could also lead to overheating.  Often times the secondary circuit has no overcurrent protection (fuse), so it can be easy to overload the circuit and not know until it's too late.

4422,4422,7025,Quantum Mechanical Meaning of Atomic Orbitals,"According to quantum mechanics, for multi-electron atoms, a single electron around the nuclei can be in the state of linear combination of different eigen energy states. In that case, even the energy of the electron is not one of the eigen energies.

In chemistry, we often say that an electron is in an orbital (such as 1s, 2s), another electron is in another orbital, etc. How does it make sense if an electron is in a linear combination state?
",NGY,https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/4314,"As John Rennie points out, the picture of an electron in an orbital breaks down in multielectron atoms because of electron correlations. However, you can still assign a ""fraction"" of an electron to an orbital by diagonalizing the reduced one-particle density matrix (1RDM) of the system. This matrix is Hermitian, positive semi-definite, has eigenvalues $n_i \leq 1$, and describes the total electronic density of the system as
\begin{equation}
\rho (r) = \sum \limits_i n_i \psi_i^*(r) \psi_i(r)
\end{equation}
where $\psi_i (r)$ are the orbitals. Thus, $n_i$ is the ""occupation number"" of orbital $\psi_i$ and describes how much on average an electron is in that orbital.

Now, with respect to your question:
""In chemistry, we often say that an electron is in an orbital (such as 1s, 2s), another electron is in another orbital, etc. How does it make sense if an electron is in a linear combination state?"" Well, it makes sense because often we find that there are $N_e$ (number of electrons) eigenvalues $n_i$ which are very close to one, while the rest of the eigenvalues are very small. The reason for this is that the exact wavefunction is an infinite sum of Slater determinants (i.e., an antisymetric function which describes one electron configuration) considering all possible configurations. However, because of the variational principle, configurations which are very high in energy contribute very little to the wavefunction and hence have small weights $n_i$.

There are cases in which the eigenvalues of the 1RDM differ significantly from one or zero. This occurs if there are different possible configurations that are similar in energy. For example, in transition metals, configurations involving 4s or 3d orbitals are very close in energy. This is the reason for which the configurations predicted by the aufbau principle break down for these elements.

The capacitor terminals are open; they are not connected to any finite valued impedance. Its capacity is \$C_1\$ and it has an initial voltage of \$V_1\$.

What happens to the capacitor voltage if we make the gap between the plates \$\ell_2=2\ell_1\$ without changing the amount of charge on the plates?



My thoughts on this:

Increasing the gap will decrease the capacitance.

$$ C_2 = \dfrac{C_1}{2} $$

Since the amount of charge is unchanged, the new capacitor voltage will be

$$ V_2 = \dfrac{Q}{C_2} = \dfrac{Q}{\dfrac{C_1}{2}} = 2\dfrac{Q}{C_1} = 2V_1. $$

Is this true? Can we change the capacitor voltage just by moving its plates? For example, suppose that I'm wearing plastic shoes and I have some amount of charge on my body. This will naturally cause a static voltage, since my body and the ground act as capacitor plates. Now, if I climb a perfect insulator building (e.g.; a dry tree), will the static voltage on my body increase?
",hkBattousai,https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/5542,"Yes, the voltage increases.  It seems most of us learned of this in school.  My Physics professor had a setup with movable plates, and a very sensitive (actually, very high impedance) voltmeter.  As the plates were pulled apart, the voltage went up.

This comes from the elemental formula Q=CV.  Pulling the plates apart lowers the capacitance.  The charge didn't go anywhere, so the voltage must rise.  This may seem counterintuitive, but the charge on the plates want to attract each other, and you are doing work by pulling them apart.

You can reproduce the experiment described above if you have a voltmeter with an FET input (or an oscilloscope, if you're that fortunate).  Ground the negative lead and hold the other lead in your hand.  If your shoes are not conductive, and you don't have any ESD straps connected, you should be able to deflect the meter simply by raising and lowering your foot.  By the way, rubbing the carpet creates the charge and picking up your feet and moving away is what raises those static charges to such high voltage levels.

On a practical note, this is how an electret condenser microphone works.   As the diaphragm vibrates, the capacitance between it and a fixed plate changes, and the voltage changes with it.

Ground the negative lead and hold the other lead in your hand.  If your shoes are not conductive, and you don't have any ESD straps connected, you should be able to deflect the meter simply by raising and lowering your foot.  By the way, rubbing the carpet creates the charge and picking up your feet and moving away is what raises those static charges to such high voltage levels.

On a practical note, this is how an electret condenser microphone works.   As the diaphragm vibrates, the capacitance between it and a fixed plate changes, and the voltage changes with it.

3751,3751,5976,Applying OO patterns and principles to plugin development,"I'm busy writing my first plugin, using PHP 5.3.5. I come from a C# environment, and I must say I'm more than happy with the level of support for good, solid OOP techniques in PHP. However, I'm a little uncertain how to structure a plugin using classes. I have a plugin class that takes care of hook registration in its constructor, and some worker classes like a mail queue and mailer, but I have one or two non-class scripts, mostly for forms, that I don't quite know how to neatly fit into classes. What resources are their I can consult for guidance on this aspect of my OO plugin?

The plugin is for mass mailing, i.e. mailing to all subscribers, on schedule etc. It registers a custom post type for mail templates, with add new and edit capabilities, and it adds its own menu to the bottom of the admin menu, currently with two submenu pages: 'settings' and 'send mail'. It also adds an 'opt out' option to the user profile page, but that's quite tidy and easy to include the main plugin class.

2398,2398,3828,Do parallel realities take precedence over time travel in the Star Trek Universe?,"The 2009 Star Trek movie and its pending sequels are based on the concept of parallel realities introduced in the season 7 Next Generation episode ""Parallels,"" laying out that anything that could happen has happened in a parallel universe. The Enterprise and its crew from the most recent movie are part of a parallel reality that was created when Nero and Spock came back through the black hole created by red matter in an attempt to stem the destruction caused by a supernova. For clarification, this crew will be referred to as Chris Pine's and the older movies as Shatner's.

In the movie Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home, a probe shows up in 2286 at Earth looking for whales that had disappeared decades before. Shatner's crew is faced with travelling back in time to try and retrieve two humpback whales in order to stop the cylindrical probe from destroying Earth. They do this using a Klingon Bird-of-Prey that was stolen in the previous movie, going back to 1986 to find the whales.

I think it's safe to assume that in Pine's reality, the probe will probably make an appearance again, since the destruction of whales probably wouldn't change. So Pine's crew will also be faced with the dilemma of travelling back to find humpbacks (although probably without using a Klingon ship).

If Pine's crew also goes back to the same instant in 1986 as Shatner's crew to find whales (which seems highly improbable given that hitting the same time period as Shatner would be ridiculous), would they run into Shatner's crew or would it create another parallel reality stemming from 1986? If it created another reality, that seems like some kind of backwards causality since the event that would be causing the new stem wouldn't be the instant before the ships arrived but an event in the future. Would time travel trump the parallel universe and both Kirks would be there at the same time?
",SocioMatt,https://scifi.stackexchange.com/users/6244,"I'm not sure if this is actually a parallel reality or a new timeline. The difference between the two I must admit goes over my head right now. However there is two main differences in the Pine Line (I'm coining that phrase) one events have been changed drastically; technology is more advanced and with the destruction of Vulcan certain elements of stories will not play out the same. That being said you are right the Entity that speaks whale is most likely sure to return which brings me to the second point. Old Spock is there and knows all about this.

I can't find a date for the whales extinction but if they are still around I'm sure he will make a priority of saving them. If they are not he knows advanced technology and will be able to give ample warning to the Pine Line to prepare and maybe even bring back the whales from the past. After all the Earth was under attack last time which is why the Shatner Line was saved by the Enterprise crew who were on exile on the planet Vulcan which is no more.

One of the advantages of the Pine Line is that it actually gets to retell the story without dismissing the original fan loved series or movies.

The Enterprise and its crew from the most recent movie are part of a parallel reality that was created when Nero and Spock came back through the black hole created by red matter in an attempt to stem the destruction caused by a supernova. For clarification, this crew will be referred to as Chris Pine's and the older movies as Shatner's.

In the movie Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home, a probe shows up in 2286 at Earth looking for whales that had disappeared decades before. Shatner's crew is faced with travelling back in time to try and retrieve two humpback whales in order to stop the cylindrical probe from destroying Earth. They do this using a Klingon Bird-of-Prey that was stolen in the previous movie, going back to 1986 to find the whales.

I think it's safe to assume that in Pine's reality, the probe will probably make an appearance again, since the destruction of whales probably wouldn't change. So Pine's crew will also be faced with the dilemma of travelling back to find humpbacks (although probably without using a Klingon ship).

If Pine's crew also goes back to the same instant in 1986 as Shatner's crew to find whales (which seems highly improbable given that hitting the same time period as Shatner would be ridiculous), would they run into Shatner's crew or would it create another parallel reality stemming from 1986? If it created another reality, that seems like some kind of backwards causality since the event that would be causing the new stem wouldn't be the instant before the ships arrived but an event in the future. Would time travel trump the parallel universe and both Kirks would be there at the same time?
","I'm not sure if this is actually a parallel reality or a new timeline. The difference between the two I must admit goes over my head right now. However there is two main differences in the Pine Line (I'm coining that phrase) one events have been changed drastically; technology is more advanced and with the destruction of Vulcan certain elements of stories will not play out the same. That being said you are right the Entity that speaks whale is most likely sure to return which brings me to the second point. Old Spock is there and knows all about this.

I can't find a date for the whales extinction but if they are still around I'm sure he will make a priority of saving them. If they are not he knows advanced technology and will be able to give ample warning to the Pine Line to prepare and maybe even bring back the whales from the past. After all the Earth was under attack last time which is why the Shatner Line was saved by the Enterprise crew who were on exile on the planet Vulcan which is no more.

One of the advantages of the Pine Line is that it actually gets to retell the story without dismissing the original fan loved series or movies. However many things are changed and Nimoy Spock can be sort of a McGuffin used to fix or explain away serious consistences such as what will happen when the whales come.

  8 And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden in

  presence of the LORD God amongst the trees of the garden.
  
  9 And the LORD God called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where [art]

You can't play a hide-and-seek game with God (Hebrews 4:13) because He is omnipresent(Psalm 139:8). God demanded confession from Adam.

4719,4719,7487,Mechanical Equivalent of Heat,"Recently I have been looking up James Joule's experiment regarding the mechanical equivalent of heat.  After viewing some drawings of the apparatus, I assumed that the lines holding the weights would have to be attached to the drum.  They would then be allowed to fall completely through a certain distance until the lines were at full length and the mechanical motion of the fluid would have to be allowed to continue to flow, causing the weights to be pulled up a bit and drop again, oscillating up and down until the motion stopped and all of the mechanical energy from the weights would be transferred into the fluid.

However, upon watching some videos, (this video is about 14 minutes long; but, if you advance to about 5 min 30 sec, it will show the experiment in question.) I noticed that the weights were allowed to be stopped by a level surface (an external force) instead of doing what I have described above.  To me, this means the weights were still in motion and, therefore, still had KE that was not transferred into the fluid.  

Of course, the weights are moving very slowly, much more slowly than if they had been allowed to free-fall through the distance; so, their kinetic energy is very small compared to the potential energy they lost, meaning the vast majority of the potential energy was transferred into the fluid and into other, small energy losses.

Should I assume the speeds of the weights were small enough to ignore the KE in the weights?

The assumption seems to be that the potential energy lost by the falling weights was all transferred into the fluid.  However, in the experiments, the lines have to be wound back up and the weights dropped several times in order to make a measurable difference in temperature.  Each time the weights fall, they are stopped by an external force, meaning they have kinetic energy that is not transferred into the fluid after falling through a measured distance.  It seems to me that some of the potential energy from the weights is transferred into the fluid; but, some of it is transferred into the kinetic energy of the weights falling.

What can I do to solve this problem?
","Will you consider using XmlSerializer to deserialize your data? It works like you load the XML file into an object.

StreamReader sr = new StreamReader(xmlData);
XmlSerializer xs = new XmlSerializer(typeof(Flight));
Flights f = xs.Deserialize(sr) as Flight;


However, you may need some modification in your Flight type


You should use array instead of List&lt;>
Add attribute [XmlArray(""Name"")] and [XmlArrayItem(""Name"")] in your array type members.


For example

[XmlArray(""Itineraries"")]
[XmlArrayItem(""Itinerary"")]
public Itinerary[] Itinerary;

Genesis Chapter 3:


  8 And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden in
  the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the
  presence of the LORD God amongst the trees of the garden.
  
  9 And the LORD God called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where [art]

",jay_t55,https://christianity.stackexchange.com/users/4268,"God’s question: “where art thou” certainly proves that man’s position in relationship with God was altered from the original.  Hiding from God does not necessitate that man was physically hiding, but more likely a spiritual hiding.  We know that the ""death"" God warned against was not only physical death because Adam did not immediately die.  Nor was Adam or Eve surprised by this, so one could conclude that they understood “death” in a spiritual form of separation.  

We mustn’t confine the early Bible accounts to space in time.  Adam ""walked"" with God, this does not require that God took on physical form and strolled down a path with Adam.  It does however indicate that God and Adam walked in some form (Spiritual/Eternal) together.

4985,4985,7937,"How to find out the ""serviceability"" of a car?","One of my concerns before purchasing a car is how expensive repairs are going to be down the road. For example my car up until recently was a Volvo 850, and the air conditioner didn't work in it; the cost of getting it fixed was significantly higher than other cars because of the way the A/C unit is installed in the car, so I went on without air conditioning. Another example is the service light in the car - while the car had a standard OBD-II port which could read error messages, it required a special Volvo reader to reset the service light.

I know a lot of generalizations can be made about one make versus another, but those are obviously not allowed on this site (in fact, I hope this question is allowed at all...) - so that's not what I'm looking for. And I know there is a wide range of problems a car can encounter, and many of them are universal - replacing tires, for (a bad) example.

So, just like I can go to KBB and look up the recommended price of a car, is there someplace I can go to look up a make &amp; model of a car and see what proprietary, extra-expensive parts are in the car? Something that, for example, I could have put in the Volvo 850 and it would have told me about those above-mentioned peculiarities alongside undoubtedly a number of other proprietary bits that I didn't have problems with.
",Ricket,https://mechanics.stackexchange.com/users/698,"Your best basic resource for a question like this is an objective publication that specializes in collecting exactly this sort of information.  For example, Consumer Reports provides exactly this sort of information: be aware, it will cost money if you want full access to their website.  However, there's a good chance that they have the magazine at your local library.

There's also a meta level of knowledge to be gained by people who work on a particular brand of car regularly.  For example, reading what people have to say about modern Subarus was what drove me to buy the cars I have now.  Aside from the AWD, the fact that all Subarus are effectively the same fundamental design layout and engines wrapped in different bodies really appealed to me.

For example my car up until recently was a Volvo 850, and the air conditioner didn't work in it; the cost of getting it fixed was significantly higher than other cars because of the way the A/C unit is installed in the car, so I went on without air conditioning. Another example is the service light in the car - while the car had a standard OBD-II port which could read error messages, it required a special Volvo reader to reset the service light.

I know a lot of generalizations can be made about one make versus another, but those are obviously not allowed on this site (in fact, I hope this question is allowed at all...) - so that's not what I'm looking for. And I know there is a wide range of problems a car can encounter, and many of them are universal - replacing tires, for (a bad) example.

So, just like I can go to KBB and look up the recommended price of a car, is there someplace I can go to look up a make &amp; model of a car and see what proprietary, extra-expensive parts are in the car? Something that, for example, I could have put in the Volvo 850 and it would have told me about those above-mentioned peculiarities alongside undoubtedly a number of other proprietary bits that I didn't have problems with.
","Your best basic resource for a question like this is an objective publication that specializes in collecting exactly this sort of information.  For example, Consumer Reports provides exactly this sort of information: be aware, it will cost money if you want full access to their website.  However, there's a good chance that they have the magazine at your local library.

There's also a meta level of knowledge to be gained by people who work on a particular brand of car regularly.  For example, reading what people have to say about modern Subarus was what drove me to buy the cars I have now.  Aside from the AWD, the fact that all Subarus are effectively the same fundamental design layout and engines wrapped in different bodies really appealed to me.  I don't find myself hunting around for a particular component: they all look the same once you pop the hood.

So, if your mechanic friend loves working on a particular type of vehicle, that's generally a good sign.  If they are always cursing about the special code reader that they can only use on a particular model year, perhaps that's an ""avoid"" signal.

296,296,477,What are the benefits of owning a physical book?,"I have seen this question about updates of the D&amp;D 4th Edition books, and it got me thinking.
Since I got my Kindle I have not read a single paper novel; they have fewer drawbacks compared to digital copies than rpg rulebooks.


Dead-tree types have some benefits like looking good on a bookshelf, but any ebook reader weighs less with 100 novels than the usual hard-cover book. 
If you want to look for the damage of Ares Alpha, even with a half-decent tablet it takes less than 2 seconds.  
Digital copies do not get worn, they never get unwanted earmarks, but you can bookmark them.
Rulebooks do get updates, and unless you are willing to take a pen to your book, your hard copies will never contain them. The pdfs can be edited and resent to the buyers. 
Even better is the WotC approach with the DDI, you can look up any monster or item or (almost any) rule, in the most recent form, for 3 years at the cost of seven books. 


I think this is the way to go, even considering the horribly slow character builder. Although I must admit good illustration can help build the athmosphere.

So what am I missing? Why are people buying rpg rulebooks in paper format? Why are books even published, I do not need to know if feats are supposed to be on the right page and skills on the left, I just want a list of them, filterable any way I want. 

Is this just a necessary part of earning money? I understand that pdfs are copied illegally, but the Compendium is not. 
",András,https://rpg.stackexchange.com/users/9552,"I own an ebook, and I find it more comfortable linear reading than in physical books. Also, it's very handy when looking for exact words.

But I find flipping the pages looking for something that is not bookmarked or you don't know exactly where it is, (and you don't know what words look for) or doing diagonal reading on several pages much easier in physical books.

One thing that it's not very important to me, but it is to a lot of people is the aesthetic and emotional factors. A good physical book is something pretty that you can have and manipulate on your hands and that looks well on your bookshelf. Also, in time you can be emotionally attached to your manuals (especially if you own only a handful), but is rarer to feel the same to a digital file.

If you are going to support a stack with no capacity, I don't know why you need to allocate memory at all. You could simply have the pointer as NULL.
Using cout for error handling is not appropriate. You could either give ""undefined behaviour"" however may I suggest you throw an exception. You can handle your exceptions and use cout in your exception handler.
Implement a deep copy constructor and implement swap(). Then implement assignment in terms of both of these. To swap you would do:

void MyStaticIntStack::swap( MyStaticIntStack &amp; other )
{
    // swap each member
}



If you don't like using std::swap, write your own. I am not sure you have to avoid all STL, you probably cannot use STL containers for this because the exercise is to write your own container, but utilities like swap may be permitted (plus you can throw std exceptions).

I don't see why -1 shouldn't be a valid number in your stack. If someone does not know whether your stack is empty and tries a peek() from code, they would get -1 (plus some cout that they cannot handle). Perhaps have a method

bool empty() const;


which tells you if the stack is empty or not. You could also have size() and capacity() access methods.

You might want to be able to resize the capacity of your stack. If you find that difficult, have a private constructor that takes a new capacity plus a reference to an existing stack. That constructor can create the data with the relevant size and copy the data into it.

Your internal method would call this constructor to create a new bigger capacity stack, then invoke the swap() method. The temporary one would now disappear. (Do not create it with new).

On a style issue:


Initialize your members in the constructor initialization list, not the body of your constructor.
Do not use this-&gt; all over the code.

        //}
    }


If I change it to list1.remove(2); or list1.remove(0); then also its working fine. 

Note: This is sample code and I know it will work fine using Iterator. My sole purpose of this question is to know how method remove() works perfectly if condition is un-commented no matter what index you are removing from the list.
",Braj,https://stackoverflow.com/users/3218114,"The list has a variable called modCount. Whenever you call remove (or perform other structural modifications), it increments the modCount.

At the start of iteration, the iterator makes a note of the modCount, saving it as expectedModCount. When each item is read from the iterator, the iterator checks if the modCount equals the expected value, and throws an exception if it doesn't.

Usually, this will successfully cause the exception to be thrown if the list is unsafely modified during iteration. However, it's not sufficient in this case when the if statement is enabled. After your code has read ""World"", that item is removed, and so the list now contains [""Hello"", Good Evening""]. The iterator is still at position 1 (which now contains ""Good Evening"") and when it tries to read the next item, it finds it has now reached the end of the list, so it doesn't bother to check the modCount. Hence, no exception.

Note the caveat in the ConcurrentModificationException documentation: ""It is, generally speaking, impossible to make any hard guarantees in the presence of unsynchronized concurrent modification. Fail-fast operations throw ConcurrentModificationException on a best-effort basis.""

The code is still wrong though, even if it doesn't happen to throw the exception in this case. To remove an element while iterating, you must use the iterator's own remove method:

for (Iterator&lt;String&gt; it = list1.iterator(); it.hasNext();) {
    String s = it.next();
    if (s.equals(""World"")) {
        it.remove();

That way, the iterator knows that the list has changed and can still iterate correctly.

(I asked another question about repurposing magic items which is somewhat similar to this, but I don't think this is a duplicate, since this is specifically about harvesting nearly-ready-to-use parts of creatures, whereas the other one dealt mainly with using magic items to create new items).
",Patrick87,https://rpg.stackexchange.com/users/8737,"Pathfinder, like its predecessor D&amp;D 3.5, follows careful guidelines regarding the amount of treasure awarded and the value of items with magical properties.

That means while it's up to you as DM to decide what monster body parts are worth and what items can be crafted from them, be aware that you're effectively giving out treasure.


While there are no official rules, it stands to reason that the corpse has the creature's physical properties. A red dragon's hide is still tough and fire resistant even after separated from the dragon. However, magical properties (like a displacer beast's displacement) might degrade over time unless fixed in place with enchantment.
A house rule in our 3.5 games is that the item itself may have some properties of the creature, but the item does not confer these abilities to its wielder. For example, a red dragonhide shield won't protect you from a fireball, but the next adventurer to stumble upon your charred remains will find the shield undamaged. In fact, this rule made its way into Pathfinder's rules on dragonhide armour. While the armour doesn't confer energy resistance, the price to add the energy resistance enchantment is reduced by 25%.
You can craft weapons, armour, trophies and other items from slain creatures. Here's what I suggest:


Weapons/armour: You're essentially just crafting a normal item using the creature's corpse as special materials. Make craft checks as normal, but you don't pay the raw material cost. The GM decides what special properties the material has, if any, what items can be made, and what those items cost (for the purpose of craft duration and sale price). Properties shouldn't normally be as powerful as a permanent magic enhancement (but if they are, the GM should be aware of the treasure value he's awarding every time he uses that creature).
Wondrous items: Mundane crafting isn't enough to create a permanent magic item. You need rituals to fix the magic property in place. At best, a creature's body provides a discount of up to 25% on crafting an item: e.g. a displacer beast hide to make a cloak of displacement.
Spell components: 250gp for powdered horn sounds like a great way to get rich. However, that's the buy price, so you'd sell it at 125gp, and that's after processing: as per the craft skill, raw materials are only worth 1/3 of the finished item. So at best, body parts harvested for spell components are worth a fraction of the part's price.
Trinkets: Preserved monster hearts, heads on plaques and so forth should only be worth a few gp at most. Use the craft skill as a guideline. You can normally make half your craft check per week in gold as a profession anyway, so this isn't out of bounds.



If your players try to carry back every animal part for gold, this will lead to a lot of boring bean-counting and extra gold. Remind players that their carrying capacity is limited and body parts weigh a lot. Have the market saturate and suddenly nobody wants to buy all these grell beaks. Or abstract it away: say ""you sell all the collected monster parts for 50gp"", or you can craft as a profession for double value for two weeks after you have been on an adventure where you collected parts.

(I asked another question about repurposing magic items which is somewhat similar to this, but I don't think this is a duplicate, since this is specifically about harvesting nearly-ready-to-use parts of creatures, whereas the other one dealt mainly with using magic items to create new items).
","Pathfinder, like its predecessor D&amp;D 3.5, follows careful guidelines regarding the amount of treasure awarded and the value of items with magical properties.

That means while it's up to you as DM to decide what monster body parts are worth and what items can be crafted from them, be aware that you're effectively giving out treasure.


While there are no official rules, it stands to reason that the corpse has the creature's physical properties. A red dragon's hide is still tough and fire resistant even after separated from the dragon. However, magical properties (like a displacer beast's displacement) might degrade over time unless fixed in place with enchantment.
A house rule in our 3.5 games is that the item itself may have some properties of the creature, but the item does not confer these abilities to its wielder. For example, a red dragonhide shield won't protect you from a fireball, but the next adventurer to stumble upon your charred remains will find the shield undamaged. In fact, this rule made its way into Pathfinder's rules on dragonhide armour. While the armour doesn't confer energy resistance, the price to add the energy resistance enchantment is reduced by 25%.
You can craft weapons, armour, trophies and other items from slain creatures. Here's what I suggest:


Weapons/armour: You're essentially just crafting a normal item using the creature's corpse as special materials. Make craft checks as normal, but you don't pay the raw material cost. The GM decides what special properties the material has, if any, what items can be made, and what those items cost (for the purpose of craft duration and sale price). Properties shouldn't normally be as powerful as a permanent magic enhancement (but if they are, the GM should be aware of the treasure value he's awarding every time he uses that creature).
Wondrous items: Mundane crafting isn't enough to create a permanent magic item. You need rituals to fix the magic property in place. At best, a creature's body provides a discount of up to 25% on crafting an item: e.g. a displacer beast hide to make a cloak of displacement.
Spell components: 250gp for powdered horn sounds like a great way to get rich. However, that's the buy price, so you'd sell it at 125gp, and that's after processing: as per the craft skill, raw materials are only worth 1/3 of the finished item. So at best, body parts harvested for spell components are worth a fraction of the part's price.
Trinkets: Preserved monster hearts, heads on plaques and so forth should only be worth a few gp at most. Use the craft skill as a guideline. You can normally make half your craft check per week in gold as a profession anyway, so this isn't out of bounds.



If your players try to carry back every animal part for gold, this will lead to a lot of boring bean-counting and extra gold. Remind players that their carrying capacity is limited and body parts weigh a lot. Have the market saturate and suddenly nobody wants to buy all these grell beaks. Or abstract it away: say ""you sell all the collected monster parts for 50gp"", or you can craft as a profession for double value for two weeks after you have been on an adventure where you collected parts.

","Perhaps my question wasn't asked very well because I didn't get any help. But I finally figured it out!

This is the line of code that was causing the problems:

&lt;%= image_tag question.image_url(:thumb).to_s if question.image? %&gt;


This is the line of code that worked:

&lt;%= image_tag f.object.image_url(:thumb) %&gt;


I'm not totally clear, but it appears that I was in my questions partial and calling a method called question and rails didn't know what I meant.

I found the answer in this stackoverflow QA: Rails Nested Forms With Images

Now I've got a working if statement so my users can change the image:

&lt;% if f.object.image? %&gt;
  &lt;%= image_tag f.object.image_url(:thumb) %&gt;
  &lt;%= f.file_field :image %&gt;
&lt;% else %&gt;
  &lt;%= f.file_field :image %&gt;
  &lt;%= f.hidden_field :image_cache %&gt;
&lt;% end %&gt;


Next I have to figure out how to change the value on the file_field button.

4501,4501,7136,conditional probability - 2 different tests done,"Question:

A medical research team wanted to evaluate a screening method proposed for 
Alzheimer's disease. The method was evaluated on 450 patients randomly selected 
patients with Alzheimers (in 436 cases, the screening was positive). Moreover,
the method was also done on 500 patients without the disease and returned 
positive for 5 out of the 500. 7.7% of all Canadians over the age of 65 have
Alzhiemers. Find the probability that a Canadian over the age of 65 has Alzhiemers
given the test was positive.




It seems that the test returns a 96.8% chance of success given that the patient has alzhiemers and a .01% chance of success given the patient DOESN'T have alzhiemers. 

So I used bayes theorem for this one, so that I would find

  A = Alzhiemers
  Positive = Positive test result given the patient actually had alzhiemers 
  Positive2 = Positive test result given the patient doesn't have alzhiemers


$$P(A | Positive) = \frac{P(Positive|A)(A)}{P(Positive|A)(A) + P(Positive2|A)(A)}$$

$$= \frac{(.968)(.077)}{(.968)(.077) + (.01)(.077)}$$

$$= approx. .98$$

Did i do this correctly? As in was i supposed to even use bayes theorem for this problem?



ahh seems like i multiplied the probability of positive test result given the person doesn't have alzhiemers with the probability of all canadians who do have alzheimers. Thanks guys.

I'm writing a simple bash script that starts and stops Jetty. When I execute it, the script immediately puts my cursor back on the bash prompt. However, as Jetty starts up and writes its initialization output back to stdout, it leaves the cursor on a line of its own (without a prompt) until I enter a command or hit enter. Nitpicking, I know, but I figure there's an easy way to avoid this that I'm missing.

Here's the script:

My background

I'm studying for my master degree in mathematics. I have always (since I was 14) wanted to do my own research one day. As I grew older, I knew that mathematics was what I wanted to do. So I went to the university to study mathematics. After having encountered a course in group theory I knew that I belonged to the algebraic part of mathematics. I did my bachelor project in group theory and when I became a graduate student (September 2013), I took courses and made a project supporting my interest in algebra.

Along the way I created the vision that I would finish my master degree as a dedicated student in algebra. In order to realize this vision my plan was to study abroad for one semester taking new algebraic courses.

The situation

My situation today is that my study abroad semester begins tomorrow. As mentioned my dream is to do my own research, but more generally/important: I want to develop new ideas and be dedicated to something and I would love to follow/explore my passion.

My first thought (as many other students): I should get a PhD. So I did some research and figured out that there was an available position at the university I'm currently studying at in geometric group theory.

I don't know much about geometric group theory, but I do know that I love group theory. So I would really like to know if this is an opportunity or if I should just forget it.

Further remarks

I'm a student from Denmark and I'm studying abroad in Austria for one semester. After my study abroad semester I still have to study one year for my master degree in Denmark. However this year consists of a half year with elective courses and a half year where I'm making my master's thesis. 

I don’t know much about the PhD position. I found it from a Google search (: “PhD position group theory”). There is only given a starting date and an e-mail address for contact. I’m going to attend a course held by the supervisor of the project, so the whole thing is a coincidence. 

I have investigated my opportunities for a position at my home university. One of my supervisors, a professor in group theory, told me that he couldn't offer me a position, since it was a question about money, but would like to recommend me. I don't think the university accepts PhD students without a master degree and the positions are without project descriptions.

However there is also another university (in Denmark) with a talent program where it is possible to get a PhD position without having a master degree. I contacted them and they told me I should apply after my study abroad semester (because I would have a stronger profile). But I don't know my chances.
",HelloProfile,https://academia.stackexchange.com/users/12557,"I'm having a lot of trouble nailing down your question.  After reading it several times, I think you mean that you have an opportunity to go on to study a PhD in geometric group theory at your current university.  (Is it specifically relevant that you are going abroad tomorrow?  How does this fit in with the rest?)  From this I am guessing that you are not in the US, because in the US one would not have a position in ""geometric group theory"" specifically; one would just apply to the entire math department.  It could be helpful to know what country you are studying in.

So I think you are really asking whether you should go on to do a PhD?  You say that your motivation is to do mathematical research: for that you essentially need a PhD, yes.  


  Along the way I created the vision that I would finish my master degree as a dedicated student in algebra.


Yes, okay, you're studying algebra.  I feel like I'm missing some nuance here: what's the ""vision""?


  As mentioned my dream is to do my own research, but more generally/important: I want to develop new ideas and be dedicated to something and I would love to follow/explore my passion.


Again, I feel like I'm missing a nuance.  Doing your own research means precisely to developing your new ideas and being dedicated to something.  Doesn't everyone want to ""follow/explore their passion""?  That comes off sounding mean, which is not my intent: rather, I feel like you're trying to say something here and I'm missing it.


  I don't know much about geometric group theory, but I do know that I love group theory. So I would really like to know if this is an opportunity or if I should just forget it.


It seems clear that a PhD in geometric group theory is an indeed an opportunity to do everything that you said you wanted to do...in geometric group theory, which is a subfield of the field that you say you like.  Whether you will like GGT specifically seems best answered by learning some and finding out.  If the PhD program is so specifically invested in GGT that if you find out you don't want to do GGT per se then you'll need to leave the program, then you should study GGT on your own / during your master's degree first in order to find out whether it's interesting enough to you to spend years of your life on.  (I think GGT is really interesting.  If I hadn't done arithmetic geometry, I think I would have had fun with it.  So I assure you that there is nothing wrong with that subsubfield of mathematics!)

One of my supervisors, a professor in group theory, told me that he couldn't offer me a position, since it was a question about money, but would like to recommend me. I don't think the university accepts PhD students without a master degree and the positions are without project descriptions.

However there is also another university (in Denmark) with a talent program where it is possible to get a PhD position without having a master degree. I contacted them and they told me I should apply after my study abroad semester (because I would have a stronger profile). But I don't know my chances.
","I'm having a lot of trouble nailing down your question.  After reading it several times, I think you mean that you have an opportunity to go on to study a PhD in geometric group theory at your current university.  (Is it specifically relevant that you are going abroad tomorrow?  How does this fit in with the rest?)  From this I am guessing that you are not in the US, because in the US one would not have a position in ""geometric group theory"" specifically; one would just apply to the entire math department.  It could be helpful to know what country you are studying in.

So I think you are really asking whether you should go on to do a PhD?  You say that your motivation is to do mathematical research: for that you essentially need a PhD, yes.  


  Along the way I created the vision that I would finish my master degree as a dedicated student in algebra.


Yes, okay, you're studying algebra.  I feel like I'm missing some nuance here: what's the ""vision""?


  As mentioned my dream is to do my own research, but more generally/important: I want to develop new ideas and be dedicated to something and I would love to follow/explore my passion.


Again, I feel like I'm missing a nuance.  Doing your own research means precisely to developing your new ideas and being dedicated to something.  Doesn't everyone want to ""follow/explore their passion""?  That comes off sounding mean, which is not my intent: rather, I feel like you're trying to say something here and I'm missing it.


  I don't know much about geometric group theory, but I do know that I love group theory. So I would really like to know if this is an opportunity or if I should just forget it.


It seems clear that a PhD in geometric group theory is an indeed an opportunity to do everything that you said you wanted to do...in geometric group theory, which is a subfield of the field that you say you like.  Whether you will like GGT specifically seems best answered by learning some and finding out.  If the PhD program is so specifically invested in GGT that if you find out you don't want to do GGT per se then you'll need to leave the program, then you should study GGT on your own / during your master's degree first in order to find out whether it's interesting enough to you to spend years of your life on.  (I think GGT is really interesting.  If I hadn't done arithmetic geometry, I think I would have had fun with it.  So I assure you that there is nothing wrong with that subsubfield of mathematics!)


  I don't want to pursue a PhD for anything in this world. I just want to stay focus on creating a meaningful work life around my passion.


Huh?  This time I don't understand at all.  Please elaborate/rephrase.

4561,4561,7229,Why does my switch need to be wired in this fashion?,"Today was my first foray into electronics since high school, in the form of some simple Raspberry Pi experiments. I managed to get a circuit working where a switch controlled an LED with a potentiometer to control the brightness of the LED.

However, I am confused by the wiring of the switch. Firstly, here's a photo of my amazing work:



NOTE: the black lead on the potentiometer is not connected to anything (hard to tell in the photo). Also, I realised afterwards that I could have just inserted the potentiometer into the breadboard rather than soldering wires to it. Noob mistake (one of many).

Here's an attempt at a schematic (also probably wrong because I don't know what I'm doing):







simulate this circuit &ndash; Schematic created using CircuitLab

As you can see, I used a PiFace, which comes with the four switches located at the left and towards the bottom of the photo. It is the wiring of this switch that befuddles me. Since each switch has two terminals, I was expecting one terminal to act as an input and the other as an output. That is, I just feed my circuit through those two terminals and job done. But that didn't work.

I managed to find this image online:



This is what prompted me to guess the configuration below, which works. However, I don't understand why it works. Nor do I understand why there are two terminals for each switch if only one seems to be used. I suspect the clue is embedded within the text in the above image:

It is powered by a 12V 1.0A wall wart, as well as by a standard USB connection.

There is an Arduino Duemilanove, which will draw 120mA for the Atmega328 as well as 50mA for the control pins.

Attached to the control pins are three Easydrivers, that are supposed to draw 150mA apiece, and they are connected to stepper motors with 6 Ohm windings. these easydrivers are powered from VIN.

Also powered from VIN is a 12V 2.08W fan, which will run continuously.

",Blue Ice,https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/24006,"If the drivers are good, they are constant current drivers so the coil resistance is irrelevant.  The fan draws 2W/12V = 170 mA.  So far that is 150*3 + 170 = 620 mA.  If the Arduino draws another 170 on top of that, then you're looking at 790 mA.  That leaves 210 mA of margin.  So it will probably work, but I would check on exactly how much current the motors draw to make sure you're not going to get any large transients.  The Arduino may end up drawing most of its current from USB, which would give you a bit more margin.  

Edit: I suppose the Arduino will not draw any current from the USB connection.  However, 170 mA is likely worst case and the actual draw will be significantly less.  The I/O figure will probably be far less if you're just sending logic signals as those are not actualy sourcing any significant current.

2169,2169,3458,Simple static integer stack,"This question is about improving my C++ coding skills. I was asked to implement a simple static integer stack in C++ as an assignment. I've come up with the following code:

class myStaticIntStack
{

    int stackSize;
    int storedElements;
    int *elements;

public:

    myStaticIntStack();
    myStaticIntStack( int aNumber );

    ~myStaticIntStack();

    int peek();

    int pop();

    void push( int element );

};

myStaticIntStack::myStaticIntStack()
{
    this-&gt;stackSize = 1;
    this-&gt;elements = new int(0);
    this-&gt;storedElements = 0;
}

myStaticIntStack::myStaticIntStack( int stackSize )
{
    this-&gt;stackSize = stackSize;
    this-&gt;elements = new int[ stackSize ];
    this-&gt;storedElements = 0;
}

myStaticIntStack::~myStaticIntStack()
{
    if( this-&gt;elements != NULL )
    {
        if( stackSize &gt; 1 )
            delete[] this-&gt;elements;
        else
            delete this-&gt;elements;
    }

}

void myStaticIntStack::push( int newElement )
{
    if( this-&gt;storedElements == this-&gt;stackSize )
        cout &lt;&lt; ""Stack is full, you must POP an element before PUSHing a new one!"" &lt;&lt; endl;
    else
    {
        this-&gt;elements[ (this-&gt;stackSize - 1) - this-&gt;storedElements ] = newElement;
        this-&gt;storedElements++;
    }
}

int myStaticIntStack::pop()
{
    if( this-&gt;storedElements == 0 )
    {
        cout &lt;&lt; ""Stack is empty, you must PUSH an element before POPping one!"" &lt;&lt; endl;
        return -1;
    }
    else
    {
        storedElements--;
        return this-&gt;elements[ (this-&gt;stackSize - 1) - this-&gt;storedElements ];
    }
}

int myStaticIntStack::peek()
{
    if( this-&gt;storedElements == 0 )
    {
        cout &lt;&lt; ""Stack is empty, you must PUSH an element before PEEKing one!"" &lt;&lt; endl;
        return -1;
    }
    else
    {
        return this-&gt;elements[ this-&gt;stackSize - this-&gt;storedElements ];
    }
}

int main()
{
    myStaticIntStack aStack(3);

    cout &lt;&lt; ""Popped Element: "" &lt;&lt; aStack.pop() &lt;&lt; endl;

    aStack.push(1);
    cout &lt;&lt; ""Stack Top is: "" &lt;&lt; aStack.peek() &lt;&lt; endl;
    aStack.push(2);
    cout &lt;&lt; ""Stack Top is: "" &lt;&lt; aStack.peek() &lt;&lt; endl;
    aStack.push(3);
    cout &lt;&lt; ""Stack Top is: "" &lt;&lt; aStack.peek() &lt;&lt; endl;
    aStack.push(4);
    cout &lt;&lt; ""Stack Top is: "" &lt;&lt; aStack.peek() &lt;&lt; endl;

    cout &lt;&lt; ""Popped Element: "" &lt;&lt; aStack.pop() &lt;&lt; endl;
    cout &lt;&lt; ""Stack Top is: "" &lt;&lt; aStack.peek() &lt;&lt; endl;
    cout &lt;&lt; ""Popped Element: "" &lt;&lt; aStack.pop() &lt;&lt; endl;
    cout &lt;&lt; ""Stack Top is: "" &lt;&lt; aStack.peek() &lt;&lt; endl;
    cout &lt;&lt; ""Popped Element: "" &lt;&lt; aStack.pop() &lt;&lt; endl;
    cout &lt;&lt; ""Stack Top is: "" &lt;&lt; aStack.peek() &lt;&lt; endl;

    return 0;
}


The code is compiling and running correctly, this is standard output:

Stack is empty, you must PUSH an element before POPping one! 
Popped Element: -1 
Stack Top is: 1 
Stack Top is: 2 
Stack Top is: 3 
Stack is full, you must POP an element before PUSHing a new one! 
Stack Top is: 3 
Popped Element: 3 
Stack Top is: 2 
Popped Element: 2 
Stack Top is: 1 
Popped Element: 1 
Stack is empty, you must PUSH an element before PEEKing one! 
Stack Top is: -1


However I was given a B due to the following reasons:


There was a better way of implementing it. 
I didn't manage well the case in which I'm trying to POP an element from an empty stack, since it's confusing that pop() returns a value even if Stack is empty.


Can you please help me understand how I could improve my code?
",Matteo,https://codereview.stackexchange.com/users/22916,"First of all, your code has a bug: You did not follow the rule of three.
Code such as myStack1 = myStack2; will cause the pointer to be deleted twice - which is undefined behavior.



int storedElements;


This seems kind of misleading. This variable doesn't hold the stored elements. It holds the number of stored elements. Perhaps storedElementsCount or something like that would be better?



myStaticIntStack( int aNumber );


Why did you call the variable aNumber here? aNumber is a terrible name. It tells me essentially nothing. Later you used stackSize which is a FAR better name. Why didn't you use it here too?

And, by the way, consider using size_t to store sizes and capacities instead of ints. This would apply to stackSize and storedElements.



myStaticIntStack::myStaticIntStack()
{
    this-&gt;stackSize = 1;
    this-&gt;elements = new int(0);
    this-&gt;storedElements = 0;
}


Seriously? The default behavior for the stack is to create a stack with maximum size 1? That is kind of... worthless. It's OK to allow this in the myStaticIntStack(int) constructor, but as a default it just seems odd.

Consider not even allowing a default constructor.



myStaticIntStack::myStaticIntStack( int stackSize )
{
    this-&gt;stackSize = stackSize;
    this-&gt;elements = new int[ stackSize ];
    this-&gt;storedElements = 0;
}


Can the stackSize be zero? Can it be negative? Consider adding an assertion.
By the way, if you make stackSize be a size_t, the negative case becomes impossible, since size_t is unsigned. But you'll still need to handle the ""stackSize == 0"" case.

A size of 0 might be acceptable. If that is the case, add a comment stating that and why it is so.

Consider declaring this constructor explicit.



myStaticIntStack::~myStaticIntStack()
{
    if( this-&gt;elements != NULL )
    {
        if( stackSize &gt; 1 )
            delete[] this-&gt;elements;
        else
            delete this-&gt;elements;
    }

}


Why do you need a NULL check? Are you expecting the destructor to be called with elements == NULL? If this merely defensive programming and this case is never supposed to happen, then leave it as an assertion.

Also, that whole delete vs delete[] is weird. What if I use the constructor myStaticIntStack(1)? Then you'll be deleteing something created with new[].

I'd change the code (from the constructors) so that new[] - not new - is always used and, therefore, delete[] is always the right thing to do in the destructor.



void myStaticIntStack::push( int newElement )
{
    if( this-&gt;storedElements == this-&gt;stackSize )
        cout &lt;&lt; ""Stack is full, you must POP an element before PUSHing a new one!"" &lt;&lt; endl;
    else
    {
        this-&gt;elements[ (this-&gt;stackSize - 1) - this-&gt;storedElements ] = newElement;
        this-&gt;storedElements++;
    }
}


This is improper error handling that violates the single responsibility principle.
Your function should either throw an exception, merely assert the condition or return an error code. Printing to the command line should be done elsewhere - probably outside this class.



this-&gt;elements[ (this-&gt;stackSize - 1) - this-&gt;storedElements ] = newElement;


I'm pretty sure you could simplify this. For a stackSize=16, the first position is at index 15. Why 15? Why not 0? That'd simplify the code to just elements[storedElements] = newElement;. Just remember to also fix the pop/peek code.

Just because the stack is Last-in-first-out doesn't mean you have to fill the last indexes in the internal array first. That's an implementation detail.




  it's confusing that pop() returns a value even if Stack is empty.


Then don't  return a value if the Stack is empty. Throw an exception or abort with an assertion. Problem solved. Next.
As I stated before, your couts are in the wrong place. If you fix that the ""Pop return"" problem might just naturally go away.

If you decide to keep it like that (return -1), then consider making -1 a named constant since magic numbers are bad.

return ERROR_STACK_IS_EMPTY;




int myStaticIntStack::peek()


Same thing about cout.
Also, peek() doesn't change anything, does it? Then consider making it const.

int myStaticIntStack::peek() const




Consider splitting your myStaticIntStack in two files: myStaticIntStack.hpp and myStaticIntStack.cpp.
Your main function would be in a third file.



Some extra thoughts:


I suspect the ""better way"" might be to just use a vector internally. This would painlessly solve your ""rule of three"" problem. Bonus points since it'd make it easier to ""resize"" the stack after being created if you ever wanted to add that feature.
Personally, I'd uppercase the first letter of the class name, but that's just personal preference. Nothing wrong with your particular style.
Consider adding a bool empty() function, that checks if the stack is empty.
Consider adding a bool full() function, that checks if the stack is full.
Those two functions above could make your error detection code easier to understand. If your assignment forbids adding extra functions, consider adding them as private functions.
Consider adding a int size() function, that returns storedElements.
Consider adding a int capacity() function, that returns stackSize
Normally, a class like this would be implemented as a template since it's useful to have stacks for more than just integers. Not sure if you've learned about templates yet.


If you follow QuentinUK's suggestion of removing the this-&gt;, beware. There is one case that might cause you trouble.
In the constructor, this-&gt;stackSize = stackSize; is correct, but stackSize = stackSize; would not be.
To work around this issue, you could use something like this:

/*optionally add ""explicit"" here*/ myStaticIntStack::myStaticIntStack( int stackSize ) :
    stackSize(stackSize)
{
    elements = new int[ stackSize ];
    storedElements = 0;
}


This is all I can think of right now. Hope this helps.

I don't raise an invoice and Amazon doesn't create one for me.

Even if I try this, there's no option to select a customer (eg, from a drop-down list), but only to type a customer name, which makes me wonder if the transaction actually gets tied to a customer in the Gnucash system.

Trade up Contracts give out skins based on what skins you put in.  The output skin is both one grade higher than the inputs (Industrial will give you a Mil-Spec, Mil-Spec will give you Restricted, etc) and must be from one of the collections of the skins input.

For example, you could put in 5 Glock 18 Catacomb skins and 5 AK-47 Elite Build skins.  Both of those skins are Industrial Grade skins, Catacombs is from the Chroma collection and Elite Build is from the Chroma 2 collection.  Thus, you can get out of it any Mil-Spec skin from either Chroma or Chroma 2 (namely, Dual Berettas Urban Shock, Desert Eagle Naga, MAC-10 Malachite, Sawed-Off Serenity, AWP Worm God, MAG-7 Heat, CZ75-Auto Pole Position, UMP-45 Grand Prix).

Some valves have a globe shape, but get misidentified by that shape because they actually are Gate Valves which have a vertical wedge shaped metal gate that gets pushed down into a tapered slot. These fail because sediment accumulates in the slot on the downwards side and the gate no longer can be pushed fully home so the taper seals. This requires the water to be turned off upstream so you can take the top off the valve, extract the gate and grub the sediment out using a piece of welding rod so it will flush out when you reassemble the valve.

I've gone over to using quarter turn ball valves when I have to go to this much trouble. They are better than Globe Valves because the opening is the same size as the inner diameter of the pipe when the valve is full open, the water doesn't have to turn 90 degrees to flow through a restriction as it does in a Globe valve and while the gate valve has the same lack of restriction as the ball, the ball valve has no slot for rust, sand and sediment to accumulate in while it spends most its life wide open.

  I don rubber gloves, bravely grab my pickup stick and swallow the remainder of my coffee. It’s not even midnight yet. I remember the advice of my former roommate who — once and again — occupied the same stool I stood up from.


Does the last sentence I italicized means his former roommate used to work at the shop before, and has again came back to work there for the second time?
",Theo,https://ell.stackexchange.com/users/1473,"I had never heard the expression ""once and again"" before!

According to Merriam Webster, it has the following definitions:


  once and once more
  
  two or more times
  
  now and again, from time to time, occasionally, sometimes


In the context, it seems to have the third definition - which, until now, I knew as ""now and again"" (which makes just as little literal sense, when you think about it!) or ""once in a while"".

It could be the first definition - s/he had had the job once before, and now has it again - but this requires two tenses, meaning the sentence would have to be restructured:


  ""who had once occupied, and once more occupied..."" (or ""who had once,
  and once more, occupied..."")


Similarly, ""two or more times"" requires ""had occupied:


  ""who had occupied - two or more times - ...""


This dictionary has only one definition for ""once and again"":


  repeatedly, as in ""He has been told once and again not to slam the
  door.""

","If you import a me2 character, you will automatically use role-playing mode (a mode with combat and dialogue options). Only when you create a new character can you get a choice at the beginning. The role-playing mode is the closest to the previous mode of mass effect games, so the game assumes that the players who import characters want to use this mode."

Yes, that's exactly right.

If a static method only refers to local variables, it is automatically thread safe. (In fact, this holds for non-static methods as well.)

Generally speaking though, I would say you should avoid static if possible. In general it makes code harder to test and to reason about due to the fact that static members are in a sense global.

  Unlike the co-ordinate singularity at $r = 2M$, the origin of the Schwarzschild metric $r = 0$ has a true curvature singularity. It was first believed that this singularity was an artifact of spherical symmetry and that a generic collapse would evade the singularity. However, work by Hawking and Penrose showed that this was not so and that singularities were generic rather than special. The ubiquity of singularities is guaranteed by the singularity theorems by Hawking and Penrose.

Nevertheless, there exist solutions in which the collapse of matter results in the formation of naked singularities. It's just the initial conditions for such solutions are 'special', often possessing high degree of symmetry (such as spherical symmetry), and thus would likely could not be realized in reality. 

Interestingly, the existence of such naked singularities was the subject of a bet between S. Hawking and J. Preskill/K. Thorne.

Is there any reason that sometimes a sharped key signature is used while at other times the equivalent flatted key signature is used?

As a related point, I have undoubtedly noticed the preference of certain ""equivalent"" key signatures over others.

  Bumping Ships from The Raiders' Outpost
  
  A question has been raised about how the ""Bump Rule"" works for the Raiders' Outpost if one or more ships in the original run have been removed, either by the Plasma Cannon, the Orbital Teleporter, or by losing control of the Relic Ship. Does the new run have to be bigger than the original run or just bigger than the ship that are left over?
  
  Here is the text from the rulebook...
  
  Raiders’ Outpost
  
  You must dock a set of three sequentially numbered ships to use the Raiders’ Outpost. There are docking ports for one set of three ships. If the Raiders’ Outpost is occupied, you may dock a higher-value sequence here and move the original ships to the Maintenance Bay.
  
  While docked at the Raiders’ Outpost you may steal a total of four resources from any mix of players or one alien tech card of your choice from one player. If you steal an alien tech card that you already have, the stolen card is discarded immediately and you gain no benefit from doing so.
  
  Example : If a 1-2-3 is docked at the Raiders’ Outpost and the next player rolls a 2-3-4 then that player may remove the 1-2-3 and dock their 2-3-4 at the facility to conduct their own raid. If another player rolls a 3-4-5 or a 4-5-6 then they may remove the 2-3-4 and dock their own sequence and conduct their own raid.


The addition of a second example should clear up this question.


  Example 2: RED has docked a 3-4-5 at the Raiders' Outpost. On his turn GREEN uses the Plasma Cannon to send the 5 back to the Maintenance Bay, leaving a 3 and 4 on the Raiders' Outpost. To dock a higher-value sequence at the Raiders' Outpost GREEN must use a run of three ships that totals more than the sum of the ships currently docked there. The remaining ships total 7 so GREEN may not dock a 1-2-3 since they only total 6. GREEN may dock a 2-3-4 (total 9), a 3-4-5 (total 12) or a 4-5-6 (total 15) to use the Raiders' Outpost.

They have not updated the @ A Record, this is still pointing to the mail server IP (which means the non www version of the site goes there instead). Am i not right in thinking that if you have the MX records set then the A Records for both www and @ can be set to a different server IP and will have no impact on the email (as this will be controlled purely by the MX records)? So I can change the @ a record to the new server ip as well and this won't affect their email right? Assuming this is okay will it screw up the RDNS or any of the other email validation techniques?

2356,2356,3756,Why Ionic compounds dissolve into water,"First, I would like to say that I understand the basic idea of disassociation and solubility. However, as I study intermolecular forces I feel like this basic Idea is being challenged. My understanding from basic chemistry is that ionic bonds are much stronger than covalent bonds, due to the actual exchange of electrons and the formation of cations and anions, causing an attractive force between the opposite charges to ""hold"" the compound together. When explaining solubility with IMF theory, however, I fail to understand how the IM forces present in water--dipole-dipole, H-bonds, and dispersion--are able to overcome that attraction between the cation and anion present in the ionic bond; because, I was under the impression that actual bonds are always stronger than IMF bonds. So, for instance, does it not infer that if, say, Sodium Chloride is placed into water, and the attraction of the h-bonds in water cause the NaCl to essentially break apart into ions, that the inherent attractions between cations and anions in an ionic compound are weaker than the attraction force of the h-bond water molecule?

Now you know that $a$ is a primitive root of $p^2$, so the order of $a$ modulo $p^2$ is $p(p-1)$. And we know that $a^{p-1}=1+kp$ for some $k$. Then the assumption that $a$ is a primitive root of $p^2$ implies that $k$ is not divisible by $p$. Therefore $$a^{p^n(p-1)}=(a^{p-1})^{p^n}=1+kp^{n+1}+mp^{n+2}$$ for some $m$.(This is the place where we make use of the binomial lemma.) This directly tells you that $a$ is a primitive root of $p^n$ for every $n\ge1$.  


   More Details.  We elaborate upon two things: Firstly, we show the centered equation, and, secondly, we show how that implies the primitivity of $a$.  For the first, use the lemma to deduce that $(a^{p-1})^{p}=1+kp\times p+\text{terms of higher powers of $p$}$. Now, by induction, the result follows. For the second, just divide $(a^{p-1})^{p^r}$ by $p^n$ for $k=0,1,\ldots,n-1$, to see that, for lower powers of $a$ than $(a^{p-1})^{p^{n-1}}$, it cannot be congruent to $1$ modulo $p^n$.

Why $1^n$ and $0^n$, and not other combinations?
","$0^n$ means a string of $n$ zeros (the $n$-bit string that is all zeros).  $1^n$ means a string of $n$ ones.

Why were these used?  There's nothing special about $0^n$ or $1^n$, in this context.  They could have used any pair of two constant $n$-bit strings, as long as the two strings were not the same.  $0^n$ and $1^n$ is a convenient choice of two strings that are different, but they could have chosen any other pair (as long as they're not both the same) and that would have worked fine, too.

1341,1341,2114,Questions on mass-production soldering,"Wave soldering

I am trying to understand how wave soldering works. Unfortunately the Wikipedia article has has left me unsure about the process:


Is the entire board with its components quasi-immersed in liquid solder while it passes through the wave? (If not, the following question probably make no sense.)
If the board cuts into the wave, how is the wave maintained?
Why does this not leave superflous solder residue on the board?


Double-Sided SMT soldering

How are double sided boards with SMT components soldered? How is it prevented that the components on one side fall off?
",ARF,https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/8534,"wave soldering
For wave soldering the PCB passes over a bath of molten solder where the solder is pushed up so that it strikes along the bottom side of the PCB. You'll need a solder resist mask to prevent to have solder over all the copper. 

Note that also SMDs can be wave soldered, but then the orientation of the parts is important. Some parts have to be placed perpendicular to the wave direction. Fine pitch parts like 0.4 mm QFPs can't be wave soldered because all the pins will be shorted, but QFPs with a higher pitch can. They need ""solder thieves"", which are solder pads at the end of a row of pins to gather residual solder.

  

A QFP may have to be placed at a 45° angle, and will have the solder thieves at one of the corners:  



The wave direction is important during PCB layout and panelization, and the production engineer should get clear instructions on it.

reflow soldering
SMDs for two-sided placement are glued on one side. After solder paste is applied with a stencil a glue dot machine places glue dots for the parts (at an incredible rate of more than 10 per second). Then the parts are placed, the panel is flipped over, and the other side gets solder paste and component placement.

This lookup has a performance impact, but in the case of xml parsing
the time to look up the implementation is small compared to the time needed to
actually parse a xml document. In the library I'm envisioning the factory
itself is pretty simple so the lookup time would dominate the performance.
Somehow cache the implementation class with the context classloader as the key.

5773,5773,9150,Warp 10 Barrier?,"I just watched S7E25 ""All Good Things ..."" of Star Trek: The Next Generation which I believe is the final episode of the series.

This is toward the end of the series. Is there any explanation in the Star Trek Universe which explains this seeming difference?

2452,2452,3914,Period of swinging incomplete hula-hoop,"I was working on a problem where I had to calculate the period of a swinging incomplete hula-hoop given its center of mass and radius.  It only swings with very small amplitude so I considered the motion as harmonic so therefore I attempted to use the equation $$T=2\pi (\sqrt{(\frac{I support}{mgK})}$$ Where K is the distance to the point of rotation to the center of mass.  My problem with this equation is that I don't know the moment of inertia and I'm not exactly sure how to calculate it.

Is my approach to this problem correct?

",user,https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/27600,"The moment of inertia, $I$, is, of course, given by 

$$I = \sum m_i r_i^2$$

You might need to calculate this by integration. 

$$I = \int_x ~r(x)^2 \rho dx$$

where

$$m = \int_x \rho dx$$

You integrate along the pendulum in infinitessimal steps of $dx$ and $r(x)$ is the function that determines $r$ as a function of $x$  and $\rho$ is density so $\rho dx = dm$, where $dm$ is the infinitessimal bit of mass at $dx$.

1986,1986,3164,Putting the cursor back at the bash prompt after a script returns delayed output,"Just a minor issue. I'm writing a simple bash script that starts and stops Jetty. When I execute it, the script immediately puts my cursor back on the bash prompt. However, as Jetty starts up and writes its initialization output back to stdout, it leaves the cursor on a line of its own (without a prompt) until I enter a command or hit enter. Nitpicking, I know, but I figure there's an easy way to avoid this that I'm missing.

Here's the script:

I'm writing a simple bash script that starts and stops Jetty. When I execute it, the script immediately puts my cursor back on the bash prompt. However, as Jetty starts up and writes its initialization output back to stdout, it leaves the cursor on a line of its own (without a prompt) until I enter a command or hit enter. Nitpicking, I know, but I figure there's an easy way to avoid this that I'm missing.

Here's the script:

#!/bin/bash

The evaporator which is inside the car is located under the dash on the passenger side.

What is not normal is that your A/C was not cooling properly. My suggestion is that your refrigerant is low, so is not cooling up to snuff. It only has to cool the air down past the dew point and it will draw water out of the air, even though it isn't really cold enough to cool the inside of the cabin. 

If you or your husband feels comfortable in doing this, there are ways you can check the refrigerant in your vehicle. I like the AC Pro Recharge Kit because it takes into account temperature variation which is needed to ensure you have the proper amount of refrigerant in your system.

travel must be in a straight line with the shortest possible distance.

as an extension to this question, how will i know if its better to wait, EG is it faster to stay on object A and wait for a hour when the objects may be closer, than to set off from A to B at the start.

It currently has one column, and I want to add another.

Now, on SQL Server 2008 this was a piece of cake, just did it in SSMS, poof. Done. 
This is how the PK looks like if I script it from SQL Server:

ALTER TABLE [dbo].[Friend] ADD  CONSTRAINT [PK_Friend] PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED 
(
  [UserId] ASC,
  [Id] ASC
)


However, on SQL Azure, when I try to execute the above, it will of course fail:

Table 'Friend' already has a primary key defined on it.

Fine, so I try to drop the key:

Tables without a clustered index are not supported in this version of SQL Server. Please create a clustered index and try again.

Ok, so I try to create a temporary clustered index in order to drop the PK:

CREATE CLUSTERED INDEX IX_Test ON [Friend] ([UserId],[Id])


Which results in: 
Cannot create more than one clustered index on table 'Friend'. Drop the existing clustered index 'PK_Friend' before creating another.

How do I add the UserId column to my existing PK?
",Magnus,https://dba.stackexchange.com/users/3949,"Note: as of Azure SQL Database v12, these restrictions no longer apply.

The is no such thing as a 'primary index'. There is such a thing as a 'primary key' and also there is such a thing as a 'clustered index'. Distinct concepts, often confused. With this distinction in mind, lets revisit the question:

Q1) Can the clustered index in a SQL Azure table be modified?
A: Yes. Use  WITH (DROP_EXISTING=ON):

create table Friend (
    UserId int not null,
    Id int not null);
go  
create clustered index cdxFriend on Friend (UserId, Id);
go
create clustered index cdxFriend on Friend (Id, UserId) with (drop_existing=on);
go


Q2) Can the clustered index of a table that has a primary key constraint be modified?
A: Yes, same as above, as long as the primary key constraint is not enforced via the clustered index:

create table Friend (
    UserId int not null,
    Id int not null identity(1,1),
    constraint pk_Friend primary key nonclustered (Id));
create clustered index cdxFriend on Friend (UserId, Id);
go
create clustered index cdxFriend on Friend (Id, UserId) with (drop_existing=on);
go


Q3) Can the primary key constraint of a table be modified?
A: Yes, as long as the primary constraint is not enforced via the clustered index:

create table Friend (
    UserId int not null,
    Id int not null identity(1,1),
    constraint pk_Friend primary key nonclustered (Id));
go
create clustered index cdxFriend on Friend (UserId, Id);
go
alter table Friend drop constraint pk_Friend;
alter table Friend add constraint pk_Friend primary key nonclustered (UserId)
go


Q4) Can the primary key of a table be modified when is enforced via the clustered index?
A: Yes, if the table never had any rows:

create table Friend (
    UserId int not null,
    Id int not null identity(1,1),
    constraint pk_Friend primary key clustered (UserId, Id));
go
alter table Friend drop constraint pk_Friend;
alter table Friend add constraint pk_Friend primary key clustered (Id, UserId)
go


Q5) Can the primary key of a table be modified when is enforced via the clustered index if the table is populated?
A: No. Any operation that converts a populated clustered index into a heap will be blocked in SQL Azure, even if the table is empty:

create table Friend (
    UserId int not null,
    Id int not null identity(1,1),
    constraint pk_Friend primary key clustered (UserId, Id));
go
insert into Friend (UserId) values (1);
delete from Friend;
go
alter table Friend drop constraint pk_Friend;


As a side note: the constraint can be modified if the table is truncated. 

The workaround to change the PK constraint of a populated table is to do the good old sp_rename trick:

create table Friend (
    UserId int not null,
    Id int not null identity(1,1),
    constraint pk_Friend primary key clustered (UserId, Id));
go
insert into Friend (UserId) values (1);
go

create table FriendNew (
    UserId int not null,
    Id int not null identity(1,1),
    constraint pk_Friend_New primary key clustered (Id, UserId));
go

set identity_insert FriendNew on;
insert into FriendNew (UserId, Id) 
select UserId, Id
from Friend;
set identity_insert FriendNew off;
go

begin transaction
exec sp_rename 'Friend', 'FriendOld';
exec sp_rename 'FriendNew', 'Friend';
commit;
go

sp_help 'Friend';


The sp_rename approach has some issues, most importantly being that permissions on the table do not carry over during the rename, as well as foreign key constraints.

It currently has one column, and I want to add another.

Now, on SQL Server 2008 this was a piece of cake, just did it in SSMS, poof. Done. 
This is how the PK looks like if I script it from SQL Server:

ALTER TABLE [dbo].[Friend] ADD  CONSTRAINT [PK_Friend] PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED 
(
  [UserId] ASC,
  [Id] ASC
)


However, on SQL Azure, when I try to execute the above, it will of course fail:

Table 'Friend' already has a primary key defined on it.

Fine, so I try to drop the key:

Tables without a clustered index are not supported in this version of SQL Server. Please create a clustered index and try again.

Ok, so I try to create a temporary clustered index in order to drop the PK:

CREATE CLUSTERED INDEX IX_Test ON [Friend] ([UserId],[Id])


Which results in: 
Cannot create more than one clustered index on table 'Friend'. Drop the existing clustered index 'PK_Friend' before creating another.

4158,4158,6629,Determining The Parameters Of A Wheatstone Bridge,"Good day, 

I am trying to use a Wheatstone bridge to condition a thermistor. The arrangement i have is shown in below.

I need the following specifications.


10V output max from the bridge at maximum temperature (50 degrees celcius)
0V output max from the bridge at minimum temperature (0 degrees celcius)


I have determined the resistance of the thermistor at the minimum and maximum temperature to be as follows


At max temperature R = 174
At min temperature R = 1.1K


I know that for the wheatstone bridge to be balanced i need the following for my arrangement

R1/R3 = R2/Rt

So i have set R3 = 1.1K and Chose R1=R2=1500k (arbitrary value)

With this i do get 0V output at 0 degrees.

My problem is now, how do i ensure that the output voltage i get is 10V at 50 degree celcius, as i currently get 8.7V output with the source voltage set to 24V.

Any help would be appreciated, Thanks.
",Ozwurld,https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/69443,"With a 24 volt supply, the current thru the limb of the bridge containing the thermistor is: -


Nearly 11mA at 0C
Nearly 19mA at 50C


At 0C this produces a power in the thermistor of 132mW and 63mW at 50C. To me this is a problem. The self-heating of the thermistor will create a significant measurment error at 0C compared to 50C. I'd use an instrumentation amplifier and keep the excitation levels much lower to prevent significant self-heating errors: -



The picture above shows the AD620 powered from +5V and 0V but a better power regime (for the OP) is +/- 15V with 0V connected to pin 5 (the reference input). The excitation voltage can be much lower (say 2.5 volts) and this means the self-heating effects are 1.5mW at 0C and 0.7mW at 50C i.e. trivial.

However, there is another potential problem of a single thermistor in a wheatstone bridge and that is linearity. You may design a circuit that produces the correct voltages at the extremes of temperature you require but, between these two points, there is a non-linear mapping between voltage and temperature over and above the basic non-linearity of the thermistor's resistance change with temperature.

It might seem intuitive to place 2 thermistors at opposite sides of the bridge but, with voltage excitation, this won't improve linearity (but does double sensitivity). Here is a good document by ADI explaining all of this: -



However, if you adopted a current driven bridge configuration then you could use two thermistors and get perfect linearity: -



So, rounding up, try to avoid self-heating effects and, for greater linearity, use two elements in opposing faces of the bridge with the bridge excitation being a constant current like the one below: -



The important voltage to keep constant in the above diagram is that across R1 and, for high accuracy a precision shunt voltage reference would be used in place of R1.

Instead, consider setting a boolean value to false at the beginning of each iteration and setting it to true in the vowel branches.

2825,2825,4498,Need help with a subsets problem,"With the set $X=\{1,2,...,n\}$, How many subsets of $X$ contain $1$? How many subsets of $X$ don't contain $1$?

My work: 
I know a set with $n$ elements has $2^n$ subsets. The way I tackled this problem was to make a finite set like {1,2,3} and tried to make some generalization from it. I made a decision tree diagram to figure out the different subsets. 

If $1$ was contained in the subset, then the different subsets with $1$ would be:
$$\{1,2,3\},\{1,2\},\{1,3\},\{1\} $$ 
which made me think there are four subsets. $2^n = 4$ which means $n=2$ but there are 3 elements in here so I generalized it as:
$$2^{n-1}$$
where $n \ge 1$ such that $n \in N $ is how many subsets of X that contain $1$.

And for the subsets of $X$ that don't contain $1$, the answer should come out the same as the previous question because, again, if I were to make a finite set like $\{1,2,3\}$, then the subsets without $1$ would be:
$$\{2,3\}, \{2\}, \{3\},  \{\emptyset\}  $$

which is also, $$2^{n-1}$$
where $n \ge 1$ such that $n \in N $ is how many subsets of X that don't contain $1$.

I think it makes sense in my head but I am still unsure. Am I understanding this problem correctly or am I completely missing it? 
",Jeff Thykes,https://math.stackexchange.com/users/92014,"You've found the correct result; you just have to prove it. HINT: There's a bijection between the sets that contain $1$ and the sets that don't: if $1\in A$, pair $A$ with $A\setminus\{1\}$.

How many subsets of $X$ don't contain $1$?

My work: 
I know a set with $n$ elements has $2^n$ subsets. The way I tackled this problem was to make a finite set like {1,2,3} and tried to make some generalization from it. I made a decision tree diagram to figure out the different subsets. 

If $1$ was contained in the subset, then the different subsets with $1$ would be:
$$\{1,2,3\},\{1,2\},\{1,3\},\{1\} $$ 
which made me think there are four subsets. $2^n = 4$ which means $n=2$ but there are 3 elements in here so I generalized it as:
$$2^{n-1}$$
where $n \ge 1$ such that $n \in N $ is how many subsets of X that contain $1$.

And for the subsets of $X$ that don't contain $1$, the answer should come out the same as the previous question because, again, if I were to make a finite set like $\{1,2,3\}$, then the subsets without $1$ would be:
$$\{2,3\}, \{2\}, \{3\},  \{\emptyset\}  $$

which is also, $$2^{n-1}$$
where $n \ge 1$ such that $n \in N $ is how many subsets of X that don't contain $1$.

I think it makes sense in my head but I am still unsure. Am I understanding this problem correctly or am I completely missing it? 
","You've found the correct result; you just have to prove it. HINT: There's a bijection between the sets that contain $1$ and the sets that don't: if $1\in A$, pair $A$ with $A\setminus\{1\}$. Alternatively, each set that does not contain $1$ is a subset of the $(n-1)$-element set $\{2,\ldots,n\}$, and you know how many subsets that has.

So the fold change for that gene will be calculated by $E_{gene}^{-\Delta Ct_{gene}}$

Where:

$\Delta Ct  = Ct^{treated} -Ct^{control}$

But these Ct values are not normalized. For normalization, you take some reference gene which need not be a housekeeping gene. Reference gene should chosen such that it is not affected by the treatment. In some cases usual housekeeping genes can also get affected for e.g. in treatments affecting cell cycle or differentiation. In such cases you should use a spike-in (an artificial RNA bearing low resemblance with any known gene).

You can either normalize the fold change (Case A) or find fold change of the normalized expression (Case B).

Case A:

$E_{gene}^{-\Delta Ct_{gene}} / E_{ref}^{-\Delta Ct_{ref}}$

Case B:

$\large\frac{[E_{gene}^{-Ct^{treated}_{gene}}]/[E_{ref}^{-Ct^{treated}_{ref}}]} {[E_{gene}^{-Ct^{control}_{gene}}]/[E_{ref}^{-Ct^{control}_{ref}}]}$

You can rearrange the numerator and denominator to get Case A from Case B. I'm not sure how you are ending up getting different values. Recheck once. It may be because of numerical approximation errors. 

Case A looks much neater; so it is best to calculate that way :)

2928,2928,4661,How can I build a switching circuit that scales several 12v signals down to <5v?,"Let me start off by saying that I know just enough about electronics to be dangerous (how to solder, follow a simple schematic, and check for connectivity problems and usually figure out what each wire is for).

I've installed a cruise control kit in my car, and I want to use a set of Honda steering wheel controls instead of the stock controls from the kit.  The cruise kit controls are expecting 12 volts, but I'm not comfortable running any more than 5 volts through the small steering wheel wires next to the airbag wiring.  I'd prefer even less, like 2-3 volts.

So I need to build a switching circuit that will provide the 12 volt signals to the cruise kit.  I was thinking of keeping it solid-state, since I don't know of any relays that will switch on 2-3 volts.  However, if there's a good reason to use relays then I can.

Here's a rough drawing of what I need:



How can I get started with this project?
",jnylen,https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/1610,"To answer your question, you just need to convert the low voltage to a high voltage by use of a transistor switch. Using a BJT transistor will work, but I recommend using a MOSFET. They are more efficient and can handle more power without getting hot due to the very low ""on"" resistance. Consider this circuit:



The P channel MOSFET gate is pulled HI by RA, so it is turned ""OFF."" Remember, P channel transistors (or PNP) work opposite to that of N channel transistors (OR NPN). Since the FET is OFF, the outputs signal is pulled LO by RB.

If a switch is closed/pressed, then the FET gate is LO, turning the FET ""ON."" Now, the transistor acts like a switch, connecting the output to the 12V power source. There is a bit of loss in the transistor, but not a lot. Using a ""Power MOSFET"" is necessary to handle the level of current required to operate an automotive relay - not a problem since many of these transistors can switch dozens of amps.

Since the MOSFET is a voltage controlled device, only a negligible amount of current would be needed to control the transistor (this is the current through your steering wheel wires). A similar circuit could be made using an N channel MOSFET instead. See this website on using a MOSFET as a switch:

http://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/transistor/tran_7.html

But realistically, this is all probably unnecessary. Have a look at the wire gauge table on this website:

You will see that the few hundred mA needed to trip a relay are safely carried in wire size all the way down to 27 gauge (handles 288 mA). You should check those wires to see how big they actually are (usually printed on the side of the wire somewhere).

892,892,1416,"Managing without Objects in C - And, why can I declare variables anywhere in a function in C?","everyone. I actually have two questions, somewhat related.

Question #1: Why is gcc letting me declare variables after action statements? I thought the C89 standard did not allow this. (GCC Version: 4.4.3) It even happens when I explicitly use --std=c89 on the compile line. I know that most compilers implement things that are non-standard, i.e. C compilers allowing // comments, when the standard does not specify that. I'd like to learn just the standard, so that if I ever need to use just the standard, I don't snag on things like this.

Question #2: How do you cope without objects in C? I program as a hobby, and I have not yet used a language that does not have Objects (a.k.a. OO concepts?) -- I already know some C++, and I'd like to learn how to use C on it's own. Supposedly, one way is to make a POD struct and make functions similar to StructName_constructor(), StructName_doSomething(), etc. and pass the struct instance to each function - is this the 'proper' way, or am I totally off?

EDIT: Due to some minor confusion, I am defining what my second question is more clearly: I am not asking How do I use Objects in C? I am asking How do you manage without objects in C?, a.k.a. how do you accomplish things without objects, where you'd normally use objects?

In advance, thanks a lot. I've never used a language without OOP! :)

c89 doesn't allow this, but c99 does. Although it's taken a long time to catch on, some compilers (including gcc) are finally starting to implement c99 features.
IMO, if you want to use OOP, you should probably stick to C++ or try out Objective C. Trying to reinvent OOP built on top of C again just doesn't make much sense.


If you insist on doing it anyway, yes, you can pass a pointer to a struct as an imitation of this -- but it's still not a good idea.

It does often make sense to pass (pointers to) structs around when you need to operate on a data structure. I would not, however, advise working very hard at grouping functions together and having them all take a pointer to a struct as their first parameter, just because that's how other languages happen to implement things.

If you happen to have a number of functions that all operate on/with a particular struct, and it really makes sense for them to all receive a pointer to that struct as their first parameter, that's great -- but don't feel obliged to force it just because C++ happens to do things that way.

Edit: As far as how you manage without objects: well, at least when I'm writing C, I tend to operate on individual characters more often. For what it's worth, in C++ I typically end up with a few relatively long lines of code; in C, I tend toward a lot of short lines instead.

There is more separation between the code and data, but to some extent they're still coupled anyway -- a binary tree (for example) still needs code to insert nodes, delete nodes, walk the tree, etc. Likewise, the code for those operations needs to know about the layout of the structure, and the names given to the pointers and such.

Personally, I tend more toward using a common naming convention in my C code, so (for a few examples) the pointers to subtrees in a binary tree are always just named left and right. If I use a linked list (rare) the pointer to the next node is always named next (and if it's doubly-linked, the other is prev). This helps a lot with being able to write code without having to spend a lot of time looking up a structure definition to figure out what name I used for something this time.

",arvinsim,https://expressionengine.stackexchange.com/users/636,"So yeah. Parse order. I take it you've seen this pdf. If not, take a look, study it well.

What you need is for the opening tag to be in order before you hit stage 5: the parsing of module/plugin tags. In order to do that, you can only use simple conditionals in combination with early parsed global variables and preload replace variables. Native early parsed vars are limited, so go and get the super useful (and free) Mo' Variables to get more useful early parsed stuff.

Once installed, you can use {if paginated}{/if} as a simple conditional. Just beware you don't use any AND or OR operators, nor use {if:else} in your conditionals, because that will turn it into an advanced one, and will be parsed too late for your use.

First of all, this: {if {segment_2} == ''} is an advanced conditional. The simple syntax is {if segment_2 == ''}. Using tags in conditionals, like you do with the {exp:segment_search} tag, means the conditional is advanced, too. So, avoid.

Here's my take, using preload replace vars and simple conditionals only.

    {preload_replace:pre_query=''}

Amplitude and frequency remains same and also wavelength is same, so are they same?? I could not detect any difference from hearing two sounds. If different what is different and can human/computer detect it? What is basically difference between two waves?
",REALFREE ,https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/33887,"Actually, one wave and its 180 flip phase image can be seen as two waves with the same phase but with opposite amplitude (when one is positive the other is negative). 

The reason you cannot hear the difference between the two is that your ear (or microphone) is not sensitive to the amplitude but rather to the intensity of the wave, i.e. the square of the absolute value of the amplitude. As you can see, the difference in amplitude sign (or the phase) does not matter and both the original and its 180 flip phase image will sound the same.

What you would like to measure to see the difference between the two is the phase of the waves but as mentioned earlier, you cannot detect the phase directly. However you can measure the interference between the waves : when waves are emitted simulatenously they sum up. Now if the two waves have the same phase, then the amplitude add up (constructive interference). If the phases are 180 degree apart, then the amplitudes will cancel out (destructive interference, mentioned above).

66,66,104,Interaction of the Cold extraordinary ability and Grapples,"According to the Cold[EX] ability of an Ice Golem


  An ice golem's body generates intense cold, dealing 1d6 points of damage with its touch. 


If a Golem were to initiate a grapple, would this ability trigger dealing damage to grappled target?

If so, would this be on the Golem's turn, on the target's turn, or on both turns?
",Nyoze,https://rpg.stackexchange.com/users/23186,"Rules as Written

It may seem that way, but the ability further clarifies how it works:

Cold (Ex)


  An ice golem's body generates intense cold, dealing 1d6 points of
  damage with its touch. Creatures attacking an ice golem with unarmed
  strikes or natural weapons take this same cold damage each time one of
  their attacks hits.


So two things happen because of this ability:


The golem slam attacks deal an additional 1d6 cold damage, that can be seen on his stat block: 


  Melee 2 slams +9 (1d6+3 plus 1d6 cold)

And the ability specifies that anyone attacking the golem with unarmed or natural attacks will take 1d6 cold damage. If it also worked against grapple attempts with barehands, it should specify so.


If a simple touch would also cause that damage, the ability would make that clear, because it would also affect casters trying to deliver touch spells.
As written, all rules must be clear how an ability should work or not, anything that isn't clear is left for each GM to decide, which brings us to...

Rules as Intended

Though the ability's wording is clear that simply touching it shouldnt cause the extra damage to you, that is clearly not how it is intended to work. But i simply believe nobody asked themselves What would happen if someone tried to grapple this guy? during the development process.

A fine example of that are Fire Elementals and their Burn ability. What should happen when you hug a big ball of flames? You should hurt yourself in the process, and most likely catch on fire.

Personally, this is how i would rule it on my table.


  If a Golem were to initiate a grapple, would this ability trigger
  dealing damage to grappled target?


Now, if a fire elemental or ice golem initiated a grapple, RaW it wouldnt deal an extra damage, because you can attack the grappled target with a unarmed, natural weapon or light/1handed weapon, that should deal the ice damage.
But RaI, it would be really nasty to get your arm/leg freeze while being punched in the face by ice blocks. Golems hardly would initiate a grapple due to their intelligence score, but i could see a fire elemental doing so to bring a burning death to their foes.


  If so, would this be on the Golem's turn, on the target's turn, or on
  both turns?

2915,2915,4639,How can I model a human who gets powers from a part-time symbiote alien?,"I had an idea for a Mutants and Masterminds (2e) character based on a video game character idea of mine: a Gestalt consisting of a human male and a smaller, roughly cat-sized alien symbiote. As a Gestalt, the symbiote could provide augmentations for the human by fusing its body mass with various regions of the human's body (i.e. arms for strength or reach, legs for speed and jump height, forming wings on his back for gliding), but due to its small size, it can only provide one benefit at a time, but can take an action to switch what benefit it is providing. 

Individually though, things work differently; the human doesn't have any powers of his own (except maybe above-average physical stats as a side effect of his little friend) while the symbiote not only has small size and shapeshifting abilities, but also can bond with and control other humans to aid and protect his owner, though it cannot provide the same augmentations as when it is bonded to its owner.

I am aware there are powers available for this concept to work, I'm just wondering if the whole ""human without powers + small non-human with powers"" joint combo could be done within the game's rules. Is it possible, and if not, what would I need to change?

","Let $g$ be a primitive root $\pmod{p^2}$. Then $p|(g^{p-1}-1)$ by Fermat's little theorem and $p^2 \nmid (g^{p-1}-1)$ since $g$ is a primitive root. Thus by Lifting the Exponent Lemma, $p^{n-1}\|((g^{p-1})^{p^{n-2}}-1)$ and $p^n\|((g^{p-1})^{p^{n-1}}-1)$, so $g$ is also a primitive root $\pmod{p^n}, n&gt;1$.

Edit: More details: Let $d$ be the order of $g \pmod{p^n}, n&gt;1$. Since $g$ is a primitive root $\pmod{p^2}$, we have $p(p-1) \mid d$. By above, $d|p^{n-1}(p-1), d\nmid p^{n-2}(p-1)$, so $d=p^{n-1}(p-1)$, and thus $g$ is a primitive root $\pmod{p^n}, n&gt;1$.

It's possible if you rape physics, definitions, and just organize things so that you actually, in the end, obtain time from dimensional analysis. The idea would go along this line of reasoning:


I know a man walks 5 km/h, hence
space is a unit of time because I can say 10 km is equivalent to two hours, hence
I can measure time by specifying a distance. Let's meet in 5 kilometers at the pub 200 meters from here.


But that's not a unit definition. it's just a deep misrepresentation of concepts: using this approach, you can define everything in terms of anything else, assuming there's a relationship among them. you could define time in terms of weight of apples a man can move from the tree to a box.

Also, the whole setup is pretty circular in definition. You define time as space traveled by something at a constant speed for a defined time, so in the end your pulled you own bootstraps.

A Fourier transform is nothing but finding the coefficients of a linear combination of plane waves. When you find these coefficients, you can express the original function as the linear combination of these coefficients and a plane wave. If you note, there's a unit relationship between the domain before the FT and after. seconds -> seconds^(-1) = Hz. So even if you want to do fourier decomposition of a space-based periodic or aperiodic system, the resulting domain will be in meters^(-1), which is eventually a wave number. 


  Clarify this to the guy who
  posted last. Now the new signal is in
  a domain defined by me and so is its
  units.


Nope, it just turns out from the dimensional analysis that this is not the case. Clearly, you can always transform your frobbles units into Hertz through an ad-hoc transformation you invent (see the man-apples above) but that would still not change the final dimensional analysis of your FT, and you would, in any case, introduce an arbitrary constant (in our case above, the walking speed) which, in the end, likely produces a circular definition.

Lightyears is a measure of distance. It is a product of two well defined constants: the speed of light and a well defined amount of time. Simple dimensional analysis tells you it's a distance.

It needs a base resistor for the BJT or use a logic-level MOSFET. R1 could be something like 10K and the base resistor 20K or so. The p-channel MOSFET should be logic level for your conditions. You can find dual p/n channel units in an SO8 that can handle some amperes. 

The problem with switching the ground connection (low side switch) is that there are two power supplies on the chip and the inputs will end up biased at some voltage above ground, which may draw unnecessary current and/or be bad for your micro. 

You still have to bring the outputs of your micro low or you will drive unnecessary current into the L298 inputs.

Is the wizard able to direct their soul pieces such that they can choose what becomes a horcrux? Tied into that question, it seems possible that a wizard can kill someone and not create a horcrux (Peter Pettigrew killed Cedric Digory but no one seemed concerned that Peter made a horcrux), so how/why did Harry Potter wind up with a sliver of Voldemort's soul when it seems inconceivable that Voldemort's intention was to put one there?

3401,3401,5423,Mechanical Equivalent of Heat,"Recently I have been looking up James Joule's experiment regarding the mechanical equivalent of heat.  After viewing some drawings of the apparatus, I assumed that the lines holding the weights would have to be attached to the drum.  They would then be allowed to fall completely through a certain distance until the lines were at full length and the mechanical motion of the fluid would have to be allowed to continue to flow, causing the weights to be pulled up a bit and drop again, oscillating up and down until the motion stopped and all of the mechanical energy from the weights would be transferred into the fluid.

However, upon watching some videos, (this video is about 14 minutes long; but, if you advance to about 5 min 30 sec, it will show the experiment in question.) I noticed that the weights were allowed to be stopped by a level surface (an external force) instead of doing what I have described above.  To me, this means the weights were still in motion and, therefore, still had KE that was not transferred into the fluid.  

Of course, the weights are moving very slowly, much more slowly than if they had been allowed to free-fall through the distance; so, their kinetic energy is very small compared to the potential energy they lost, meaning the vast majority of the potential energy was transferred into the fluid and into other, small energy losses.

Should I assume the speeds of the weights were small enough to ignore the KE in the weights?

The assumption seems to be that the potential energy lost by the falling weights was all transferred into the fluid.  However, in the experiments, the lines have to be wound back up and the weights dropped several times in order to make a measurable difference in temperature.  Each time the weights fall, they are stopped by an external force, meaning they have kinetic energy that is not transferred into the fluid after falling through a measured distance.  It seems to me that some of the potential energy from the weights is transferred into the fluid; but, some of it is transferred into the kinetic energy of the weights falling.
",Michael E. Mall,https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/24443,"Watching the video$\, \!^{*}$ I'd estimate the relevant dropping height $h$ and dropping speed $v$ (close to reaching the ground, and probably nearly constant for much of the drop) conveniently at about

$h \approx$ 1.0 m, and $v \approx$ 0.1 m/s.

Thus

$W_{pot}/m = g ~ h \approx$ 10 m^2/s^2

while

$E_{kin}/m = 1/2 v^2 \approx$ 0.005 m^2/s^2.

[Additional remark: 
Joule himself would have easily been able to calculate and account for this,  of course (and likely he did); and more precisely, too, based on measuring values of $h$ and $v$ of his actual setup.]

Therefore the ratio of kinetic energy of the weight (at the end of dropping) and its initial potential energy happens to be fairly close to the relative difference between the values of ""original calculation"" and  ""modern measurements"" you provided,

One important thing to do, after lubing, is to use a rag to wipe the outside of the chain.  This removes a lot of grime and also removes excess lube that will attract more grime.

I generally use a chain washer system about once a season (and when I was commuting regularly I'd use it about once a month).  Others do more, less, or none at all.

(FWIT, I also generally use a Teflon or wax-based ""dry"" lube, though I used to switch to something heavier when I did winter riding.)

449,449,701,Dealing with non-required user input,"I'm working on a page where a user can create new records, but not all values are required. When creating the SqlCommand with potentially null values, I'm wondering what's the best way, from a code readability standpoint, to check if there's any valid/useful information in a given field. If there is, add that information to the command, if there's isn't, add a DBNull. 

Let's say we have a textbox, Address, which is non-compulsory (comm is the SqlCommand):

if(String.IsNullOrEmpty(Address.Text))
{
    comm.Parameters.AddWithValue(""@Address"", (Object) DBNull.Value)
}
else
{
    comm.Parameters.AddWithValue(""@Address"", (Object) Address.Text);
}


That seems like a lot of unnecessary typing. But trying to get clever and condense it into a single statement:            

comm.Parameters.AddWithValue(""@Address"",
     String.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(Address.Text) ?
     (Object) DBNull.Value :
     (Object) Address.Text
     );


That seems a little too condensed, harder to parse and understand. Not too difficult to figure out, but (at least to me), also not immediately apparent what's going on. So a trade-off:

Object addressParam = 
    String.IsNullOrEmpty(Address.Text) ?
    (Object) DBNull.Value :
    (Object) Address.Text;

 comm.Parameters.AddWithValue(""@Address"", addressParam);

",MikeTheLiar,https://codereview.stackexchange.com/users/28725,"If LINQ sounds like a foreign language, this might not be your most immediately productive option, but Entity Framework isn't that new, and you'd be astonished at how neatly it abstracts away all this boilerplate code. This isn't really a review, because it's a completely different approach, but for what it's worth I find the first listing perfectly readable and much better than casting anything to Object, even if AddWithValue actually takes an Object - I prefer these conversions implicit.

So here it goes - say you have an entity like this:

public class Client
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string FirstName { get; set; }
    public string LastName { get; set; }
    public DateTime? DateOfBirth { get; set; } // this one is nullable, DateTime? is shorthand for Nullable&lt;DateTime&gt;
    public string Address { get; set; }
}


You can easily find lots of tutorials online about using Entity Framework, but for the sake of displaying your case, you'll need a class that derives from DbContext to hold all your DbSets, which hold your entities:

public class MyContext : DbContext
{
    public MyContext(string connectionString)
        : base(connectionString)
    { }

    public IDbSet&lt;Client&gt; Clients { get; set; }

    public override void OnModelCreating(DbModelBuilder modelBuilder)
    {
        // customize entity mappings here
        base.OnModelCreating(modelBuilder);
    }
}


There are multiple ways to do this, but whatever you do EF needs to know how entities map to tables and properties map to columns - hence Object/Relational Mapper, and if you don't do anything about it EF will try to make it work by convention, and this means you only write the mapping/ModelBuilder code you need to write.

Now that you've got your entity and a context (you'll need proper configuration in app.config, and the connection string to use can be also inferred from config/context), you're ready to use it.

First thing you'll need is to decouple you UI from your data. This may seem redundant, but you'll want a ViewModel for use in your UI, rather than directly using the entity type (although that would still work). The idea is to not expose stuff that doesn't belong on the UI, notably the Id:

public class ClientViewModel
{
    public string FirstName { get; set; }
    public string LastName { get; set; }
    public DateTime? DateOfBirth { get; set; }
    public string Address { get; set; }
}


Now this is nice if all you need is to create new clients or display existing ones, but at one point you'll want to update an existing client and you'll want that Id back. I've posted my idea for converting between data and presentation types here on CR, and got good feedback - it was meant for use with WPF, but it can't hurt to take a look ;)

So, assuming we don't care about the Id of an existing Client yet, and only want to create a new one. What your UI code will do is fill up a ClientViewModel instance, with all the required and missing optional values.

I'm not very familiar with web dev (I know, I really should get into that), but I'd try to databind my ViewModel with the form fields (I'm sure it's supported), again to minimize boilerplate code.

Then you can have a ""Model"" class that works with your DbContext to do all the gruntwork - which is nowhere near the kind of gruntwork you're :

public class MyModel
{
    private readonly MyContext _context;

    public MyModel(MyContext context)
    {
        _context = context;
    }

    public void AddClientAndSave(ClientViewModel client)
    {
        var entity = new Client 
                          { 
                              FirstName = client.FirstName,
                              LastName = client.LastName,
                              DateOfBirth = client.DateOfBirth,
                              Address = client.Address

        _context.Clients.Add(entity);

    }

Just an example, but you get the point: no one gives a rat's ass about which field maps to a nullable or required column, except the mapping code. When you save your new client, give it a null value if that's what you need, provide an actual value if that's what you want. That's all! No SqlCommand, no parameters, no inline sql or anything.

For example, on Heathrow Airport's site they say:


  Make sure your electronic devices are charged before you travel. If your device doesn’t switch on when requested, you won’t be allowed to bring it onto the aircraft.


I travel with an electric violin, not so that I can rock-out during business trips but so that my practise does not disturb people in neighbouring hotel rooms since the electric violin is near-silent without an amplifier.

Will my electric violin fall foul of new airport security restrictions? If so how does one prove that an electric violin (or any other active electronic instrument) is ""turned on"" without an amplifier to hand?
","I doubt it will be a problem, but there are many ways to connect your guitar to your mobile phone. I guess the output signal of the electric violin is the same, so it can be used on the guitar amplifier. If so, you can use one of them with your smartphone, and it will produce some kind of sound. Or more simply, use one of the portable exercise devices, which is just a 1 / 4 ""plug and a small box, and you can also connect headphones."

4053,4053,6470,Can symmetry be restored in high energy scattering?,"Suppose you have a field theory with a real scalar field $\phi$ and a potential term of the form $\lambda \phi^4 - \mu \phi^2$ that breaks the symmetry $\phi \to - \phi$ in the ground state. Is this symmetry restored in a scattering with high momentum transfer in any physically meaningful way? My problem is that there is no background field for which I could take a mean field approximation, so the usual argument for phase transitions does not work. 

One thing that came to my mind is that the potential will have higher order corrections, so maybe one could ask which way these corrections work in the limit $\Lambda \to \infty$, where $\Lambda$ is a UV scale? I know the first order correction for small $\phi$ does actually contribute to the breaking rather than to restoration, but then that doesn't seem to be the right limit for the scattering. If you don't know the answer I'd also be grateful for a reference. (Please do not point me to references that are for in-medium effects, nuclear matter etc, as I have plenty of these and it's not addressing my problem.)
",WIMP,https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/1458,"First of all, the vev of $\phi$ scales like a positive power of $\mu$ which has the units of mass. So all the effects of the symmetry breaking scale like a positive power of the mass scale $\mu$. At energies $E$ satisfying $E\gg \mu$, i.e. much higher than $\mu$, the value of $\mu$ itself as well as vev and other things may simply be neglected relatively to $E$: all the corrections from the symmetry breaking go to zero, relatively speaking.

In the UV, i.e. at short distances, the dimensionless couplings (and interactions) such as $\lambda$ are much more important than the positive-mass-dimension dimensionful couplings such as $\mu$.

It's still true that the high-energy theory wasn't exactly symmetric in the treatment above; it was just approximately symmetric. However, in fact, sometimes it is exactly symmetric under the sign flip of $\phi$. That's because the value of $\mu$ runs, as in the renormalization group, and in many interesting theories, $\mu$ actually switches the sign at energies exceeding some critical energy scale $E_0$. So the high energy theory may have a single symmetry-preserving minimum of the potential and the symmetry breaking may be a result of the flow to low energies.

It's legitimate you want to know the higher-loop corrections to the Higgs potential but the subtlety you should appreciate is that all these calculations proceed relatively to some renormalization (mass) scale. If the scale is low, the behavior of the theory at much higher energies may only be deduced by the (inverted) RG flows. However, the deduction of the short-distance theory from its long-distance effective field theory approximation is never exact; it's the high-energy theory that is the legitimate starting point and the low-energy physics is its consequence.

What I understand is that the function of these relays is to delay the power output to the speakers when the device is turned on; to avoid any pop that may damage the former. It may also work when turning off the device, to avoid a thump... but of this I'm not sure. It's a cheap amp with cheap components.

Anyway, I received it and I noticed the left channel had a slight crackle when I turned the vol pot. It started right when I brought it out of 0 percent. But then it started crackling at around 20, then 50. I assumed it was rust or just the protective film flaking off of the cheap pot. So I sprayed it with some contact cleaner. After much caring for it, I've been able to reduce the crackling back to the original crackling I heard when I first turned the pot. If the amp has been off several hours, then it will slightly crackle when turning the pot up from 0. If I turn the pot a couple of times before turning on the device, then there's no audible issue.

All the time, this is only happening on the left channel. The right one is 100 percent clean. Other than this, the amp works as expected.

However, the other day the amp was off and I turned the pot and heard a slight crackle. I did notice, when I first received the amp through the mail, that if turned off and disconnected, the circuit still retains some power: first thing I did; right out of the box, I switched it on without connecting it and that intensely unnerving blue light the Lepai has around the vol control came on and fade off for a couple of seconds.

So I'm still trying to make sense of this issue. Trying to know if it's a faulty, old pot that's seeing its last days on the left channel and, therefore, I should just invest in a better pot and change it (because the rest of the amp modestly rocks) or if it's more complicated than that... perhaps an issue with the left channel relay, etc., and I'd better change the device entirely.

I probably am shooting way off the mark here but the first thing I thought when I heard that crackle when the amp was off was that perhaps the speaker-protection relay for the left channel is not working. But does a relay like this only work during on and off? Or does it still work throughout the process? And, if so, does it have the ability to ""filter"" these noises?

I'm thinking that even if some ""filter"" component (not necessarily the relay; if any of you knows the Lepai maybe you know if it has any filter incorporated) is not working like it should, that horrible noise must be coming from the vol pot. Am I wrong to think that? And to think that if the right channel is completely clean, then it must be an issue with the side of the pot that outputs to the left channel?

And finally, could this noise be digital and coming from deeper in the circuitry or does it necessarily have to be analog and coming from the pot?

I know this is a layered question but I've been looking for individual answers all over the net and can't find any, so I'm hoping somebody out there can help me out by guiding me into electronics though this, my first mod project.

Thanks a lot in advance!

",myradon,https://ux.stackexchange.com/users/41645,"Here are some suggestions:

The title/heading of the first menu layer, 'Search Nodes', is confusing. It might be better just to echo the link the user just clicked to slide out the menu i.e. ""Add Nodes"" 

It feels like you might be over-using checkboxes. The first example of this is next to 'Select previously bookmarked nodes'. A checkbox shouldn't be necessary if there's only one option, and even so, you complicate the interaction here. A checkbox should require one click to select, and another to confirm the choice, whereas a more appropriate element, like a button or a simple link, would only require one. 

Regarding your key question, again, I think your choice of repeating checkboxes and buttons will result in complicated interactions and cluttered UI. 

Here's an alternative solution for your consideration:



(1) An accordion-style menu, with disclosure triangles to reveal deeper options.

(2) Hovering over elements that can interacted with reveals a text link and action. In this case a branch node has already been added (hence the green color and checkmark) so the option is to Remove.

(3) This node has already been added.

(4) Hovering over this leaf node reveals the option to Add.

Of course there are are lots of stylistic variations to this, but it doesn't require multiple slide out menu trays, both leaf and branch nodes can be added/removed, and it doesn't require the repetition of check boxes and buttons.

The title/heading of the first menu layer, 'Search Nodes', is confusing. It might be better just to echo the link the user just clicked to slide out the menu i.e. ""Add Nodes"" 

It feels like you might be over-using checkboxes. The first example of this is next to 'Select previously bookmarked nodes'. A checkbox shouldn't be necessary if there's only one option, and even so, you complicate the interaction here. A checkbox should require one click to select, and another to confirm the choice, whereas a more appropriate element, like a button or a simple link, would only require one. 

Regarding your key question, again, I think your choice of repeating checkboxes and buttons will result in complicated interactions and cluttered UI. 

Here's an alternative solution for your consideration:



(1) An accordion-style menu, with disclosure triangles to reveal deeper options.

(2) Hovering over elements that can interacted with reveals a text link and action. In this case a branch node has already been added (hence the green color and checkmark) so the option is to Remove.

(3) This node has already been added.

(4) Hovering over this leaf node reveals the option to Add.

Of course there are are lots of stylistic variations to this, but it doesn't require multiple slide out menu trays, both leaf and branch nodes can be added/removed, and it doesn't require the repetition of check boxes and buttons.

2934,2934,4672,Quantum entanglement as practical method of superluminal communication,"As I understand it (from a lay physics perspective), quantum entanglement has been experimentally demonstrated - it is a reality. As I understand it, you can measure something like the spin of an electron and know that its entangled pair will, in that same instant, no matter where in the universe it is, have the opposite spin. 

This would not seem to have any utility as the foundation of a superluminal communications device. Is this true, or has it been established that is there some aspect of quantum entanglement that can ultimately lead to the development of such a device.

Using ssh-agent alone means that a new instance of ssh-agent needs to be created for every new terminal you open. keychain when initialized will ask for the passphrase for the private key(s) and store it. That way your private key is password protected but you won't have to enter your password over and over again.

The Arch wiki recommends initializing keychain from /etc/profile.d/ or your shell profile, such as .bash_profile or .bashrc. This has a disadvantage in that it intializes your keychain as soon as you open a terminal.

A more flexible approach is to combine keychain with a specific tmux session. So, in .bash_profile:

tsess=$(tmux ls 2>&1)

if [[ ""${tsess%%:*}"" = ""secured"" ]] && 
   [[ -f $HOME/.keychain/$HOSTNAME-sh ]]; then
    # start keychain

4978,4978,7928,how to calculate intersection time and place of multiple moving arcs,"I have rocks orbiting moons, moons orbiting planets, planets orbiting suns, and suns orbiting black holes, and the current system could have many many layers of orbitage.

the position of any object is a function of time and relative to the object it orbits.
(so far so good).

now I want to know for a given 2 objects(A,B), a start time and a speed, how can I work out the when and where to go. I can work out where A and B is given a time.
so i just need.

1: direction to travel in from A to B(remember B is moving(not in a straight line))
2: Time to get to b in a straight line. 

travel must be in a straight line with the shortest possible distance.

as an extension to this question, how will i know if its better to wait, EG is it faster to stay on object A and wait for a hour when the objects may be closer, than to set off from A to B at the start.

Cheers, it hurt my brain.
",user20733,https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/users/20733,"That's not so bad if you know the position of A and B at all times. Example:

A is at the origin. 
B is traveling around the origin at a distance of 1. (ie, it's orbit is the unit circle)
Let Y be the object leaving A. 

Let the speed of B be such that every second B crosses an axis. So the period of B is 4 seconds. Therefore the position of B at any given point in time is:
(cos(t * pi/2), sin(t * pi/2))

Let the speed of Y be such that every second Y can travel s distance. So after one second, if travelling along the positive x axis, Y will be s away from A. 
Therefore A creates another ""orbit"" to how far it can go every second based on:

sqrt(x^2+y^2) = s*t

Now you just need to determine what value of t is required to determine when these two things will intersect. 

This is a very simple case but it will more or less work for any 2D situation you would just obviously need to change the numbers around. Since you already have a function for B you can just replace mine with yours. The other equation is the same for every case. 

Now if you add another dimension and introduce physics modeling more of how our world works then this becomes nontrivial and could be very difficult and I'd just avoid it entirely. 

You'll know to wait if it takes longer to travel at the current position than it does at the time it takes to travel at a later position plus the wait time.

the position of any object is a function of time and relative to the object it orbits.
(so far so good).

now I want to know for a given 2 objects(A,B), a start time and a speed, how can I work out the when and where to go. I can work out where A and B is given a time.
so i just need.

1: direction to travel in from A to B(remember B is moving(not in a straight line))
2: Time to get to b in a straight line. 

travel must be in a straight line with the shortest possible distance.

as an extension to this question, how will i know if its better to wait, EG is it faster to stay on object A and wait for a hour when the objects may be closer, than to set off from A to B at the start.

Cheers, it hurt my brain.
","That's not so bad if you know the position of A and B at all times. Example:

A is at the origin. 
B is traveling around the origin at a distance of 1. (ie, it's orbit is the unit circle)
Let Y be the object leaving A. 

Let the speed of B be such that every second B crosses an axis. So the period of B is 4 seconds. Therefore the position of B at any given point in time is:
(cos(t * pi/2), sin(t * pi/2))

Let the speed of Y be such that every second Y can travel s distance. So after one second, if travelling along the positive x axis, Y will be s away from A. 
Therefore A creates another ""orbit"" to how far it can go every second based on:

sqrt(x^2+y^2) = s*t

Now you just need to determine what value of t is required to determine when these two things will intersect. 

This is a very simple case but it will more or less work for any 2D situation you would just obviously need to change the numbers around. Since you already have a function for B you can just replace mine with yours. The other equation is the same for every case.

I presented them with designs back in May and I'm still working through amends with them. They are making changes to everything and although I know amends are to be expected, it's really getting to be frustrating. I'm currently working every evening on the list of new amends they have. Tiny things like ""make this blue"" or ""change the width of this"" or ""make this gap smaller"".

I know amends need to be made and that's fine, but how do you handle when there are just too many? I've counted the comments on inVision and there have been 185 amends on 6 pages of a website design. 

Some of them change, and then change again, and then change again and again. For example they wanted to add a strapline, so I added it, adjusted all the menus to accomodate is across the 6 pages. Then they wanted to change the text, so I changed it and updated it across all 6 documents. Now that it's changed, they want to make the menu smaller so now I have to go back and change the menu again.

I quoted based on time I thought it would take to complete the designs with some time for amends but I've more than tripled the time. I haven't explained to them early enough in the process that amends beyond the normal would cost them more so I'm going to have to swallow the cost this time, but should I lay this out better with future clients?

How do you handle amends? Do you put an estimated time on them at the beginning, and then charge more if they go over this? Or do you do something different?

Ok i guess my first explanation was not good.
Retrieving through jquery a json and build a table is good, i could do that, but my request was more on the other part. 
I'm looking for a library to display the result in a special way. 
Let me explain. 
Json request 1 send : 
1;Tomato 2;Apple 3;Salad 4;Carot 

Json request 2 send : 
1;Tomato 3;Salad 4;Carot 5;Potatoes 

I would like the second row disapear with a effect (fadeOut) and the rows below move Up. For the row 5, i just want a new row appears with a fade in. 

Is that more clear ? 

Is there any livrary existing doing this ?

Thanks again

I'm doing it in PHP, but i hope to write all this in JS.

The user could just look the table and see the new rows appearing and the old rows deleting.

Any ideas or am i supposed to write it from scratch ?

4921,4921,7833,Home Network Router Used as Gateway Develops High Latency,"I have a WRT54G2 router (V1) with the most recent firmware that serves as the gateway between my Internet connection and my home network. Over the past few months, I've noticed that the router seems to consistently become unusable due to high latency when it runs for any period of time. The internet connection is working, but the latency is sometimes as high as 2000ms to ping Google or to run a test from Speedtest.net. When a computer is directly plugged into the cable modem provided by my ISP, the problems resolve.

Restarting the router proivdes a resolution of the problem, but over time the latency issues increase again until it needs to be restarted. Right now, I have it on a mechanical (plug) timer that restarts it every morning around 4AM, but this still doesn't seem to fix the overall issue; I've had to restart the router manually twice today. Before restart, my ping will be over 1000ms; afterward, it will drop back to 20-60ms.

Note that the download and upload speeds don't seem to be affected by this, just the latency itself.

The problem appears on both wireless and wired connections.

I'm not sure if this is a sign that our router is failing (it was purchased in 2009, so as far as consumer-grade solutions go, it's lasted a pretty decent span), or if there's some misconfiguration on my end, or if something with my ISP is making my router flip out. What can/should I do to fix this issue (please note that flashing the router with DD-WRT is not an option, this version generally sees decreased performance when DD-WRT is installed).

EDITED TO ADD: I have ruled out internal traffic causing the problem (I reviewed the log files for the router and tried to identify any unknown stuff, but it seems fine). I can't quite figure out exactly what causes the router to develop the issue, but once it does, I've noticed the following:


Extremely high latency (1000ms+) for pings from any computer inside the network to an outside destination
The router itself cannot ping or traceroute once it has started developing these high latency issues - if you use the router's PING feature, it returns all timeouts.
It does not seem to correlate with any specific type of traffic.

",TARehman,https://superuser.com/users/128601,"I would suggest doing first a factory reset by pressing and holding the reset button of the router for straight 30 seconds while powering on.

From Resetting Router after Firmware Upgrade says
(frankly it sounds like black magic, but some people claim it helps) :


  I was told by Linksys Support that I should Reset my router after
  updating the Firmware. I had never heard of this before. They gave me
  the procedures below :
  
  
  Press and hold the reset button of the router for straight 30 seconds while powered on, and then unplug the power cord for 10
  seconds and power up again.
  Connect a PC to the port 3 of the router then restart the PC. (This PC should be the one that can get online if directly connected to the
  modem). No connection yet to the modem, so only router and computer.
  Access the router's setup page then on that PC.
  To access the router's setup page, launch an Internet Explorer browser [or any browser you are using if you don't have IE]. On the

Over the past few months, I've noticed that the router seems to consistently become unusable due to high latency when it runs for any period of time. The internet connection is working, but the latency is sometimes as high as 2000ms to ping Google or to run a test from Speedtest.net. When a computer is directly plugged into the cable modem provided by my ISP, the problems resolve.

Restarting the router proivdes a resolution of the problem, but over time the latency issues increase again until it needs to be restarted. Right now, I have it on a mechanical (plug) timer that restarts it every morning around 4AM, but this still doesn't seem to fix the overall issue; I've had to restart the router manually twice today. Before restart, my ping will be over 1000ms; afterward, it will drop back to 20-60ms.

Note that the download and upload speeds don't seem to be affected by this, just the latency itself.

The problem appears on both wireless and wired connections.

I'm not sure if this is a sign that our router is failing (it was purchased in 2009, so as far as consumer-grade solutions go, it's lasted a pretty decent span), or if there's some misconfiguration on my end, or if something with my ISP is making my router flip out. What can/should I do to fix this issue (please note that flashing the router with DD-WRT is not an option, this version generally sees decreased performance when DD-WRT is installed).

EDITED TO ADD: I have ruled out internal traffic causing the problem (I reviewed the log files for the router and tried to identify any unknown stuff, but it seems fine). I can't quite figure out exactly what causes the router to develop the issue, but once it does, I've noticed the following:


Extremely high latency (1000ms+) for pings from any computer inside the network to an outside destination
The router itself cannot ping or traceroute once it has started developing these high latency issues - if you use the router's PING feature, it returns all timeouts.
It does not seem to correlate with any specific type of traffic.

","I would suggest doing first a factory reset by pressing and holding the reset button of the router for straight 30 seconds while powering on.

If that helps, everything is fine. But if it doesn't, then the prognosis is less than optimal.

Other people in your situation have given the following advice.

From Resetting Router after Firmware Upgrade says
(frankly it sounds like black magic, but some people claim it helps) :


  I was told by Linksys Support that I should Reset my router after
  updating the Firmware. I had never heard of this before. They gave me
  the procedures below :
  
  
  Press and hold the reset button of the router for straight 30 seconds while powered on, and then unplug the power cord for 10
  seconds and power up again.
  Connect a PC to the port 3 of the router then restart the PC. (This PC should be the one that can get online if directly connected to the
  modem). No connection yet to the modem, so only router and computer.
  Access the router's setup page then on that PC.
  To access the router's setup page, launch an Internet Explorer browser [or any browser you are using if you don't have IE]. On the
  address bar, please type 192.168.1.1 and then hit Enter/Return key. A
  log-in screen will appear.

",Vinayak,https://superuser.com/users/8477,"This problem is sometimes caused by the power configuration in Windows and sometimes by the battery reporting.

The easiest part to fix is the battery reporting. As long as the battery isn't damaged or ""worn out"" then a refresh of the battery may correct the problem. To refresh the battery turn off all power saving functions (especially standby/hibernate) and unplug the power. Let the battery drain - sometimes running a DVD can help speed this along. You want it to drain all the way down. This means making it wake up when it wants to force standby mode too. You will want to check your laptop manufacturer's website as some manufacturers have specific ways to help with battery refresh (and some have BIOS options to help with it). Once it dies completely, pull the battery out for 30 seconds and then replace and recharge the battery. This will force the battery to have fully available charging and will hopefully fix the reporting.

The other way is the rebuild. That is basically just wiping the drive and reinstalling Windows and all your applications. Normally, something like this isn't worth that effort but it also is a good idea to refresh your Windows installation every few years anyways. Don't forget to backup all your data first.

If neither of the above correct the issue then the only thing I can think of is the power management functions on the mainboard of the laptop may be damaged or malfunctioning.

The RB3 Keyboard is not a full-sized keyboard.  If we do use a full-sized midi keyboard in Pro mode, can we/do we have to use the entire keyboard, as it's played in the actual song, or can we/do we have to stick to two octaves (like the RB3 Keyboard)?
The RB3 Keyboard can also function as a five-button peripheral in non-Pro mode.  Can we do the same with a normal midi keyboard?
I've read that the RB3 keyboard has velocity-sensitive keys.  Does RB3 take this into effect?  Will I lose some functionality if my midi keyboard isn't velocity-sensitive?  Does the expressions bar also add functionality?

",BlueRaja - Danny Pflughoeft,https://gaming.stackexchange.com/users/2578,"My qualifications: I've used both the RB3 keyboard and a Roland D-50 MIDI Synth with a MIDI adapter.


If you use a full-sized midi keyboard in Pro mode, you do NOT use the entire keyboard. RB3 ignores notes played outside the two octave range of the RB3 keyboard. The pro keys chart displayed is the same no matter what kind of keyboard you are using (unlike the pro guitar charts which I understand are different depending on whether you use a 17-fret Mustang or a 22-fret Squier).
A normal midi keyboard can also function as a five-button peripheral in non-Pro mode. The only thing missing are the color-coded tags over the C-D-E-F-G keys that the RB3 keyboard has, but since you shouldn't be looking at your hands anyway, that shouldn't matter ;)
I don't think RB3 does anything with the velocity-sensitive keys, so you should not lose any functionality if your midi keyboard isn't velocity-sensitive. This is the only answer I'm not 100% positive on (my D-50 has velocity-sensitive keys), but I'm pretty sure.
The expression bar on the RB3 keyboard is like the whammy bar on the 5-button guitar controllers - it alters the sound of the notes and when used on a held note with overdrive, it will add to your overdrive bar. My D-50 has a pitch bend joystick that the MIDI adapter converts to the same function.

In particular,


The RB3 Keyboard is not a full-sized keyboard.  If we do use a full-sized midi keyboard in Pro mode, can we/do we have to use the entire keyboard, as it's played in the actual song, or can we/do we have to stick to two octaves (like the RB3 Keyboard)?
The RB3 Keyboard can also function as a five-button peripheral in non-Pro mode.  Can we do the same with a normal midi keyboard?
I've read that the RB3 keyboard has velocity-sensitive keys.  Does RB3 take this into effect?  Will I lose some functionality if my midi keyboard isn't velocity-sensitive?  Does the expressions bar also add functionality?

","My qualifications: I've used both the RB3 keyboard and a Roland D-50 MIDI Synth with a MIDI adapter.


If you use a full-sized midi keyboard in Pro mode, you do NOT use the entire keyboard. RB3 ignores notes played outside the two octave range of the RB3 keyboard. The pro keys chart displayed is the same no matter what kind of keyboard you are using (unlike the pro guitar charts which I understand are different depending on whether you use a 17-fret Mustang or a 22-fret Squier).
A normal midi keyboard can also function as a five-button peripheral in non-Pro mode. The only thing missing are the color-coded tags over the C-D-E-F-G keys that the RB3 keyboard has, but since you shouldn't be looking at your hands anyway, that shouldn't matter ;)

3304,3304,5270,Why is it best to use a prime number as a mod in a hashing function?,"If I have a list of key values from 1 to 100 and I want to organize them in an array of 11 buckets, I've been taught to form a mod function

For example my car up until recently was a Volvo 850, and the air conditioner didn't work in it; the cost of getting it fixed was significantly higher than other cars because of the way the A/C unit is installed in the car, so I went on without air conditioning. Another example is the service light in the car - while the car had a standard OBD-II port which could read error messages, it required a special Volvo reader to reset the service light.

And I know there is a wide range of problems a car can encounter, and many of them are universal - replacing tires, for (a bad) example.

4025,4025,6427,How to 'select' menu items that also link to deeper items?,"Currently I'm working on a navigation that doesn't take up too much screen real-estate. I came up with a pseudo off-canvas navigation with stacked menus.

A user can assign nodes to a product. This is the current state of the wireframe; user chose Add nodes. Now he want's to manually search for a specific node 1 (1. Browse Nodes in wireframe). The user now can select a node to add to product 2 or go 1 level deeper into the navigation 3. and 4.. If you click on a node-link the children off that node will slide-in and stack on top of the current menu. There is also a back option to parent (second wireframe).

I deliberately chose checkboxes, links and button as elements because that's their purpose; I wireframed there functionality not a design-solution. Normally I like selecting text/label also checks a checkbox, but now the label is a link too. A user could a) select that node to add to product, Or b) select node to navigate to children of that node.





I could argue if it makes sense that a node will act is a leaf and a branch. A don't have any real data about how customers assign nodes. I can't wait for this input. Currently functionality of the system is that a node could be a leaf and a branch. So asking real users is no option. Maybe in the future (months from now).

I came up with a pseudo off-canvas navigation with stacked menus.

A user can assign nodes to a product. This is the current state of the wireframe; user chose Add nodes. Now he want's to manually search for a specific node 1 (1. Browse Nodes in wireframe). The user now can select a node to add to product 2 or go 1 level deeper into the navigation 3. and 4.. If you click on a node-link the children off that node will slide-in and stack on top of the current menu. There is also a back option to parent (second wireframe).

I deliberately chose checkboxes, links and button as elements because that's their purpose; I wireframed there functionality not a design-solution. Normally I like selecting text/label also checks a checkbox, but now the label is a link too. A user could a) select that node to add to product, Or b) select node to navigate to children of that node.





I could argue if it makes sense that a node will act is a leaf and a branch. A don't have any real data about how customers assign nodes. I can't wait for this input. Currently functionality of the system is that a node could be a leaf and a branch. So asking real users is no option. Maybe in the future (months from now).

1001,1001,1579,Javascript pass onclick on child to parent,"I have div (.upload-drop-zone, yellow zone at screenshot) with another div (.dropzone-width, blue zone) inside.

There is a javascript onclick event attached to .upload-drop-zone (when I click on it, it shows file chooser dialog). Event attached by third-party plugin, so I have no access to function which be called.

The problem is that if I make click on .dropzone-width, click event did not pass to .upload-drop-zone so nothing happens instead of showing file chooser dialog. What can I do to fix it?

As you can see, there's a query parameter called sample of type string, and has an enum stating two possible values. In this case, the sample states the parameter is required, so the UI will not show an empty value as an option.

For a minimal working sample, try this:

    ""title"": ""title"",
    ""description"": ""descriptor"",
    ""version"": ""0.1""

2371,2371,3781,What are the benefits of owning a physical book?,"I have seen this question about updates of the D&amp;D 4th Edition books, and it got me thinking.
Since I got my Kindle I have not read a single paper novel; they have fewer drawbacks compared to digital copies than rpg rulebooks.


Dead-tree types have some benefits like looking good on a bookshelf, but any ebook reader weighs less with 100 novels than the usual hard-cover book. 
If you want to look for the damage of Ares Alpha, even with a half-decent tablet it takes less than 2 seconds.  
Digital copies do not get worn, they never get unwanted earmarks, but you can bookmark them.
Rulebooks do get updates, and unless you are willing to take a pen to your book, your hard copies will never contain them. The pdfs can be edited and resent to the buyers. 
Even better is the WotC approach with the DDI, you can look up any monster or item or (almost any) rule, in the most recent form, for 3 years at the cost of seven books. 


I think this is the way to go, even considering the horribly slow character builder. Although I must admit good illustration can help build the athmosphere.

So what am I missing? Why are people buying rpg rulebooks in paper format? Why are books even published, I do not need to know if feats are supposed to be on the right page and skills on the left, I just want a list of them, filterable any way I want. 

Is this just a necessary part of earning money? I understand that pdfs are copied illegally, but the Compendium is not. 
",András,https://rpg.stackexchange.com/users/9552,"I speak from experience, having DMed several D&amp;D internet-published adventures both by printing them (when I had a working printer on my old PC), by reading from published books and by reading from my laptop.

When playing at my laptop I had problems with the following:


showing images to players (easier with a tablet, or with a second linked screen)
I had to do all the searches on the SRD myself. Sometimes, other players brought their laptops too, but they started being more distracted since laptops can also be used for gaming.

",András,https://rpg.stackexchange.com/users/9552,"The benefits for owning a book are the same reasons we still have books, and why people still buy books instead of a Kindle or PDFs.

The advantage of books comes down to something basic: interacting with them is different to interacting with e-readers, and in the better for a lot of ways.

Let's consider the case of a single user, with access to a single e-reader or several books.

A key concept: Books are transparent tools for reading. E-readers are not.

One major difference between books and e-readers is the concept of a transparent tool. A transparent tool is one you can use without having to consciously think about operating the tool in order to use it, because it gets out of your way when you use it - it's something you can forget you're even using.

An easy comparison to demonstrate the difference is between a pen, which is a transparent tool, and a keyboard, which is not.

When you pick up a pen to write, you're not consciously thinking of the individual actions of moving the pen up, down, left, across, or so on. You can simply write, and your motions transfer effortlessly through the pen to paper. By contrast, to use a keyboard to write, you have to consciously operate the keys on the keyboard, mindfully reaching for the right keys to produce the results you want. Advanced users will become more at ease with the keyboard, but it will never be quite as transparent a tool to use as a pen, which requires little conscious operation beyond our natural movements.

Books and e-readers share an analogous situation: the e-reader is less transparent than a book, though technical aptitude and being used to the tool can help. E-readers are getting better at being transparent tools, but they're not there yet.

Of course, this sets aside the difficulty of actually writing well and legibly, but when considering the transparency of the tool, how neat your writing ends up looking or how fast you write isn't so much of an issue: whether the tool you're operating gets out of your way is the issue.

What does this mean for books?

In general, books just do what they do exceptionally well, and they do it transparently.

E-readers might let you do some similar things to what you can do with a book, but their equivalents are limited. The e-reader's equivalent action may not be as simple and effortless as performing the same action with a book, and you, the person trying to read their book, may be restricted in how you can perform that action, such that you cannot do it in a way that better suits you.


When placing bookmarks in books, you can use the method that works well for you or comes naturally to you. You can put coloured (or named) tabs in them, dogflap the pages, and so on. There are a dozen ways to mark pages. Despite being something small, this is one of the major differences, since for some, the e-reader's equivalent bookmark feature just doesn't work as well as methods such as coloured tabs poking out of the pages.
Flipping to those bookmarks is a completely natural and effortless action. You put your finger in beside your bookmark and open the book.
Browsing a book is easy, fast and flexible.

You can leap variable amounts of pages at a time.
For a book you're used to, leaping to an entire section can be as easy as flipping to a bookmark. E-readers offer something similar (if they have a table of contents), but it is not equivalent: you can't easily jump to the middle of a section, or so on. Muscle memory plays a helpful role here that it can't play with an e-reader.
RPG manuals will often mark the very edge of pages, so that you can see the different sections whilst the book is still closed. That guides leaping between sections, and e-readers don't generally offer an equivalent yet.
You can easily thumb between pages, keeping your fingers in past ones to go back and forth.

You can open multiple books at the same time, and have then all visible in parallel, with little loss of ability to read or operate any individual book, given you simply have enough space to lay them out or prop them up.
You can pass a book to a friend at the table, without losing the ability to read your other books. (This is hugely relevant to games like D&amp;D, where the GM can have their book open, and each of the players can have a book open with content pertinent to them. The cases may be equal when everyone at the table has an e-reader, though I'm not sure this is common.)
You can mark books: annotate them, write, draw, highlight, and so on. You can also leave post-its and other things in them. You can do similar things in e-readers, but they offer far more limited options, depending on the e-reader.
Books don't run out of batteries or need a cable.


... and a lot more.

You can do a lot of these things given the right e-reader, and e-readers are getting better at making these things easier to do. But e-readers won't let you do all of them, nor do it as easily.

Plus, books can be nicer for other reasons.

In some cases, the electronic version might be missing content.


In D&amp;D 4e, the Compendium offers no lore at all. The compendium will tell you almost nothing about how the Elemental Chaos and Astral Sea came to be, how the World was formed, the Dawn War that was fought, and the present states of the planes.
D&amp;D 3.5e's SRD contains very little lore, some names are different, and entire swathes of books are simply not released.


There's also the fact that some people just prefer books. The emotional factor isn't without relevance: to some such as myself, there's something pleasant about being able to pick up a hefty tome.

E-Readers offer little in comparison.

E-readers can give you one device instead of several heavy books, and offer some features that books don't - you can't ctrl+F a book - but it comes with trade-offs in ease of use in virtually every department.

E-readers are just... not yet as easy to interact with as books are.

I'm not all that good with Terminal and sorting out network issues using it but I've managed to scrape by so far.

Without using Internet Sharing (because controlling that via Terminal as per my question here doesn't actually seem to work in Yosemite) how can I share my internet connection from one interface (lets say en0) to another (again, lets say en1)?

I kind of understand that Internet Sharing creates a bridge (usually called bridge100) and then uses bootpd (I think) to establish a DHCP server and NAT to route all traffic from 192.168.2.xxx (which is the bridged network) through to your primary network.

How can I get the same result without using the Sharing pref pane?

372,372,587,Is Stormguard Warrior really that good?,"I have an idea of build centered around the Crusader class, with some possible dips in Warblade/Swordsage to take advantage of the goodies in other disciplines (such as Ironheart Surge or Time Stands Still).

The dip in the Warblade class brings me the opportunity to take the Stormguard Warrior tactical feat, and I have seen it recommended a number of times specifically for its Channel the Storm option (ToB, p.36):


  Channel the Storm: To use this option, you must choose to refrain from making one or more available attacks of opportunity against a single opponent. On your next turn, you gain a +4 bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls for each attack that you refrained from making against the same opponent. You gain this bonus only against an opponent that you refrained from making an attack of opportunity against in the previous round.


I am wondering if this feat is really that good. It seems that it requires a huge investment (in terms of feats) and it is unclear to me whether it really pays off.

The bonuses +4 AR/dmg per refrained AoO (which you have an infinite supply of (*)) do seem interesting, at first, however:


A prerequisite of Stormguard Warrior is Ironheart Aura, which in itself does not seem that interesting, especially for a Crusader (Thicket of Blade is not an Ironheart stance)
The bonuses gained can only be used against the opponent that generated them, and no other (it's a minor restriction, but worth keeping in mind)
An AoO is likely to do much more damage than 4, especially if using a two-handed weapon (even at level 1, we are looking at 1d10 + 6 ~= 11.5)


Thus, the two feats investment seems only worth it if one can generate more AoOs than one has available. In the recommendations I have seen, it is combined with Robilar's Gambit (-4 AR, 1 AoO per foe attack in melee) which itself requires Combat Reflexes. Dexterity is unlikely to be ignored (since it benefits Touch AC), and therefore we are looking at a minimum of 3 or 4 available AoOs per round...

Letting Combat Reflexes and Robilar's Gambit aside, is it really worth it investing in Ironheart Aura and Stormguard Warrior? Am I missing something?

(*) I have seen some debates where it is argued that refraining to take an AoO to fuel up Channel the Storm should use it up, which I ignore here. The feat is much worse in this case.
",Matthieu M.,https://rpg.stackexchange.com/users/1355,"In my opinion... 

The feat is often overrated.

What this feat can do is make the character extraordinarily good at protracted melee. The bonuses involved can get huge, no doubt about that.

But it's situational. In order to get the most out of the feat, you usually need to spend at least one round locked in a melee with something else.

The problem? A whole round is a really long time.

Let's consider the good options given by the feat. (No one cares about Fight the Horde.)


Channel the Storm requires you to refrain from making an AoO against a particular opponent. Not taking an AoO usually means you
allowed your opponent to pull off a risky move, like ignoring you in

This doesn't mean the feat is bad, or that you shouldn't build around it. But the feat has some glaring tactical weaknesses that make it inapplicable in many situations. Fortunately, Stormguard Warriors are generally full initiators, and can use other maneuvers when the feat won't work.

The dip in the Warblade class brings me the opportunity to take the Stormguard Warrior tactical feat, and I have seen it recommended a number of times specifically for its Channel the Storm option (ToB, p.36):


  Channel the Storm: To use this option, you must choose to refrain from making one or more available attacks of opportunity against a single opponent. On your next turn, you gain a +4 bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls for each attack that you refrained from making against the same opponent. You gain this bonus only against an opponent that you refrained from making an attack of opportunity against in the previous round.


I am wondering if this feat is really that good. It seems that it requires a huge investment (in terms of feats) and it is unclear to me whether it really pays off.

The bonuses +4 AR/dmg per refrained AoO (which you have an infinite supply of (*)) do seem interesting, at first, however:


A prerequisite of Stormguard Warrior is Ironheart Aura, which in itself does not seem that interesting, especially for a Crusader (Thicket of Blade is not an Ironheart stance)
The bonuses gained can only be used against the opponent that generated them, and no other (it's a minor restriction, but worth keeping in mind)
An AoO is likely to do much more damage than 4, especially if using a two-handed weapon (even at level 1, we are looking at 1d10 + 6 ~= 11.5)


Thus, the two feats investment seems only worth it if one can generate more AoOs than one has available. In the recommendations I have seen, it is combined with Robilar's Gambit (-4 AR, 1 AoO per foe attack in melee) which itself requires Combat Reflexes. Dexterity is unlikely to be ignored (since it benefits Touch AC), and therefore we are looking at a minimum of 3 or 4 available AoOs per round...

Letting Combat Reflexes and Robilar's Gambit aside, is it really worth it investing in Ironheart Aura and Stormguard Warrior? Am I missing something?

(*) I have seen some debates where it is argued that refraining to take an AoO to fuel up Channel the Storm should use it up, which I ignore here. The feat is much worse in this case.
","In my opinion... 

The feat is often overrated.

What this feat can do is make the character extraordinarily good at protracted melee. The bonuses involved can get huge, no doubt about that.

But it's situational. In order to get the most out of the feat, you usually need to spend at least one round locked in a melee with something else.

The problem? A whole round is a really long time.

Let's consider the good options given by the feat. (No one cares about Fight the Horde.)


Channel the Storm requires you to refrain from making an AoO against a particular opponent. Not taking an AoO usually means you
allowed your opponent to pull off a risky move, like ignoring you in
favour of beating on a squishier party member, or charging through
your reach. This is bad. Granted, Robilar's Gambit and/or Karmic
Strike can help generate AoOs, but remember what has to happen for
those to trigger? You need to get attacked. The more attacks you
take, the greater the certainty of your retaliation being enough to
finish your opponent - but what if your opponent manages to make sure
there is no next round? 
Combat Rythm is an even more extreme example of ""betting on the second round"". First, you need to effectively do nothing for a round. Then your opponent gets to act. If you are still alive, and still fighting the same opponent, that opponent is in trouble. But you ceded a round spent in melee, and again, that can come with the price tag of getting your character's skull opened.

The downside to this is that whenever I change the smart object, I need to repeat this process.

Is there a way to apply a smart object as a mask to a layer, and keep it as a smart object?
",JCBK,https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/users/4089,"Yes, there's quite a few ways to achieve this.

If you want to paste objects from Illustrator as Smart Objects, then you can use is a a clipping mask for layers above. To clip a layer above the Smart Object, option-click between the layers. You should end up with something like this.



That's not how I'd do it though. The simpler option is just to have a vector mask on your bitmap layer (or vector layer, gradient, pattern or text). To do this, paste your path(s) from Illustrator as a Shape Object (very important!). You'll end up with something like this.



That's a shape layer in Photoshop CS6 (CS5 and earlier versions are similar).

If you'd like to use that path as a mask on another layer, select it using the Path Selection tool (A), then press command-C to copy it.

Then go to the bitmap layer you'd like to apply the vector mask to, and press command-V to paste.



Then choose Layer > Vector Mask > Current Path to use the path as the mask (this was slightly easier in CS5, as it could be all done by option-dragging the vector mask from one layer to another).

You'll end up with a bitmap layer with a vector mask.



Why is this better? It's one layer, not two. Your vector mask is still editable. You can also now clip other layers to this layer.

There's a lot of reasons why I don't like using Smart Objects. In most cases, Shape layers are better, unless you need the Smart Object to contain more than one colour or gradient itself, which is pretty rare for me.

There's a few other ways to mask, including using group masks. It really depends on what's important though.

This works if I don't use the .htaccess rule but I need it for routing. If I have that rule I get internal server errors everytime I access site1.com (I assume that it's a conflict between cpanel rules and .htaccess).

How can I modify the rule so that it only affects maindomain and not subdomains? I am assuming that by doing this there would be no conflict and my problem would be solved.

I am really bad at .htaccess and regex but I am willing to learn if needed. I would still appreciate if you could point me to the right direction. (both in the idea and in good websites that can help me understanding this)

$$\frac{1}{9600} \approx 104 {\mu}s$$
You need 104 microseconds for each bit period.  Start and stop bits are also 104 microseconds. Now, you will probably have to subtract processing time from the delay.  You can find this by studying the processor's instruction timing and writing in assembly, or cheat and just measure on an oscilloscope.

That's what I'm sent.

}


And I'm getting the numbers 7, 14, 15,17. I think the error is in the synchronization of start bit.
","If you want to transmit at 9600 baud, your delays are wrong.
$$\frac{1}{9600} \approx 104 {\mu}s$$
You need 104 microseconds for each bit period.  Start and stop bits are also 104 microseconds. Now, you will probably have to subtract processing time from the delay.  You can find this by studying the processor's instruction timing and writing in assembly, or cheat and just measure on an oscilloscope.

But for sure _delay_us(2); and _delay_us(156); are wrong.

I've installed a cruise control kit in my car, and I want to use a set of Honda steering wheel controls instead of the stock controls from the kit.  The cruise kit controls are expecting 12 volts, but I'm not comfortable running any more than 5 volts through the small steering wheel wires next to the airbag wiring.  I'd prefer even less, like 2-3 volts.

So I need to build a switching circuit that will provide the 12 volt signals to the cruise kit.  I was thinking of keeping it solid-state, since I don't know of any relays that will switch on 2-3 volts.  However, if there's a good reason to use relays then I can.

Is that more clear ? 

Is there any livrary existing doing this ?

6014,6014,9542,Please advise on check gauges light on and battery gauge reads zero,"Saw this thread while investigating what sounds like the same problem with my jeep. The check gauge light came on and my battery gauge bottomed out. But  weird thing is, it ran fine. I drove it a few miles home, and turned it off, then started it again and the same thing happened real quick. What should I approach first since it's running ok. I do have some rust damage underneath. This jeep came from Detroit so its been in salt and snow for a long time, I just bought it and this is the first time its done anything weird. I could have a corroded connection or should I go right at Alternator being the culprit.
Thanks in advance for any advice,this is my first Jeep
",jay Anderson,https://mechanics.stackexchange.com/users/4734,"Yes, your alternator is the culprit as the engine is running on battery power. Before you purchase a new one, though, take it to your local Autozone, Pepboys, Checker, or the like and have them test it. They will do it for free. I take it since you didn't say the steering became hard, that the serpentine belt is still running correctly. If it was difficult to steer, this would be the issue.

Based on photos I've seen as reference on this forum I'm afraid the damage is more extreme than superficial. Supposedly it happened from one fall.  The bottom side has a hole that's been repaired and the face/soundboard has two cracks below the bridge on either side. It's a TW15H Tanglewood Ill 

Here's the story:
I'm trying to buy my husband a guitar for Christmas. He played in college but has only picked up a guitar a handful of times since we've met. He's 34 now and we have a soon-to-be 2yo son who is captivated by the guitar (and another son due in 2mos). My husband has been hinting on wanting to start playing again so I thought it would be the perfect Christmas gift. 

I don't have much to spend and really don't want an all laminate plastic piece of junk. I don't know much about guitars but I recognize when I hear sound quality I love - rich, full bodied, well balanced sound that resonates with a person.  Not that tinny twang I hear from some guitars without that depth of sound. 

I was at a local music shop this morning that pointed me to a damaged TW15H Tanglewood Ill 
He told me it's solid wood construction with ebony and bone. Sounds beautiful. I believe it was a dreadnought. (Sorry if I sound naive...picture a hugely pregnant lady shopping in a guitar shop with a toddler. I assure you we look as naive as I might sound).  The problem is that the TW15H Tanglewood Ill is damaged. It's been dropped. The face is cracked in 2 places and there was a hole at the bottom. 

If I can post photos here I will. 

The owner has repaired the damage. Says it was his own guitar and he loved it but a friend dropped it soon after it's purchase and despite being repaired he gets upset whenever he sees it and no longer wants it around to remind him. The damage is quite visible but it sounds lovely. My question is how much damage is too much?  Will it hold a tuning etc? He told me it's a 3000k guitar and is asking $375 for it. I only saved $200 to buy a guitar which I realize is laughable for a decent one. I'm thinking of putting the rest on a credit card if I can find out it's worth it. Can anyone help advise me here?  The shop says he'll back the guitar for a year. 

The other option he suggested was a Sammick - Greg Bennett (which I've never heard of) for $250

How things should really work

There's a famous concept in programming called MVC, which stands for Model-View-Controller. The controller is irrelevant now, so I'll omit it, only discussing model and views:



There's always one model which represents the data or what needs to be persisted (stored). Then there are views - what the user see. Sometimes a user sees two views of the same data (think of a list of bars next to pins on a map), sometimes many users see each a view of the same model.

We assume that a user can edit the view, and the role of the MVC framework is ensure that once 1 view is updated all other views update as well.

With websites, there are quite a lot of layers between the model (which is stored and served by the server) and the view (which the user sees on their client browser), so it took us quite a few decades that get this update mechanism working on the web.

Early internet technology was based on the pull model - users had to perform an action, which would send a request to the server that holds the data and the server would respond with the data. So to get updates, users had to press or do something.

Nowadays, the need for a push model (the server pushes data the the clients, without them asking for it) is in high demand, and modern web technologies accommodate such need. One example is you may be looking at a question on this site, and suddenly get a notification that someone left a comment to one of your answers to another question - the notification just shows, even if you were just looking.

My point is, that with correct implementation using modern technology, whenever item X has changed, anyone watching it should be notified. One common problem in UX is that people got so used to dated technology that they take bad usability and how things work (or how things don't work) as a norm.

Should you show it to the users.

I honestly can't think of a single argument why not.

The most obvious reason to show it to users is that status of the system should be obvious to users. If something changes, and it doesn't reflect on the screen somehow, than the system status is no longer communicated to the user correctly.

Just consider someone spending 10 minutes to edit a form, only to get a message it was already deleted by the time they finish. It's a bit like the following phone conversation at the top of this post.

To summarise - you should always let the user know that the version they are looking at is no longer up-to-date. How you handle the various scenario (edited or deleted, for example) has to do with the business logic and the system in question.

To give one example, it happens sometimes that whilst you answer a question on this site, the original or the moderators delete it. Immediately you get a notification saying ""This post has been delete, no answers will be accepted"" and the ""Answer"" button becomes disabled. As no one has an idea what you'd like to do next, they keep you on the screen, but you can't do much on it other than going elsewhere.

Not all systems work that way. In many systems deleting an entity doesn't actually deletes it - it simply marks it as deleted and doesn't show anywhere; this open doors to alternative handling option.

I was hoping that it was just a matter of adding a ""--localInputDir"" directive to the command line would fix things. However, this seems unrelated to where the Tomcat server is trying to upload.

641,641,1013,Tool for automatically generating and laying out an entity relationship diagram?,"I've seen a lot of tools which can reverse engineer an ERD from an existing database, but I haven't been able to find one which is capable of automatically laying out the diagram in a reasonable way. Most of them just plop all the entities down on top of each other and call it a day. Some make an attempt at organizing the entities, but they don't do a very good job of it. 

Is there any tool out there that will reverse engineer the structure of an existing database, and then automatically lay it out in a way which is easy to understand and reveals the organization of the database? If I were to make such a tool, I'd have it minimize the length of lines connecting entities, minimize the number of lines which cross each other, and make groups of related entities stand out from each other. I'd also try to deduce which tables are lookup tables, which ones are mana-to-many intermediate tables, etc and lay out the entities such that these roles are obvious to a person looking at the diagram. 

I don't exactly have the funding to make the above, but I do have some funding to buy a tool like that if it's good. 

Edit: I should mention that I'm trying to diagram a database with 100+ tables, so I'd like to automate as much of it as possible.

619,619,974,Would this work? Using a computer SMPS as a DC-DC converter,"I have this crazy idea of using a computer SMPS with active PFC boost to take high voltage DC battery banks (144V+) and drop it down to 3.3V, 5V and 12V.

Here's my thinking: the power supply internally rectifies the AC to DC, and the PFC boost should then boost the 144V to an acceptable 350V-400V for the power supply. The 144V input is okay for it because it falls in the 100VAC range, and most are rated down to 85VAC if not lower. 

I'm not looking for a guaranteed solution - it's a one-off problem I'm trying to solve, but I think it could be a cheap and viable solution.

Areas of Concern

I noticed in my query that if I try to execute the SQL with:

$stmt-&gt;execute( array(':start'=&gt;$pages-&gt;limit_start,':end'=&gt;$pages-&gt;limit_end) );


I get an error unless I also use $conn-&gt;setAttribute(PDO::ATTR_EMULATE_PREPARES, FALSE);. However I can get around that if I use bindParam instead:

$stmt-&gt;bindParam(':start', $pages-&gt;limit_start, PDO::PARAM_INT);
$stmt-&gt;bindParam(':end', $pages-&gt;limit_end, PDO::PARAM_INT);
$stmt-&gt;execute();


Should I be using $conn-&gt;setAttribute(PDO::ATTR_EMULATE_PREPARES, FALSE); or the separate bindParam calls?bindParam seems like a decent solution, whereas using ATTR_EMULATE_PREPARESseems a little hacky.

Within the class, am I setting the visibility (public, private, protected) of my parameters and methods properly?

If you see anything that jumps out at you like ""what in the world was he thinking?"", you can assume that I was dealing with something I hadn't done before. Any tips or suggestions overall would be appreciated.
",j08691,https://codereview.stackexchange.com/users/10068,"You can use commas to separate similarly scoped class properties. This will make your code a little easier to read and make it easier to modify.

public
    $items_per_page,
    $total_items,
    $current_page,
    //etc...
    $get_page
;


You probably shouldn't rely on GET variables. Passing these values in as parameters allows for more extensibility. That being said, I think your constructor might be doing a tad too much already and you might consider using some individual setters. Look into the Single Responsibility Principle. This goes along with what Fleshgrinder said about using more methods.

Please, always use braces on your statements, especially on long complex ones. PHP, by default, does not support true braceless syntax, otherwise you would be able to neglect them everywhere. Doing so makes your code much more legible. The advantages of neglecting them, if there even are any, are negligible.

if(!is_numeric($this-&gt;items_per_page) OR $this-&gt;items_per_page &lt;= 0) $this-&gt;items_per_page = $this-&gt;ipp_array[0];

//compared to
if(!is_numeric($this-&gt;items_per_page) OR $this-&gt;items_per_page &lt;= 0) {
    $this-&gt;items_per_page = $this-&gt;ipp_array[0];
}


The same applies for foreach loops. In addition, ternary statements are nifty, but should only be used when doing so does not detract from legibility. In the following code I have no idea what's going on.

foreach($this-&gt;ipp_array as $ipp_opt) $items .= ($ipp_opt == $this-&gt;items_per_page) ? ""&lt;option selected value=\""$ipp_opt\""&gt;$ipp_opt&lt;/option&gt;\n"":""&lt;option value=\""$ipp_opt\""&gt;$ipp_opt&lt;/option&gt;\n"";

//compared to
foreach($this-&gt;ipp_array as $ipp_opt) {
    if($ipp_opt == $this-&gt;items_per_page) {
        $items .= ""&lt;option selected value=\""$ipp_opt\""&gt;$ipp_opt&lt;/option&gt;\n"";
    } else {
        $items .= ""&lt;option value=\""$ipp_opt\""&gt;$ipp_opt&lt;/option&gt;\n"";
    }
}


Additionally, the above could be modified to reduce repetition like so:

$selected = $ipp_opt == $this-&gt;items_per_page ? 'selected' : '';
$items .= ""&lt;option $selected value=\""$ipp_opt\""&gt;$ipp_opt&lt;/option&gt;\n"";


In response to some of Fleshgrinder's points:

Use proper cameCase notation for property and method names

This is a stylistic choice, though one I agree with. This is entirely up to you.

Keep everything protected unless you have a good reason to keep it private or expose it with public

Good advice, but to expand upon this, an element only has to be public if it should be accessible or modifiable outside of its current scope (the current class).

Use single or double quotes throughout your code, but don’t mix it (consistency)

Again, another stylistic point... sort of... Single quotes are string literals. This means that PHP interprets the contents between single quotes as being nothing more than a string. Double quotes are processed by PHP for evaluation, thus you are able to put PHP variables directly in the string and have them be properly escaped. As such, double quotes are ever-so-slightly slower, but it is negligible. Consistency is important, but don't let it stop you from using single/double quotes as they were meant to be used.

Enclose your variables in {} if you embed them in strings

This is only necessary if the variable you are including is complex. For example:

$string = ""This is $simple, and this is {$complex[ 'elem' ]}"";


Sorry this is kind of rushed, I might come back and add to this later. Hope this helps!

You probably shouldn't rely on GET variables. Passing these values in as parameters allows for more extensibility. That being said, I think your constructor might be doing a tad too much already and you might consider using some individual setters. Look into the Single Responsibility Principle. This goes along with what Fleshgrinder said about using more methods.

Please, always use braces on your statements, especially on long complex ones. PHP, by default, does not support true braceless syntax, otherwise you would be able to neglect them everywhere. Doing so makes your code much more legible. The advantages of neglecting them, if there even are any, are negligible.

if(!is_numeric($this-&gt;items_per_page) OR $this-&gt;items_per_page &lt;= 0) $this-&gt;items_per_page = $this-&gt;ipp_array[0];

//compared to
if(!is_numeric($this-&gt;items_per_page) OR $this-&gt;items_per_page &lt;= 0) {
    $this-&gt;items_per_page = $this-&gt;ipp_array[0];
}


The same applies for foreach loops. In addition, ternary statements are nifty, but should only be used when doing so does not detract from legibility. In the following code I have no idea what's going on.

foreach($this-&gt;ipp_array as $ipp_opt) $items .= ($ipp_opt == $this-&gt;items_per_page) ? ""&lt;option selected value=\""$ipp_opt\""&gt;$ipp_opt&lt;/option&gt;\n"":""&lt;option value=\""$ipp_opt\""&gt;$ipp_opt&lt;/option&gt;\n"";

//compared to
foreach($this-&gt;ipp_array as $ipp_opt) {
    if($ipp_opt == $this-&gt;items_per_page) {
        $items .= ""&lt;option selected value=\""$ipp_opt\""&gt;$ipp_opt&lt;/option&gt;\n"";
    } else {
        $items .= ""&lt;option value=\""$ipp_opt\""&gt;$ipp_opt&lt;/option&gt;\n"";
    }
}


Additionally, the above could be modified to reduce repetition like so:

$selected = $ipp_opt == $this-&gt;items_per_page ? 'selected' : '';
$items .= ""&lt;option $selected value=\""$ipp_opt\""&gt;$ipp_opt&lt;/option&gt;\n"";


In response to some of Fleshgrinder's points:

Use proper cameCase notation for property and method names

This is a stylistic choice, though one I agree with. This is entirely up to you.

Keep everything protected unless you have a good reason to keep it private or expose it with public

Good advice, but to expand upon this, an element only has to be public if it should be accessible or modifiable outside of its current scope (the current class).

Use single or double quotes throughout your code, but don’t mix it (consistency)

Again, another stylistic point... sort of... Single quotes are string literals. This means that PHP interprets the contents between single quotes as being nothing more than a string. Double quotes are processed by PHP for evaluation, thus you are able to put PHP variables directly in the string and have them be properly escaped. As such, double quotes are ever-so-slightly slower, but it is negligible. Consistency is important, but don't let it stop you from using single/double quotes as they were meant to be used.

Enclose your variables in {} if you embed them in strings

This is only necessary if the variable you are including is complex. For example:

$string = ""This is $simple, and this is {$complex[ 'elem' ]}"";


Sorry this is kind of rushed, I might come back and add to this later. Hope this helps!

4923,4923,7837,Combined ADC scaling and offset with variable input voltage ranges,"I am trying to create a circuit which will allow me to scale and offset a voltage (be it AC or DC) to within the range of the Arduino ADC.

The voltage could be anything between + and - 250V, but I also need to have good sensitivity over lower voltage ranges too.

To this end I am looking at a circuit whereby you can vary the voltage range that it expects the input to be and amplify/attenuate it accordingly.  How I will be making the decision and setting the different gains is for another topic for now.  I am only interested in the scaling and offsetting at the moment.

So far I have come up with this circuit:



Which appears to do just what I want for the +/- 250V range.  I don't know how ""safe"" this circuit is, and if I am endangering any of the components with the 250V or not.  The graphs at the bottom are (left to right) the input voltage, the power consumption of the bottom 10M resistor, the voltage across the 100M resistor (which is simulating the Arduino ADC input) and the power consumption of the upper 10M resistor.

Now, if I drop the input voltage to just +/- 2.5V and tweak the op-amp feedback resistor accordingly, for some reason the offset voltage the op-amp is adding jumps right up.  I don't know for sure if this is the fault of the simulator I am using, or if it is really what will happen, as I haven't yet breadboarded this circuit (I guess that's the next stage).

This is the output from the 2.5V version:



You can see how the offset has jumped up and the output is clipping massively.

If I drop the lower 10K resistor to the virtual ground offset voltage divider to just 3.3K it compensates, but that's not nice - I would like to just vary the one resistor.  

The op-amp is (will be) a 5V single supply rail-to-rail I/O one.

The two diodes are to protect the input of the op-amp against over voltage - I don't know if this circuit strictly needs them, but I guess it doesn't hurt to have them there.

Also, I don't know if the resistor values are quite what I want - I chose them to keep the power consumption right down and the impedance right up.  I don't want them to impact the frequency response of the circuit more than I can help - the input waveform could be anything from DC up to around 500KHz or so, and I need that reproducing at the ADC end as faithfully as I can.  (I know the Arduino can only really sample at lower speeds than that, but the Arduino is just for experimenting - the final system will use a dsPIC with 1.1Msps ADC).

So, what can I do to A) get a more stable offset, B) allow the varying of the input sensitivity without nuking either the op-amp or the ADC, and C) make the circuit safe to connect to, for example, a European mains voltage?
",Majenko,https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/4245,"Several comments:

Add component designators to your schematic.  It is difficult to talk about the circuit otherwise.

You appear to be a little confused about resistor dividers.  You have two resistor on the input, but only one is doing anything.  The resistor to ground is just a load on the input but otherwise has no bearing on your circuit.  It sortof looks like the two input resistors (component designators would definitely help) are meant to be a divider that didn't get hooked up right.

Yes, you can use opamps for gains below 1, but you might as well use resistor dividers instead.  Also keep in mind that at best opamps are specified as stable for unity gain magnitude, but not below.  You would have to add your own compensation for that.

Three resistors, one from the input voltage, one to ground, and one to the supply can be adjusted such that the input voltage range maps reasonably well to the 0-5V A/D range without any active parts.  You can then use the opamp as a voltage buffer because the output of the resistor divider may not have low enough impedance.

Instead of changing gains, I would just have a few different gain setups driving different A/D pins.  As long as the voltages are properly clipped, they won't hurt being out of range.  The full 220V signal may be out of range for the high sensitivity A/D input, so you ignore that and only use the low sensitivity reading.  When the signal level is low, the high sensitivity input won't be clipped, so you can use that.  Nothing needs to change except in the firmware, which decides which input to use for the particular magnitude of input signal.

500 kHz is a lot for the high value resistors you show.  Those should work at 50 Hz, but at 1000 times higher frequency the parasitic capacitance will be significant compared to those resistances.



Added:

If whatever software you are using doesn't allow for component designators, use something that does.  At least use that when drawing the schematic for other people to see.  Simulators are overrated anyway.  They have their uses, but all too often they seem to make the user forget he has a brain of his own.  For a trivial circuit like yours, it would take longer to enter it into a simulator than to simply think it out.

You can do a lot with a three-resistor divider as I mentioned above:



This can't always exactly fill the 0-Vdd output range with the input signal.  But even when it can't, there is usually a good enough solution.  Generally the more you need to attenuate, the easier it is to get the output into the desired range.

To analyze this circuit, note that by themselves R2 and R3 form a voltage divider of Vdd.  This can be thought of as a voltage between Vdd and ground with a specific impedance (see Thevanin):



Where R4 = R2 // R3.  How you can see we have a simple two-resistor voltage divider.  The divider gain is R4/(R1+R4) and the output impedance is R1//R4.  From 7th grade math we know that whatever this circuit does to the input voltage can be described by:

Vout = Vin(M) + B

You can find M and B easily enough from the above equation from any two different points.  In your case, Vdd = 5V, so you want the output to be symmetric around half that, or 2.5V.  So at Vin=0 you want Vout=2.5.  Two other obvious known points are the peaks of the input waveform.  Let's pick the negative one, so at Vin=-250 Vout=0.  Now M and B can be easily solved.

If you want to find a exact solution, you can write the equations for M and B in terms of R1, R4, and V1.  As long as V1 is more than 0 and less than Vdd, a exact solution is possible.  From the simplified second schematic, it should be obvious that:

M = R4/(R1 + R4)
  B = V1 * R1 / (R1 + R4)

Note that this system is underconstrained as there are 3 unknowns and only 2 equations.  The extra degree of freedom can be expressed as the final output impedance of Vout, which is R1//R4.

You have enough here to write all the equations and solve them.  That's no longer electronics but grade school arithmetic, so that's your job.  Instead I'll take a less exact but more intuitive hack at it here.

Let's say you want the output impedance to not exceed 10 k&Omega;.  We know the attenuation will be high, so R1 will be significantly larger than R4.  For simplicity, let's simply make R4 = 10 k&Omega;.  That will make the output impedance a little less than 10 k&Omega;.  You have a 500V input range and want a 5V output range, so the divider gain should be 1/100.  Again to make things simple, we'll just make R1 = 100*R4 = 1M&Omega;.  That actually results in a gain of 1/101, but a little margin is a good idea and you'd have to get 1% resistors as it is to guarantee the gain isn't more than 1/100.  So far we have:

R1 = 1 M&Omega;
  R4 = 10 k&Omega;

At this high attenuation ratio, B pretty much equals V1, so let's just make V1 = 2.5V.  Now we still need to get R2 and R3 from R4.  From the values above, each should be 20 k&Omega;.  However, we're making some approximations and it's good to allow for a little slop anyway, so I'd start with the next lower common value of 18 k&Omega;.

Now you need to plug all that in and compute the output voltage at the peaks of the input voltage, taking into account inaccuracies in the resistors.  I'll leave that as a exercise to you, but the values above are either good enough or pretty close for a starting point.

So, for instance, does it not infer that if, say, Sodium Chloride is placed into water, and the attraction of the h-bonds in water cause the NaCl to essentially break apart into ions, that the inherent attractions between cations and anions in an ionic compound are weaker than the attraction force of the h-bond water molecule?

It helps if you have two objects with different sounds, so you can hear differences if practicing strokes between the two, eg like a paradiddle etc. However for practicing the mechanics of drumming (with hands- not feet), you don't need any particular sound; you can just have a couple of pads or a snare and a hi-hat or something. This is fine for practicing the rudiments.

On a snare, you can get loads of different sounds by hitting it in different places on the skin (try right near the edge vs. right in the middle, and all the way along) and sidestick on the snare rim of course.

3241,3241,5166,Applying OO patterns and principles to plugin development,"I'm busy writing my first plugin, using PHP 5.3.5. I come from a C# environment, and I must say I'm more than happy with the level of support for good, solid OOP techniques in PHP. However, I'm a little uncertain how to structure a plugin using classes. I have a plugin class that takes care of hook registration in its constructor, and some worker classes like a mail queue and mailer, but I have one or two non-class scripts, mostly for forms, that I don't quite know how to neatly fit into classes. What resources are their I can consult for guidance on this aspect of my OO plugin?

The plugin is for mass mailing, i.e. mailing to all subscribers, on schedule etc. It registers a custom post type for mail templates, with add new and edit capabilities, and it adds its own menu to the bottom of the admin menu, currently with two submenu pages: 'settings' and 'send mail'. It also adds an 'opt out' option to the user profile page, but that's quite tidy and easy to include the main plugin class.
",ProfK,https://wordpress.stackexchange.com/users/7268,"
  I have one or two non-class scripts, mostly for forms, that I don't quite know how to neatly fit into classes.


Split your project into multiple classes.  Keep your worker classes as instantiable objects (typical OOP patterns) and put your non-class scripts into a class of their own as static scripts.

I often use static PHP classes to namespace my code this way.  Example:

class My_Object {
    public $variable = 1;

    public function __construct() {
        // Constructor

The difference between these two classes is that you instantiate one (My_Object) and use it as an object.  The other is basically a namespace wrapper for a function that doesn't belong in an object but that also doesn't belong in the global namespace.

Let's say you started with just a regular Run_Script() method in your plugin ... then later down the road, another developer adds a Run_Script() method to another plugin.  You now have a name conflict.  Keeping your standalone functions inside a static class helps prevent this.

Just call Helper::Run_Script() to access it.


  What resources are there I can consult for guidance on this aspect of my OO plugin?


Basically, look at what others have done.  There are quite a few quality plugins out there that follow this kind of a pattern.  So take a look at how others have tackled the problem and learn from their example.

GitHub is a great place to look at code.  Most of my plugins are up there, so you can browse through code files to view the structure without needing to download them and install them.

I come from a C ා environment, I must say I am very satisfied with the support level of good and reliable OOP technology in PHP. However, I'm a bit unsure about how to use classes to construct plug-ins. I have a plug-in class responsible for hook registration in its constructor, and some working classes, such as mail queue and mail program, but I have one or two non class scripts, which are mainly used for forms, and I don't know how to skillfully adapt to classes. What are their resources? Can I refer to my OO plug-in's guidance on this?","
  I have one or two non-class scripts, mostly for forms, that I don't quite know how to neatly fit into classes.


Split your project into multiple classes.  Keep your worker classes as instantiable objects (typical OOP patterns) and put your non-class scripts into a class of their own as static scripts.

I often use static PHP classes to namespace my code this way.  Example:

class My_Object {
    public $variable = 1;

    public function __construct() {
        // Constructor
    }

    public function do_something() {
        // Misc. method for the object
        $this-&gt;variable++;
    }
}

static class Helper {
    public static function Run_Script() {
        // Function that does something and doesn't belong in a class
    }
}


The difference between these two classes is that you instantiate one (My_Object) and use it as an object.  The other is basically a namespace wrapper for a function that doesn't belong in an object but that also doesn't belong in the global namespace.

4255,4255,6783,Tool for automatically generating and laying out an entity relationship diagram?,"I've seen a lot of tools which can reverse engineer an ERD from an existing database, but I haven't been able to find one which is capable of automatically laying out the diagram in a reasonable way.

Is there any tool out there that will reverse engineer the structure of an existing database, and then automatically lay it out in a way which is easy to understand and reveals the organization of the database? If I were to make such a tool, I'd have it minimize the length of lines connecting entities, minimize the number of lines which cross each other, and make groups of related entities stand out from each other. I'd also try to deduce which tables are lookup tables, which ones are mana-to-many intermediate tables, etc and lay out the entities such that these roles are obvious to a person looking at the diagram.

2665,2665,4244,Quantum Mechanical Meaning of Atomic Orbitals,"According to quantum mechanics, for multi-electron atoms, a single electron around the nuclei can be in the state of linear combination of different eigen energy states. In that case, even the energy of the electron is not one of the eigen energies.

In chemistry, we often say that an electron is in an orbital (such as 1s, 2s), another electron is in another orbital, etc. How does it make sense if an electron is in a linear combination state?
",NGY,https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/4314,"While it's possible for the atom to be in a superposition on energy states, the superposition collapses to an eigenstate as soon as we observe it. Therefore every atom we observe will have a distinct electronic configuration.

Incidentally, note that for a multi electron atom the assignment of electrons to the atomic orbitals 1s, 2s, etc, is an approximation.

Therefore every atom we observe will have a distinct electronic configuration.

Incidentally, note that for a multi electron atom the assignment of electrons to the atomic orbitals 1s, 2s, etc, is an approximation.

111,111,180,Would this work? Using a computer SMPS as a DC-DC converter,"I have this crazy idea of using a computer SMPS with active PFC boost to take high voltage DC battery banks (144V+) and drop it down to 3.3V, 5V and 12V.

Here's my thinking: the power supply internally rectifies the AC to DC, and the PFC boost should then boost the 144V to an acceptable 350V-400V for the power supply. The 144V input is okay for it because it falls in the 100VAC range, and most are rated down to 85VAC if not lower. 

I'm not looking for a guaranteed solution - it's a one-off problem I'm trying to solve, but I think it could be a cheap and viable solution.
",Thomas O,https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/1225,"Someone once claimed that it was possible to supply 170V DC directly to a computer power supply (switch-mode) and it would work as normal.

Otherwise if it's isolated the DC won't do anything and the power supply won't work. 

But if it does work then you have nothing to worry about.  Fully-rectified AC is about 170VDC with ripple.  It won't hurt to remove the ripple and the power supply will work as normal.  I'm fairly sure that 144VDC would be sufficient as well, but the power supply might have to work a bit harder.

4885,4885,7775,Do parallel realities take precedence over time travel in the Star Trek Universe?,"The 2009 Star Trek movie and its pending sequels are based on the concept of parallel realities introduced in the season 7 Next Generation episode ""Parallels,"" laying out that anything that could happen has happened in a parallel universe. The Enterprise and its crew from the most recent movie are part of a parallel reality that was created when Nero and Spock came back through the black hole created by red matter in an attempt to stem the destruction caused by a supernova. For clarification, this crew will be referred to as Chris Pine's and the older movies as Shatner's.

In the movie Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home, a probe shows up in 2286 at Earth looking for whales that had disappeared decades before. Shatner's crew is faced with travelling back in time to try and retrieve two humpback whales in order to stop the cylindrical probe from destroying Earth. They do this using a Klingon Bird-of-Prey that was stolen in the previous movie, going back to 1986 to find the whales.

I think it's safe to assume that in Pine's reality, the probe will probably make an appearance again, since the destruction of whales probably wouldn't change. So Pine's crew will also be faced with the dilemma of travelling back to find humpbacks (although probably without using a Klingon ship).

If Pine's crew also goes back to the same instant in 1986 as Shatner's crew to find whales (which seems highly improbable given that hitting the same time period as Shatner would be ridiculous), would they run into Shatner's crew or would it create another parallel reality stemming from 1986? If it created another reality, that seems like some kind of backwards causality since the event that would be causing the new stem wouldn't be the instant before the ships arrived but an event in the future.

1461,1461,2300,jQuery iScroll 4 - Issues loading AJAX content to sliding panel,"I am using a jQuery plugin called iScroll 4 (iScroll4 Docs), which allows me to touch, swipe, pinch and scroll a scrolling panel. The contents of this scrolling panel are loaded via AJAX and include a horizontal list of images.

This all works fine when first loaded but if I upload some more images and have AJAX update the panel, the iScroll plugin doesn't work anymore!

This is my code... and this works:

// the JS ////////////////////////

&lt;script src=""js/iscroll-lite.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script&gt;

// start iScroll

var myScroll;
function loaded() {
    setTimeout(function () {
        myScroll = new iScroll('scroll-uploader-photos');
    }, 100);
}
window.addEventListener('load', loaded, false);

// load images to panel for first time

load_previous_uploads(&lt;%=Session(""article_id"")%&gt;);

// load images function

function load_previous_uploads(article_id) {
    if (article_id != """") {
        var data_str = ""article_id=""+article_id
        $.ajax({
        type : 'GET',
        data : data_str,
        url : 'ajax/get-uploader-photos.asp',
        dataType : 'html',
        success : function(data) {
            if (data != """") {
                $("".upload_result"").html(data);
            }
        }
        });
    }
}
&lt;/script&gt;

// the html //////////////////

&lt;div class=""upload_result""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

// the ajax content from external ASP page (get-uploader-photos.asp)

&lt;div class=""scroll-uploader-photos""&gt;
    &lt;img&gt;&lt;img&gt;&lt;img&gt;&lt;img&gt;&lt;img&gt;&lt;img&gt;&lt;img&gt;&lt;img&gt;&lt;img&gt;&lt;img&gt;&lt;img&gt;&lt;img&gt;&lt;img&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


If I now go and upload some more images, and on success I run the function load_previous_uploads(), the iScroll plugin then does not work as the sliding panel has been updated and is starting to bug me as to why I cannot fix it. After it stops working, I can simply refresh the page and it all works again, with the new images.

For a better example of what I have:



If anybody can see what is wrong and/or can see a fix, please let me know - I would be soooo grateful!

 MY ATTEMPT **

I thought by calling the iScroll function **loaded()** right after AJAX updates the image panel after an upload, it might fix the problem... but it didn't!!

The contents of this scrolling panel are loaded via AJAX and include a horizontal list of images.

This all works fine when first loaded but if I upload some more images and have AJAX update the panel, the iScroll plugin doesn't work anymore!

This is my code... and this works:

// the JS ////////////////////////

&lt;script&gt;

// start iScroll

var myScroll;

    if (article_id != """") {
        var data_str = ""article_id=""+article_id
        $.ajax({
        type : 'GET',
        data : data_str,
        url : 'ajax/get-uploader-photos.asp',

            }
        }
        });
    }
}
&lt;/script&gt;

// the html //////////////////

&lt;div class=""upload_result""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

// the ajax content from external ASP page (get-uploader-photos.asp)

&lt;div class=""scroll-uploader-photos""&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


If I now go and upload some more images, and on success I run the function load_previous_uploads(), the iScroll plugin then does not work as the sliding panel has been updated and is starting to bug me as to why I cannot fix it. After it stops working, I can simply refresh the page and it all works again, with the new images.

For a better example of what I have:



If anybody can see what is wrong and/or can see a fix, please let me know - I would be soooo grateful!

 MY ATTEMPT **

I thought by calling the iScroll function **loaded()** right after AJAX updates the image panel after an upload, it might fix the problem... but it didn't!!
","Have you tried the refresh method of iScroll?

From the docs

ajax('page.php', onCompletion);

function onCompletion () {
    // Here modify the DOM in any way, eg: by adding LIs to the scroller UL

    setTimeout(function () {
        myScroll.refresh();
    }, 0);

2108,2108,3356,Why does my switch need to be wired in this fashion?,"Today was my first foray into electronics since high school, in the form of some simple Raspberry Pi experiments. I managed to get a circuit working where a switch controlled an LED with a potentiometer to control the brightness of the LED.

However, I am confused by the wiring of the switch. Firstly, here's a photo of my amazing work:



NOTE: the black lead on the potentiometer is not connected to anything (hard to tell in the photo). Also, I realised afterwards that I could have just inserted the potentiometer into the breadboard rather than soldering wires to it. Noob mistake (one of many).

Here's an attempt at a schematic (also probably wrong because I don't know what I'm doing):

As you can see, I used a PiFace, which comes with the four switches located at the left and towards the bottom of the photo. It is the wiring of this switch that befuddles me. Since each switch has two terminals, I was expecting one terminal to act as an input and the other as an output. That is, I just feed my circuit through those two terminals and job done. But that didn't work.

I managed to find this image online:



This is what prompted me to guess the configuration below, which works. However, I don't understand why it works. Nor do I understand why there are two terminals for each switch if only one seems to be used. I suspect the clue is embedded within the text in the above image:


  The four switches, numbered S1 to S4 are connected in parallel to the
  first four (0-3) inputs

If you can use a midi controller instead of the keyboard, you should be able to map certain keys to the five buttons. 
The velocity-sensitivity is probably intended to counter the fact that they're using very 'cheap' keys, which lack the natural resistance of a decent keyboard. My guess would be that you won't notice any difference in game.

Observe that $\textrm{tr}(Q) = n - p$ (the trace is invariant under cyclic permutation) and that $Q'=Q=Q^2$. The eigenvalues of $Q$ are therefore $0$ and $1$ (some details below).

Since $\hat{\epsilon} \sim N(0, \sigma^2 Q)$, we have $K \sim N(0, \sigma^2 \Delta)$ and therefore $K_{n-p+1}=\ldots=K_n=0$. Thus

4870,4870,7747,Bad practice to pass IQueryable to ViewModel,"I might be misunderstanding something about ViewModels here (I'm new to them), but is it a bad practice to pass a static Get method an IQueryable?

For example:

using (var db = something.Invoke()) {

    //do something with data
}

class MyViewModel {

It would just seem really redundant to have to map my database to a more generic data structure and then pass that to my ViewModel to do another mapping (like database -> List -> ViewModel).

I will describe dangerous situations and encounters in fiction but the mechanics make it too easy for my players to succeed.

For instance no matter how big I describe the Troll, if the fighter of the party charges him and swing his sword, roll+2 for Hack and slash, he'll easily hit the troll. Almost 40% chance to hit without consequences.
",MrJinPengyou,https://rpg.stackexchange.com/users/4000,"The narrative at hand is a perfect reason to make things difficult for the player.

He may want to hack and slash at the troll but he doesn't decide on what move his intended action corresponds to. Feel free to challenge his intent by clarifying details and then asking.

I can imagine a conversation going like:

— I hack and slash at the troll!
— Cool, how do you do it?
— I just swing my sword to chop his head off!
— Well, he's swinging a huge tree trunk around, how do you intend to get close enough to bring your steel toohpick in striking range?
— Well, I try to look for an opening and dive in.
— Looks like discern realities, please roll+wis.
— That's an 8, I get to ask one question, ok, what should I be on the lookout for?
— His swing has a semi-random looking pattern but you can guess it out.
— So I can just run in with perfect timing to avoid his swing.
— Cool, that looks like defy danger with roll+int to outsmart the troll.
— What? Not dex? Why?
— Because you can see that even with speed and reflexes, you'd eventually get hit by the trunk unless you figure out his rythym.
— Well, here goes… a 4, ouch!
— There's no way you're getting in by timing it, sooner or later that trunk will push your skull into your ribcage unless you keep your distance. That's what you have been doing instinctively anyway without realizing that you have been cornered, with nowhere to retreat anymore. The troll seizes the opportunity to deliver its skull-to-ribcage promise by swinging the trunk straight down on you. What do you do?
— Whoa, I duck and tumble inside his guard.
— Sure, defy danger with roll+dex…
— 9 this time. What now?
— Well, you're obviously not going to pull that off with a sword in your hand. Either let go of it or feel the impact of the trunk on your back, your call.
— I need the HP, so ok, I let go of the sword and tumble.
— Cool. You're now inside the troll's guard without your sword. The troll grins to show you his rotting teeth, drops the trunk which just falls on your sword, and lunges to grab you by your throat. What do you do?

Here, the GM diverts the player's action so that he's on the defensive rather than the offensive he intends. The player had to go through three potential points of failure and he still couldn't take a real swing at the troll. 

That, in my opinion, is what makes this a difficult adversary. Not how improbable your chance of succeeding is, but how many other things you have to go through before you can take a shot at your quarry.

This is one of the Myths that Paul Randal clearly debunks in his famous series - A SQL Server DBA myth a day


  On 64-bit systems (2005+): AWE is not required (and in fact enabling it does nothing).


Also refer to Fun with Locked Pages, AWE, Task Manager, and the Working Set… by Bob Ward :


  The AWE APIs for 32bit and 64bit SQL Server systems are used for different purposes. In 32bit it is really to extend memory access beyond 4Gb or to enable the AWE feature. For 64bit systems, it is to possibly gain performance and to “lock pages” for the buffer pool.


and 


  In fact, the code for SQL Server for 64bit systems ignores awe enabled sp_configure option. It is a “no-op” for 64bit SQL Server systems.

This is one of the Myths that Paul Randal clearly debunks in his famous series - A SQL Server DBA myth a day


  On 64-bit systems (2005+): AWE is not required (and in fact enabling it does nothing).


Also refer to Fun with Locked Pages, AWE, Task Manager, and the Working Set… by Bob Ward :


  The AWE APIs for 32bit and 64bit SQL Server systems are used for different purposes. In 32bit it is really to extend memory access beyond 4Gb or to enable the AWE feature. For 64bit systems, it is to possibly gain performance and to “lock pages” for the buffer pool.


and 


  In fact, the code for SQL Server for 64bit systems ignores awe enabled sp_configure option. It is a “no-op” for 64bit SQL Server systems.

To your first question, yes, you can mix memory sizes.  

To your second question, 4GB of matching memory will be faster than unmatched memory, but 8GB of unmatched memory will be faster than 4GB of matched memory. At some point you stop getting gains from more memory, but that depends on what you're doing.

1859,1859,2954,Custom key binding/mapping,"Currently I am starting to develop my first serious game. Before the games are all training, and learning how to do things in a good way. Unfortunatly, I've missed a big part in my preparation: Key binding. 

Currently I am trying to figure out how I can bind keys to action for each scene in my game.
For example:
If the user presses the JumpButton during the GameScene, the avatar should jump, but pressing the same key in a MenuScene, the currently selected menuitem should be activated.

Which key the JumpButton is, should the user be able to set. But the behaviour should be always the same. 

Here is my first, and I think very naviive idea:

I am having a HashMap with HashMap where Key is the key on the Keyboard and ACTION is just an enumValue.
When I am in the scene, and a button is pressed, I will take that button, and ask the HashMap which action is bind to the button. using a switch I can now determine what to do.
In my mind there is a little gap.. I have ONE action per Button, maybe named: ACTION_PLAYER_JUMP as an enumValue, and when I am in a GameScene this is okay, but in a MenuScene this ACTION_PLAYER_JUMP is not a very nice name... I do not want to have all bindings two times, just for better names.

Can someone tell me how to fix this, or a better system? I am sure there is a much better system for handling those bindings.

I want to use both of jQuery Validation Engine plugin and ajax response to return result. For this I use same jQuery('#messageSendButton').click() function in every case.

&lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;
                jQuery('#messageSendButton').click(function () {

                    var url = '@Url.Action(""SendQuickMessage"", ""Home"")';

                            }
                            else {
                                alert(""Error occured!"");
                            }

And, to validate form:

  &lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;
                jQuery(document).ready(function () {
                    jQuery('#quickMessageForm').validationEngine('init');
                    jQuery('#messageSendButton').click(function () {
                        jQuery('#quickMessageForm .loading').animate({ opacity: 1 }, 250);
                        if (jQuery('#quickMessageForm').validationEngine('validate')) {

                                Message: jQuery('#message').val(),
                                formname: 'messageForm',
                                formtype: 'messageF'
                            }, function () {
                                jQuery('#quickMessageForm .loading').hide();
                            });

                            return false;
                        } else {
                         jQuery('#quickMessageForm .loading').animate({ opacity: 0 }, 250);
                            return false;
                        }
                    });
                });
            &lt;/script&gt;


Separately, they both works alone, but together, firstly ajax function works, second validation works. it is not right.. How can I combine those in one? Firstly to validate form, then get ajax response.

Edit:

Here is form:

 &lt;form action=""#"" method=""post"" id=""quickMessageForm""&gt;
            &lt;div class=""form_info cmsms_input""&gt;
                &lt;label&gt;Email&lt;span class=""color_3""&gt; *&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/label&gt;
                @Html.TextBoxFor(model =&gt; model.Email, new { name = ""email"", id = ""email"", tabidex = 1, @class = ""validate[required,custom[email]]"" })
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class=""form_info cmsms_textarea""&gt;
                &lt;label&gt;Message&lt;span class=""color_3""&gt; *&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/label&gt;
                @Html.TextAreaFor(model =&gt; model.Message, new { id = ""messageText"", name = ""messageText"", tabindex = 2, @class = ""validate[required,minSize[10]]"" })
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class=""loading""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div&gt;
                &lt;input type=""submit"" name=""messageSendButton"" id=""messageSendButton"" value=""Send"" class=""button_small"" tabindex=""3"" /&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/form&gt;

4293,4293,6843,Combined ADC scaling and offset with variable input voltage ranges,"I am trying to create a circuit which will allow me to scale and offset a voltage (be it AC or DC) to within the range of the Arduino ADC.

The voltage could be anything between + and - 250V, but I also need to have good sensitivity over lower voltage ranges too.

To this end I am looking at a circuit whereby you can vary the voltage range that it expects the input to be and amplify/attenuate it accordingly.  How I will be making the decision and setting the different gains is for another topic for now.  I am only interested in the scaling and offsetting at the moment.

So far I have come up with this circuit:



Which appears to do just what I want for the +/- 250V range.  I don't know how ""safe"" this circuit is, and if I am endangering any of the components with the 250V or not.  The graphs at the bottom are (left to right) the input voltage, the power consumption of the bottom 10M resistor, the voltage across the 100M resistor (which is simulating the Arduino ADC input) and the power consumption of the upper 10M resistor.

Now, if I drop the input voltage to just +/- 2.5V and tweak the op-amp feedback resistor accordingly, for some reason the offset voltage the op-amp is adding jumps right up.  I don't know for sure if this is the fault of the simulator I am using, or if it is really what will happen, as I haven't yet breadboarded this circuit (I guess that's the next stage).

This is the output from the 2.5V version:



You can see how the offset has jumped up and the output is clipping massively.

If I drop the lower 10K resistor to the virtual ground offset voltage divider to just 3.3K it compensates, but that's not nice - I would like to just vary the one resistor.  

The op-amp is (will be) a 5V single supply rail-to-rail I/O one.

The two diodes are to protect the input of the op-amp against over voltage - I don't know if this circuit strictly needs them, but I guess it doesn't hurt to have them there.

Also, I don't know if the resistor values are quite what I want - I chose them to keep the power consumption right down and the impedance right up.  I don't want them to impact the frequency response of the circuit more than I can help - the input waveform could be anything from DC up to around 500KHz or so, and I need that reproducing at the ADC end as faithfully as I can.  (I know the Arduino can only really sample at lower speeds than that, but the Arduino is just for experimenting - the final system will use a dsPIC with 1.1Msps ADC).

So, what can I do to A) get a more stable offset, B) allow the varying of the input sensitivity without nuking either the op-amp or the ADC, and C) make the circuit safe to connect to, for example, a European mains voltage?
",Majenko,https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/4245,"The offset voltage is increasing as you have increased the gain and you have the non inverting input set above ""mid point"".   

With the top circuit there is actually attenuation, so the opamp doesn't have to drive it's output very hard to keep the inverting input at 2.5V.  

When you increase Rf to 10Meg, the output has to drive it's output to the necessary voltage to  match the input current and keep the inverting input at 2.5V.
For example, with 0V on the input, then the output must swing to 5V to keep the inverting input at 2.5V. Basically if you have Rin the same as Rf, and you know the input voltage (0V) the midpoint voltage at -IN (2.5V) then it's easy to work out what the top of the voltage divider (opamp OUT) should be (5V)
If your signal is swinging around a different point (0v) than the opamp midpoint (2.5V) then when you change the gain you will also alter the effect the DC offset (e.g. 2.5V) has.

EDIT - If you are happy to use as many opamps as necessary, then the easiest way would be to have a fixed input voltage divider followed by a non inverting unity gain buffer and then a few opamps with different gains. You can also use a few ""taps"" on the input voltage divider then use e.g. a couple of OptoMOS to route the signal appropriately (these are useful for AC/DC setting to bypass the capacitor too)
As Olin mentions any parasitic capacitance will create a low pass filter which may have quite a low cutoff, so you have to be aware of this when designing for your highest frequencies a couple of pF will make a big difference with 10 Megaohms (I would stick to &lt;= 1 Megaohm) The input impedance will also need to be very high (>100 Megaohm) to prevent attenuation so a FET input opamp would be best.
As far as dual rails go they can make life easier here if you need DC coupling, a charge pump can be used (the rails don't need to be symmetrical) followed by some filtering, or of course a switching regulator. You have the signal swinging round 0V up to the (opamp before the) ADC then level shift.

I would look at a a few input stages for oscilloscopes, as this seems to have much the same requirements. There are plenty out there, check some of the service manuals for commercial scopes out, and also stuff like Bitscope and DSO Nano/Quad. 

Probably wouldn't hurt to pick up a good book on opamps too if you haven't got one - a decent freely available one is Opamps for Everyone.
IIRC it goes into great detail on the simultaneous equations involved in calculating the straight line equation constants (as Olin goes into a little with the resistor divider) so if you want to keep a single supply Olin's advice combined with the first couple of chapters would be good reading.
Personally I would go with the dual rail as it makes things like maintaining a constant DC -> AC input impedance easier and prevents issues with midpoint bias when you switch from 1x to 10x probe setting, effectively altering R1 in Olin's example.

The goal of 500kHz should make things a bit easier as you don't have to worry as much about high speed problems. You may want to have a filter rolling off a fair bit before 500kHz though for anti-aliasing purposes - I'd say around 350kHz to keep filtering reasonably easy.
I assume you'll want quite a few division settings, (down to say 100mV/div) and also you want to divide the screen into 10. I'll also assume you will be using a probe with a 10x setting.
So on the maximum division setting: 
500/10x probe = 50V, divided by 1:10 input voltage divider = 5V. 
For a typical scope input impedance of 1 Megaohm, this would equate to 900k and 100k for the divider.
For the lowest range of 100mV/div, you would need a gain of 50 from input to ADC. 1V input divided by 10 = 100mV, times 50 equals 5V.
Splitting the gain over a couple of opamps will make the other gain settings easier, and maintain a decent bandwidth (higher gain = lower opamp bandwidth)
Say one opamp with e.g. selectable gains of (something like) 1, 2 and 5 feeding another with gains of 1, 2 and 10 (using standard CMOS multiplexers like 74HC4051/2) gives you a few options from 1 to 50.
Then a final level shifting ADC buffer opamp, and you can do it all with a quad (FET input) opamp package.

  let $\alpha$ be a infinite cardinal , show that:
  $$\alpha=\aleph_{0}\alpha$$
  where $\aleph_{0}$ is the cardinality of the natural numbers is denoted aleph-null


this equation is from a book,and I can't prove it,and the author say this is important equation,and can't prove it.Thank you for you help
",china math,https://math.stackexchange.com/users/94077,"Recall that $\aleph_\alpha$ is the cardinality of the $\alpha$-th [infinite] initial ordinal, denoted by $\omega_\alpha$.

For this proof you will need an extra fact:


  If $\alpha$ is an uncountable ordinal then $|\alpha|=|\{\delta&lt;\alpha\mid\delta\text{ is a limit ordinal}\}|$.


If $\alpha=0$ then you can prove directly that $\aleph_0\cdot\aleph_0=\aleph_0$ by using a pairing function.

Now define an equivalence relation on the ordinals below $\omega_\alpha$, $\xi\sim\zeta$ if there are only finitely many ordinals between $\xi$ and $\zeta$. I will leave you to verify that this is an equivalence relation. $\omega_\alpha$ is well-ordered, each equivalence class has a least element, and it is a limit ordinal, or zero. Otherwise its predecessor is in the same equivalence class, which is a contradiction to the minimality. And of course, different limit ordinals cannot be in the same equivalence class, because they have infinitely many ordinals between them.

So we have $\aleph_\alpha$ equivalence classes; and $\aleph_0$ points in each of the classes. Therefore $|\omega_\delta|=\aleph_\alpha\cdot\aleph_0$. Note that the axiom of choice wasn't used here, because we have a canonical ordering of each equivalence class.

Now. How to prove the fact? Usually the proof goes through defining the above equivalence relation and using the fact that $\aleph_0\cdot\aleph_\alpha=\aleph_\alpha$. So we can't really use that here. But we can use transfinite induction. It suffices to prove this for the initial ordinals, because every limit ordinal which is not an initial ordinal is either countable, or equipotent with its initial ordinal.

Suppose that for $\alpha$ it is true that for all $\beta&lt;\alpha$, either $\beta=0$ or there are $\aleph_\beta$ limit ordinals below $\omega_\beta$. Then it holds that $\aleph_0\cdot\aleph_\beta=\aleph_\beta$ for those $\beta$'s.

By contradiction there are less than $\aleph_\alpha$ limit ordinals below $\omega_\alpha$, then there is some $\beta&lt;\alpha$ such that $|\{\delta&lt;\omega_\alpha\mid\delta\text{ is a limit ordinal}\}|=\aleph_\beta$. Consider the above equivalence relation defined on $\omega_\alpha$, then it only has $\aleph_\beta$ equivalence classes, and therefore $\aleph_\beta=\aleph_\beta\cdot\aleph_0=\aleph_\alpha$, but $\beta&lt;\alpha$ and that is impossible. $\square$

So at the end we have to resort to transfinite recursion if we want to use the structure of ordinals, but it's just a scary term, it's not that scary once you understand this extremely useful technique.



Now, using the axiom of choice if $\alpha$ is an infinite cardinal then it is an $\aleph$ number. However, some people define ""cardinal"" as an $\aleph$ number to begin with, in which case you don't use the axiom of choice.

In the general form, where cardinal need not be an $\aleph$ number, it is consistent with the failure of the axiom of choice that there are cardinals which do not satisfy this property.

5640,5640,8942,What are the benefits of owning a physical book?,"I have seen this question about updates of the D&amp;D 4th Edition books, and it got me thinking.
Since I got my Kindle I have not read a single paper novel; they have fewer drawbacks compared to digital copies than rpg rulebooks.


Dead-tree types have some benefits like looking good on a bookshelf, but any ebook reader weighs less with 100 novels than the usual hard-cover book. 
If you want to look for the damage of Ares Alpha, even with a half-decent tablet it takes less than 2 seconds.  
Digital copies do not get worn, they never get unwanted earmarks, but you can bookmark them.
Rulebooks do get updates, and unless you are willing to take a pen to your book, your hard copies will never contain them. The pdfs can be edited and resent to the buyers. 
Even better is the WotC approach with the DDI, you can look up any monster or item or (almost any) rule, in the most recent form, for 3 years at the cost of seven books. 


I think this is the way to go, even considering the horribly slow character builder. Although I must admit good illustration can help build the athmosphere.

So what am I missing? Why are people buying rpg rulebooks in paper format? Why are books even published, I do not need to know if feats are supposed to be on the right page and skills on the left, I just want a list of them, filterable any way I want. 

Is this just a necessary part of earning money? I understand that pdfs are copied illegally, but the Compendium is not.

Portability: The only reason I bring a laptop or e-reader to games is usually because the game is when I'm playing at the home of someone else or a neutral location of some sort.  Call me lazy, but I'm less than enthused to carry my entire collection which with my AD&amp;D stuff, is easily a dozen each hardback and soft cover books.  Having digital copies saves me some potentially considerable effort to keep everything I need with me.  Every game I have been a part of for any serious duration usually has several books and everyone needs only one or two pages from the extras but the whole book has to come along.
Indexing:  There are precious few books that have a pervasive index.  Some are simply maddening because they will place an entry as a subsection of another instead of being its own listing.  Searchable text has been a life saving feature that helps me even facilitate answers for this site because I can keep jabbing the ""find next"" button to make sure there isn't some hidden passage of errata in a different section of the book.  I can go directly to what I want.  Not only this, but I have a dyslexic player who uses the e-book to read aloud to him and that's the only way he learns the rules without a walkthrough mid-game.
Errata: Some releases are digital only nowadays.  Books can always be scanned for free, but new digital content costs to be printed (even if minutely... at first) and having a file is a resource that can be given back.  Unless you choose to print on both sides (or use the back of an already printed page) that page is spent.  Maybe line a birdcage with it but that's about it once you're done.


Spined Books


Redundancy:  Murphy is my worst player.  He corrupts files, drops books and readers alike, summons unholy deluges that permeate the stoutest bag as I dart from vehicle to building.  A book can take a fair amount of damage before becoming useless.  Even if it gets wet or torn, the other pages are still viable.  A backup of files is cheap and easy but a backup of devices is frustratingly costly.  Even if one book becomes totally useless, the rest should still be in good condition anyway.
Psychology: I can't agree more with PlasmaHH when it was stated that genuine books imply something about the DM/GM/ST.  They usually mean business unless it's that rich friend who can piddle away money for books like they're tissue boxes.  Every game I've been in where the DM is serious about their world, the content, and grasp of the rules they never subsumed on PDFs alone (although certainly had them where possible).  It's kind of like the illusion a gym membership provides where by virtue of having spent good money on something, you want full value of the resource and hardback books are the most costly.  Other than systems that went out of print before I was aware of them, everything I run I keep at least a core book hard copy for communal use if nothing else.
Distribution: Probably beating a dead horse with many of the answers explaining how using a genuine book means you can give media away without losing the entire medium to read it.  However with some companies being notorious for bad binding, I've seen books split into binder volumes and individual pages given tot he players who need them and right back in the pot when they're done.  No entry cost of time to find the right file, download, change storage device/upload to cloud, download to new device, open, find again for a one time use.  Just give the page back when you're done.
Wear &amp; Tear Can be Your Friend: Believe it or not, the more a book is used, the more useful it gets in my experience.  Several of my books have been opened and creased to specific pages I use so often that with a blind grab at the right depth of the volume I can open to the exact page I want to something I may not have thought to leave a bookmark on (digitally or literally).  Typically any system's combat turn order, the start of its magic and skill sections become permanently held for intuitive indexing.


Equality/Trading Off


Annotation: Familiarity breeds ease of use.  I can place sticky notes or add comments with equal proficiency, as well as remember the page number (within ten pages) or randomly open to it in the book by approximate depth.  These functions are synonymous to me because essentially they work the same by keeping custom information.  In a hard copy you have limited space and might lose a sticky note or tucked index card where in an e-book you might have to guess where the comment trigger is to be found since it collapses.
Multiple Pages: As a subjective factor, being able to separate books and pages to be larger than a screen's resolution can accurately display helps me do the work faster.  However!  Using a laptop for almost all of my digital reading, I have been known to make a second copy of the core book in the folder so I can hold two pages simultaneously open in the same book without creating a conflict.  I have on many occasions held three or four books open and traversed them as easily as my books splayed like scalemail when the situation called for it.
Visibility: For hard copies of books the resolution is almost always perfect.  It matches the size of the viewer (IE the book's physical size) and thus you can always see a full page at the proper reading size.  While the viewing area is often limited on e-readers (I'm rarely displeased with monitors/laptops) the ability to zoom is surprisingly useful, especially for farsighted gamers.  Granted, you can zoom with a mundane magnifying lens on a hard copy as well.  But ultimately both methods fulfill the need equally to me objectively.  I can shrink a window and hold two completely different sources side by side concurrently when not using an e-reader specifically for PDFs.
Space: Being able to keep a library in a device the size of a 9v battery is quite handy... But where did you put that book on it?  Unless you're a database generating fiend such as myself, you probably just have a big mess of books in one spot with no sorting method in place, which when you're looking at a series of identical icons can get tiresome.  Sure hard copies take up space and weight but the visual indexing is powerful as is the mnemonic device of having to sort them as they go on the shelf (if you're even half as compulsive as me when it comes to books) and have at least two senses tied to their shelving - seeing the book slide into space, touching the book (as at least to me different publishers feel different in the slightest ways), maybe even smelling the book as you do.  However, searchable indexing on most devices tends to alleviate this issue which is why it shows up in the ""both"" category instead of as a distinct advantage.

Since I got my Kindle I have not read a single paper novel; they have fewer drawbacks compared to digital copies than rpg rulebooks.


Dead-tree types have some benefits like looking good on a bookshelf, but any ebook reader weighs less with 100 novels than the usual hard-cover book. 
If you want to look for the damage of Ares Alpha, even with a half-decent tablet it takes less than 2 seconds.  
Digital copies do not get worn, they never get unwanted earmarks, but you can bookmark them.
Rulebooks do get updates, and unless you are willing to take a pen to your book, your hard copies will never contain them. The pdfs can be edited and resent to the buyers. 
Even better is the WotC approach with the DDI, you can look up any monster or item or (almost any) rule, in the most recent form, for 3 years at the cost of seven books. 


I think this is the way to go, even considering the horribly slow character builder. Although I must admit good illustration can help build the athmosphere.

So what am I missing? Why are people buying rpg rulebooks in paper format? Why are books even published, I do not need to know if feats are supposed to be on the right page and skills on the left, I just want a list of them, filterable any way I want. 

Is this just a necessary part of earning money? I understand that pdfs are copied illegally, but the Compendium is not.

From what I can tell its pretty straight forward tracking, like google re-marketing, you pass them the information you want to via some javascript, and they target your visitors with targeted ads you have set up.

The main issue I have is they require us to point two cnames at their system to allow for ""First Party Cookies"". 

I know this means all cookies would have to be changed to www.foobar.com, instead of foobar.com, to avoid any issues with information being possible exposed to their end.

But more I was wondering what type of attacks this could open us up to if they had a security issue, if this is more or less secure than google's re-marketings model, and what issues could this cause for us with PCI compliance?

The main issue I have is they require us to point two cnames at their system to allow for ""First Party Cookies"". 

I know this means all cookies would have to be changed to www.foobar.com, instead of foobar.com, to avoid any issues with information being possible exposed to their end.

But more I was wondering what type of attacks this could open us up to if they had a security issue, if this is more or less secure than google's re-marketings model, and what issues could this cause for us with PCI compliance?

PS We use Braintree and Braintree.js so we are just covered under PCI for handling of Tokens, if that matters at all.
","Cookies that are used to maintain session state must have a limited scope.

Using JavaScript track users by their session id,  means you can't use the httpOnly cookie flag. Scoping cookies to *.foobar.com means that XSS on *.foobar.com could compromise this cookie value. Or to put this another way, if a session id is scoped to *.foobar.com and doesn't have the httpOnly flag, then every domain on *.foobar.com is permitted to compromise a session using XSS.  In the context of PCI compliance,  this specific design would greatly expand the attack surface that needs to be regularly validated.  

One solution is to use another randomly generated token for the purposes of tracking users, and then protect the authenticated session id as a separate cookie value.

5872,5872,9300,Service Layer Pattern - Could we avoid the service layer on a specific case?,"we are trying to implement an application using the Service Layer Pattern cause our application needs to connect to other multiple applications too, and googling on the web, we found this link of a demonstrative graphic for the ""right"" way of apply the pattern:

martinfowler.com - Service Layer Pattern

But now we have a question: what if our system needs to implement some business logic, only for our application (like some maintenance data for the system itself) that we don't need to share with other systems. Based on this graphic:



As it seems, it will be unnecesary to implement a service layer just for that; it will be more practical to avoid the service layer, and just go from User Interface to the Business Layer (for example). What should be the right way in this case to implement the Service Layer Pattern? What do you suggest us for a scenario like the one I told you?

",Jonathan,https://dba.stackexchange.com/users/3417,"One good source to refer to on FORCE INDEX would be the book MySQL Database Design and Tuning.



On page 120 paragraph 4, it says:


  Where does FORCE INDEX fit in? FORCE INDEX (first enabled in version
  4.0.9) is very similar to USE INDEX; the main difference between the two options is that FORCE INDEX demands that MySQL use the index (if
  possible) in lieu of a more expensive table scan, whereas USE INDEX
  still allows the optimizer to choose a table scan.


The same page says that MySQL does not warn that an index is irrelevant and switches to a table scan in the case of USE INDEX.

Thus, FORCE INDEX can take the MySQL Query Optimizer out of the equation before using the index. Any query using FORCE INDEX properly will reduce I/O. Why do I say properly?

Think about it. If the index you choose to navigate through is a covering index and you only need the columns as listed in the covering index, contacting the table for data becomes unnecessary. All I/O is restricted to index pages. All the data requested is retrieved by performing index scans in the worst case. That is indeed a good thing if the requested data needs to be ordered, thus bypass any requested sorting.

In terms of ""rules of engagements"", FORCE INDEX should only be used when


referring to covering indexes
all columns in the index are small in size
you effectively tweek the caching behavior of SELECT queries

For adhoc queries, use SQL_NO_CACHE
For frequently updated data, cache judiciously



FORCE INDEX should not be made to force queries to use indexes if you are trying to fit a square peg in a round hole.

/var/log/Xorg.0.log and /var/log/dmesg, as well as the output of $ dmesg, use a format that looks like

I'm guessing/gathering that the numbers represent seconds and microseconds since startup.

However, my attempt to correlate these two sets of timestamps (using the output from uptime) gave a discrepancy of about 5000 seconds.

This is roughly the amount of time my computer was suspended for.

Is there a convenient way to map the numeric timestamps used by dmesg and Xorg into absolute timestamps?

update

As a preliminary step towards getting this figured out, and also to hopefully make my question a bit more clear, I've written a Python script to parse /var/log/syslog and output the time skew.  On my machine, running ubuntu 10.10, that file contains numerous kernel-originated lines which are stamped both with the dmesg timestamp and the syslog timestamp.  The script outputs a line for each line in that file which contains a kernel timestamp.

Usage:

python syslogdriver.py /var/log/syslog | column -nts $'\t'

... The final lines are from a bit further down, still well above the end of the output.  Some of them presumably got written to dmesg's circular buffer before the suspend happened, and were only propagated to syslog afterwards.  This explains why all of them have the same syslog timestamp.

Column definitions:

abs is the time logged by syslog.

abs_since_boot is that same time in seconds since system startup, based on the contents of /proc/uptime and the value of time.time().

rel_time is the kernel timestamp.

rel_offset is the difference between abs_since_boot and rel_time.  I'm rounding this to the tens of seconds so as to avoid one-off errors due to the absolute (i.e. syslog-generated) timestamps only having seconds precision.  That's actually not the right way to do it, since it really (I think..) just results in a smaller chance of having an off-by-10 error.  If somebody has a better idea, please let me know.

I also have some questions about syslog's date format; in particular, I'm wondering if a year ever shows up in it.  I'm guessing no, and in any case could most likely help myself to that information in TFM, but if somebody happens to know it would be useful.  ..Assuming, of course, that someone uses this script at some point in the future, instead of just busting out a couple of lines of Perl code.

Next:

So unless some welcome revelation is unto me given by one of You, my next step will be to add a function to get the time skew for a given kernel timestamp.  I should be able to feed the script one or a set of syslogs, along with a kernel timestamp, to get an absolute timestamp.  Then I can get back to debugging my Xorg issues, which escape me at the moment.
",intuited,https://unix.stackexchange.com/users/1535,"You can give this a try :

First, get the timestamp of the dmesg file (my assumption is this will be dmesg's time 0).  You'll use ls -l --time-style=+%s

/var/log$ ls -l --time-style=+%s dmesg
-rw-r----- 1 root adm 56181 1294941018 dmesg


You can convert the seconds into a human-readable date with

perl -e 'print scalar localtime(1294941018)' 


So to see a readable event time, add in the seconds from the event in dmesg.  If the dmesg event was 55.290387 seconds in, add 55 or 55.290387 :

perl -e 'print scalar localtime(1294953978 + 55)'


Another way to transform epochal-rooted seconds into readable time is to use date -d as suggested.
If you tell 'date' to represent a time supplied with -d , you can indicate that the time to be converted is in seconds-since-the-epoch by using @ . 

date -d ""@1294953978""


This gives you something like ""Thu Jan 13 15:26:18 CST 2011"" as output.

date +%s will print the current time in the seconds-since-epoch format.

",Noldorin,https://music.stackexchange.com/users/179,"This is a great question that is subtlely different from the usual ""what is the difference between A♭ and G♯?"" Apart from frequency differences in non-12-et tunings, that question relates to the function of the note within the chord/scale/key.

But if we're talking about choice of key, then there are other factors at work. Obviously in non-12-et tunings, the choice of A♭ major vs G♯ major does have to do with how it will sound. But let's assume 12-et for the rest of this answer.

There are three general factors that, I would have thought (but see below about Bach), led a composer in the common practice era to choose one key over another enharmonic one:


avoid double sharps and double flats in the key signature itself
reduce double sharps and double flats in the keys to be modulated to
reduce double sharps and double flats in the keys used by transposed instruments 


As others have mentioned, the Well-Tempered Clavier is interesting here. The point of the piece was to demonstrate the 12-major and 12-minor keys on an instrument where enharmonic notes have the same frequency. So frequency-wise there really can only be 12 major keys.

But from a naming point of view (assuming you wouldn't be as crazy as to have double sharps or double flats in your tonic) you have 21 possible key names for each of major and minor.

How would one go about choosing which 12 key names out of 21 to use? First step might be to avoid double sharps and double flats in the key signature itself. Note that the result is different between major and minor keys (as WTC demonstrates). That reduces your choice from 21 to 15 (so G♯ D♯ A♯ E♯ B♯ F♭ majors are out)

Then it likely just comes down to what you're going to modulate too. If you are going to modulate to V, you might want to avoid having to introduce the double-sharp to do so (which means C♯ major is out). If you are going to modulate to V of V, then F♯ might be out too).

All that said, it makes it particular interesting that WTC does use C♯ major and F♯ major and instead eschews D♭ G♭ C♭ to get from 15 possibilities to 12. The C♯ major prelude and fugue does indeed need a double-sharp in modulated passages, even though the note is diatonic.

In the case of ensemble pieces with transposing instruments: imagine a clarinet part in concert C♯ major :-)

There are three general factors that, I would have thought (but see below about Bach), led a composer in the common practice era to choose one key over another enharmonic one:


avoid double sharps and double flats in the key signature itself
reduce double sharps and double flats in the keys to be modulated to
reduce double sharps and double flats in the keys used by transposed instruments 


As others have mentioned, the Well-Tempered Clavier is interesting here. The point of the piece was to demonstrate the 12-major and 12-minor keys on an instrument where enharmonic notes have the same frequency. So frequency-wise there really can only be 12 major keys.

But from a naming point of view (assuming you wouldn't be as crazy as to have double sharps or double flats in your tonic) you have 21 possible key names for each of major and minor.

How would one go about choosing which 12 key names out of 21 to use? First step might be to avoid double sharps and double flats in the key signature itself. Note that the result is different between major and minor keys (as WTC demonstrates). That reduces your choice from 21 to 15 (so G♯ D♯ A♯ E♯ B♯ F♭ majors are out)

Then it likely just comes down to what you're going to modulate too. If you are going to modulate to V, you might want to avoid having to introduce the double-sharp to do so (which means C♯ major is out). If you are going to modulate to V of V, then F♯ might be out too).

All that said, it makes it particular interesting that WTC does use C♯ major and F♯ major and instead eschews D♭ G♭ C♭ to get from 15 possibilities to 12. The C♯ major prelude and fugue does indeed need a double-sharp in modulated passages, even though the note is diatonic.

In the case of ensemble pieces with transposing instruments: imagine a clarinet part in concert C♯ major :-)

1639,1639,2574,Parse order and/or single/double quote issue with Calendar events and Google Map Info Window,"I am utilizing a combination of Solspace 'Calendar', 'Playa', and 'Google Maps for ExpressionEngine'. I'm having a strange issue where the dates aren't showing up correctly in my infowindows on the Google Map, but they show up fine using the same code outside of the infowindow.

So, I have a 'Location' channel, and an 'Event' channel. The Event channel is associated with the Calendar module, and uses a Playa single relationship field to relate it to a Location.

I am adding markers to the map for every 'Location', and for each marker, I'm populating the infowindow with the Location details. this includes using the Playa:Parents method to show all of the events that are at that location. 

I copied the code from the Solspace Calendar demo template for a single event to show the event date, because it had all the conditionals all worked out to deal with single day or multi-day events well. 

My problem is that in the infowindow, it's only showing the 'From' date, and not the 'To' part of the date string. It shows it correctly when I output it outside of the map, though. Here is the code that is outputting the date information. 

    {exp:calendar:events}
    &lt;b&gt;From:&lt;/b&gt; {event_first_date format=""%F %j, %Y at %g:%i%a""}
    {if event_never_ends}
        (never ends)
    {if:else}
        {if ""{event_first_date format='%Y%m%d%g%i%a'}"" != ""{event_last_date format='%Y%m%d%g%i%a'}""} &lt;b&gt;to:&lt;/b&gt;
            {if ""{event_first_date format=""%Y%m%d""}"" != ""{event_last_date format=""%Y%m%d""}""}
                {event_last_date format=""%l, %F %j, %Y at %g:%i%a""}
            {if:else}
                {event_last_date format=""%g:%i%a""}
            {/if}
        {/if}
    {/if}
    &lt;a href=""{path=find-music/event/{url_title}}""&gt;{title}&lt;/a&gt;
{/exp:calendar:events}


But this is how it outputs, in the infowindow, and outside of the map.

(crap, I don't have enough 'reputation' to post the image here, but it's here: http://paleosun.com/misc/stackexchange-map-calendar-question.jpg)

Notice, the section below the map has the ""to"" date. Same code is used to output it.

I have determined that something is going wrong with the quotes in the event date formatting tags. The {if ""{event_first_date format='%Y%m%d%g%i%a'}"" != ""{event_last_date format='%Y%m%d%g%i%a'}""} part is never resolving to 'true' like it should. In fact, If I just try to output {event_first_date format='%Y%m%d%g%i%a'} in the infowindow part, nothing show up. However, if I use double quotes and output {event_first_date format=""%Y%m%d%g%i%a""} it DOES work. The problem is, I cannot use that fix in the conditional, because double quotes are already being used around the output of that tag...

Any ideas why? Or what I can do as a work-around?

",Gary Reckard,https://expressionengine.stackexchange.com/users/1527,"I never used GoogleMpas for EECMS, but let's try something.

I already had some problems to solve because of nested exp:channel:entries and exp:channel:events.

So, let's first move them to an embed, but trying to reduce the number of times the modules are parsed and improve the performance.

{embed=""events/.mapmarkers"" event_ids=""{exp:playa:parents channel='calendar_events' backspace='1'}{entry_id}|{/exp:playa:parents}""}


The default format of the variables of exp:channel:events is already YYYYMMDD. So you don't need to format some of your conditionals.

{if ""{event_first_date}"" != ""{event_last_date}""}


Other conditionals, can have the double and single quotation marks replaced and the '%a' can be removed if you use '%H'.

{if '{event_first_date format=""%Y%m%d%H%i""}' != '{event_last_date format=""%Y%m%d%H%i""}' }


Your embed will look like this:

I'm having a strange issue where the dates aren't showing up correctly in my infowindows on the Google Map, but they show up fine using the same code outside of the infowindow.

So, I have a 'Location' channel, and an 'Event' channel. The Event channel is associated with the Calendar module, and uses a Playa single relationship field to relate it to a Location.

I am adding markers to the map for every 'Location', and for each marker, I'm populating the infowindow with the Location details. this includes using the Playa:Parents method to show all of the events that are at that location. 

I copied the code from the Solspace Calendar demo template for a single event to show the event date, because it had all the conditionals all worked out to deal with single day or multi-day events well. 

My problem is that in the infowindow, it's only showing the 'From' date, and not the 'To' part of the date string. It shows it correctly when I output it outside of the map, though. Here is the code that is outputting the date information. 

    {exp:calendar:events}
    &lt;b&gt;From:&lt;/b&gt; {event_first_date format=""%F %j, %Y at %g:%i%a""}
    {if event_never_ends}
        (never ends)
    {if:else}
        {if ""{event_first_date format='%Y%m%d%g%i%a'}"" != ""{event_last_date format='%Y%m%d%g%i%a'}""} &lt;b&gt;to:&lt;/b&gt;
            {if ""{event_first_date format=""%Y%m%d""}"" != ""{event_last_date format=""%Y%m%d""}""}
                {event_last_date format=""%l, %F %j, %Y at %g:%i%a""}
            {if:else}
                {event_last_date format=""%g:%i%a""}
            {/if}
        {/if}
    {/if}
    &lt;a href=""{path=find-music/event/{url_title}}""&gt;{title}&lt;/a&gt;
{/exp:calendar:events}


But this is how it outputs, in the infowindow, and outside of the map.

(crap, I don't have enough 'reputation' to post the image here, but it's here: http://paleosun.com/misc/stackexchange-map-calendar-question.jpg)

Notice, the section below the map has the ""to"" date. Same code is used to output it.

I have determined that something is going wrong with the quotes in the event date formatting tags. The {if ""{event_first_date format='%Y%m%d%g%i%a'}"" != ""{event_last_date format='%Y%m%d%g%i%a'}""} part is never resolving to 'true' like it should. In fact, If I just try to output {event_first_date format='%Y%m%d%g%i%a'} in the infowindow part, nothing show up. However, if I use double quotes and output {event_first_date format=""%Y%m%d%g%i%a""} it DOES work. The problem is, I cannot use that fix in the conditional, because double quotes are already being used around the output of that tag...

Any ideas why? Or what I can do as a work-around?

    {/exp:channel:entries}
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- /#location-container --&gt;

","I never used GoogleMpas for EECMS, but let's try something.

I already had some problems to solve because of nested exp:channel:entries and exp:channel:events.

So, let's first move them to an embed, but trying to reduce the number of times the modules are parsed and improve the performance.

{embed=""events/.mapmarkers"" event_ids=""{exp:playa:parents channel='calendar_events' backspace='1'}{entry_id}|{/exp:playa:parents}""}


The default format of the variables of exp:channel:events is already YYYYMMDD. So you don't need to format some of your conditionals.

{if ""{event_first_date}"" != ""{event_last_date}""}


Other conditionals, can have the double and single quotation marks replaced and the '%a' can be removed if you use '%H'.

{if '{event_first_date format=""%Y%m%d%H%i""}' != '{event_last_date format=""%Y%m%d%H%i""}' }


Your embed will look like this:

{if embed:event_ids !== """"}
    &lt;ul&gt;
    {exp:calendar:events parse=""inward"" event_id=""{embed:event_ids}""}
        &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;b&gt;From:&lt;/b&gt; {event_first_date format=""%F %j, %Y at %g:%i%a""}

            {if:else}
                {if '{event_first_date format=""%Y%m%d%H%i""}' != '{event_last_date format=""%Y%m%d%H%i""}' } &lt;b&gt;to:&lt;/b&gt;
                    {if ""{event_first_date}"" != ""{event_last_date}""}
                        {event_last_date format=""%l, %F %j, %Y at %g:%i%a""}

1147,1147,1802,Why not have the gears inside the bottom bracket?,"Looking into an IGH it seems the biggest disadvantage is having a huge amount of rotating mass. I've seen one handmade bike where the IGH sits above the bracket, inside a carbon fibre shroud around the place some bikes have rear suspension. There are two chains, one driving the IGH and another to drive the rear wheel. 

Why not have an internally geared bottom bracket where the cranks drive the input shaft and the crank ring rotates at a ratio selectable by the gear lever? 

Then the rear wheel could have a single drive wheel driven by a chain or belt and a lightweight hub just solid enough to mount the spokes and disc. Then you could have mud-free gearing while reducing rotating mass even below what you have with a conventional cassette... and given that you have thrown out the bottom bracket the overall weight gain would be less.

Quite a job for the home builder to adapt an existing hub I guess but it should be possible.

3439,3439,5470,Array Binding simple example doesn't work,"I'm very new to xaml and I'm trying to understand the Binding issue. I have a problem with the Array Binding. I created this very simple example: I have a stack panel with three images. Each image has a RotationTransform. Each Angle is obtained by an array element (the array is a DependencyProperty called Rotations). This is the xaml simple file:

&lt;StackPanel Orientation=""Vertical""&gt;

        &lt;Image Source=""/Assets/spoon.png"" Width=""50"" Height=""100"" Stretch=""Uniform"" RenderTransformOrigin=""0.5,0.5""&gt;
            &lt;Image.RenderTransform&gt;

                Click=""Op_Click""/&gt;

    {        
        public static readonly DependencyProperty RotationsProperty = DependencyProperty.Register(""Rotations"", typeof(double[]), typeof(MainPage),
            new PropertyMetadata(new double[3]));

        public double[] Rotations
        {
            get { return (double[])GetValue(RotationsProperty); }
            set { SetValue(RotationsProperty, value); }

            Rotations[2] = 180;
        }
    }


The binding works only the first time (at startup time). When I click on the button (changing the Rotations array) the binding doesn't work and it is completely ignored from my images. 

This is a very simple example, so it's clear that I miss something concerning the Binding issue.

It's did and not do because it is in the past tense. You aren't currently meeting the colleague on the way to work. Also, because it is the verb to do, the verb to meet stays in present tense because do, along with be and have, is a primary auxiliary verb.

1148,1148,1803,How difficult is it to undertake a Humanities PhD. at Harvard (converting to the American system from Europe/UK?),"Before I begin, feel I should make it clear that I have no doubt that undertaking a PhD. anywhere, let alone at Harvard, will be a difficult and strenuous task!

To briefly explain, I have graduated with a good Bachelors of Arts from the UK, and am set to do my Research Masters in Holland. However, I have been in contact and have contacted the literature faculties in Harvard, who have been very encouraging but, to be honest, the system itself seems very different.

To clarify, I'll copy in some of what my (possible) supervisor has emailed me:

Our students enter the program, take two or three years of courses, and only then settle on a dissertation topic and choose a committee of three faculty -- one primary advisor and two other readers.

This sounds at once much more fluid and liberal a way of doing things, but, considering the ridiculous costs of studying in the USA, I'm not sure how leisurely that would be in reality! Should I assume that Doctoral programs in the USA are like a Masters leading into a PhD? Is there a scholarship available for both of these? 
Has anyone reading this had any experience on the matter, and can relate more clearly how this process works, and whether exceptions are every possible? 
",Byron Taylor,https://academia.stackexchange.com/users/31359,"The quoted description is pretty standard for how Humanities departments in the US work. Most students entering Humanities PhD programs in the States do not have MA degrees, although a significant proportion of those from the UK do. It would be unlikely that you could skip those first 2-3 years of coursework.

In the Humanities, it is unlikely that any supervisors will have grants that pay for PhD students, but there are grants that you can apply directly for. Some of these cover students in the first few years, but most are for more senior students.

At Harvard (from Europe / UK to us system?),"Before I begin, feel I should make it clear that I have no doubt that undertaking a PhD. anywhere, let alone at Harvard, will be a difficult and strenuous task!

To briefly explain, I have graduated with a good Bachelors of Arts from the UK, and am set to do my Research Masters in Holland. However, I have been in contact and have contacted the literature faculties in Harvard, who have been very encouraging but, to be honest, the system itself seems very different.

To clarify, I'll copy in some of what my (possible) supervisor has emailed me:

Our students enter the program, take two or three years of courses, and only then settle on a dissertation topic and choose a committee of three faculty -- one primary advisor and two other readers.

This sounds at once much more fluid and liberal a way of doing things, but, considering the ridiculous costs of studying in the USA, I'm not sure how leisurely that would be in reality! Should I assume that Doctoral programs in the USA are like a Masters leading into a PhD? Is there a scholarship available for both of these? 
Has anyone reading this had any experience on the matter, and can relate more clearly how this process works, and whether exceptions are every possible?

5090,5090,8097,Why can syn-periplanar E2 elimination happen in molecules like vinyl bromides but seemingly not in other molecules?,"E2 eliminations occur when the leaving group and the proton are in the anti-periplanar conformation not syn-periplanar. This is beyond a merely a preference as leads to E2 reactions being stereoselective. However, when it comes to vinyl bromides for example (involving a double bond) the reaction can occur in the Z- and E- isomers (i.e both syn-periplanar and anti-periplanar). How can this be the case? 
",RobChem,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/users/6925,"Elimination from vinyl halides occurs faster when the halide and proton have a trans relationship.  When the halide and proton are located on the same side of the double bond (cis), the elimination to form an alkyne is much slower.  The faster elimination from the trans arrangement is consistent with a preferred anti-periplanar arrangement in the E2 reaction.  

The fact that elimination still occurs, albeit at a slower rate, when the groups being eliminated are arranged cis to one another suggests that a different mechanism is involved in the ""cis"" case.  Two possible mechanistic alternatives are


cis elimination from a higher energy (higher energy, therefore less preferred, slower) syn-periplanar conformation, or
an E1CB mechanism where the proton is removed in a first step and a carbanion is generated, and this is followed by halide ejection in a second step.

5998,5998,9511,What kind of dose can you expect from a radioactive lens?,"I read that lens makers used to use radioactive glass to increase the refractive index property of their lenses.

How radioactive are they?

Here are some example dosages; where would looking through the viewfinder for an hour fit?

http://xkcd.com/radiation/



",Louis,https://photo.stackexchange.com/users/5392,"The article in rfusca's answer includes some references: The Aero-Ektars, by NASA scientist Michael Briggs; Radioactive Materials in Camera Lenses, from the Health Physics Society (an organization focused on radiation safety); and Thoriated Camera Lens (ca. 1970s), from Oak Ridge Associated Universities's professional training on radiation safety.

From the ORAU PTP article:


  Measurements have indicated that the exposure rate at a depth of 10 cm
  in the body of an individual carrying a camera containing 0.36 uCi of
  thorium would be approximately 0.01 mrem/hr.  Based on this value,
  NUREG-1717 calculated that a serious photographer might receive an
  annual exposure of 2 mrem. This assumed that the photographer carried
  the camera 30 days per year and for 6 hours per day. They also
  estimated an exposure of 0.7 mrem per year for an average
  photographer.  If the camera lens contained the maximum permitted
  concentration of thorium (30%), NUREG-1717 estimated that the
  aforementioned annual doses could triple.


This puts the ""6hrs/day for a month"" usage at about the same as getting a chest X-ray — or, one little green square on the xkcd chart. Or to put it another way, using the lens six hours a day for a year would be the same as taking three round-trip flights from one US coast to the other in that year. Not completely trivial, but not something people normally stress about. And that'd be really heavy usage.

The articles indicate that exposure to the eye might be a greater concern than overall dosage, particularly if you happen to have thorium in an eyepiece (unlikely for general photo equipment). So you might decide to spend a little less time holding the camera right to your eye than you might otherwise.

Assuming (based on the reading) that looking through the viewfinder is very roughly an order of magnitude greater exposure than the general usage, looking through the viewfinder for an hour is about 1µSv — equivalent to getting an arm x-ray.

6042,6042,9587,How do I tell the difference between a borrowed chord and a key change?,"Having muddled through for a few years, I'm finally learning the basics of harmony. I'm having a bit of trouble, though understanding exactly what goes on when chords occur from outside the key. Is the key changing? Or are these 'borrowed' chords, and in which case, how are they decided on?

For example, see the classic ""I Can't Forget"" by Leonard Cohen.


            
                
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    
                
            

Here is an apparently accurate transcription of the chords in the verse:

http://www.maartenmassa.be/CohenChords/09iym/i_cant_forget.htm

    F#
I stumbled out of bed
       D#m
I got ready for the struggle
F#
I smoked a cigarette
     D#m               C#
And I tightened up my gut
   B         Bm       G#m
I said this can't be me
 A#          E    D#m
Must be my double
F#              B    
And I can't forget... (etc)


OK, so I see I-vi-I-vi-V of F# major, taking us to the line ""I said this can't be me"". This makes sense to me. But what happens then? 

It seems to modulate to B minor - fine, I think we're heading for a scale with B minor in it, ie A major, D major(/B minor),  or G major. But this is followed immediately by G#m, though, so it's not any of those (maybe we're back in F#?), but then we get A#!? E? 

I am totally confused at this point as to what key we're in.

It's particularly galling as the change to A# is my favourite chord change in the song, and the whole run from B to D#m, and then back to F#, is weirdly satisfying.

Can anyone explain what's going on here?
",djb,https://music.stackexchange.com/users/10437,"Without hearing the song this is what is likely happening:


  F# I stumbled out of bed
  
  D#m I got ready for the struggle 
  
  F# I smoked a cigarette
  
  D#m - C# And I tightened up my gut


This is fairly straight-forward, moving along in the key of F#: I-vi-I-vi-V

From there, it is a deceptively cadences to ""B"" (IV) instead of the expected return to ""F#"":


  B - Bm - G#m I said this can't be me  
  
  A# - E - D#m
  Must be my double 
  
  F# - B And I can't forget... (etc)


In this passage, he is using ""B"" as a local tonicization by treating as a pivot chord and implying a move to B major.  Using the first be as a pivot, we'd analyze the chords in the key of B major: I-i-vi-VII-IV-iii-V-I.

Obviously, with a VII, something odd is happening. It can't be a borrowed chord from the subdominant (if we were thinking of the entire passage in F#) because as a leading tone chord, it would be fully-diminished. So how does the A# chord function?

My answer is that the chord in of itself is inherently non-functional in terms of harmonic progression, but is function in creating some very nuanced inner-lines.  In order to understand what's really happening here we need to look at the text along with the chords.



In order to understand the second part, we must first look at the top stanza highlighted above.  Notice how an association is developed between the personal pronoun ""I"" and the chordal motion from I-vi. Each line begins with ""I"" and the chord is either I or vi.

Now, looking at the second stanza, notice how the first line also contains the personal pronoun ""I"" along with a motion of I-vi (now in B major).  This is where things get interesting.  The straight-forward harmonic motion of the first stanza mirrors the confident, concrete observations and descriptions of actions detailed in the text.  It is only when the character begins questioning themselves that the harmonic motion begins to get wonky, which brings us back to the second stanza...

Notice how the chord quality changes from B to Bm with the phrase ""I said this can't be me"" - already the author is blurring the lines of functional tonality here in the same way the character in the song is confused. This fact is further supported by chromatic noodling of the inner-lines which I will outline below.  First, let us take a pitch inventory of the chords used:


B = B, D#, F#

Now I will arrange them to have smooth voice-leading to better illustrate the chromatic noodling in the inner lines:

A# = A#, C##(D), E#(F)
E = B, G#, E
D#m = A#, F#, D#
F# = A#, F#, C#


I have italicized all of the notes that move chromatically by step from the previous chord. As you can see by the numerous chromatic half-step motion between chords, Cohen is using the tried and true technique of word painting to emphasize the text's meaning.  In this case, the text suggests a blurring of identity through duality. Thus, Cohen uses chromatic half-step motion and local tonicization to the subdominant in F# major to suggest tonal implications of duality.

In the last line of the second stanza, we see a V-I in B major (an Authentic Cadence) that supports the text ""And I can't forget..."".  Such harmonic reinforcement (an Authentic Cadence is a strong cadence) suggests a ""snapping"" back to reality as the narrator of the song realizes that he cannot forget.  This harmonic motion provides stability to the wandering harmony of the previous lines, as if resuming where it had left off when beginning the section.  From here, Cohen could easily use the ""B"" as a pivot chord to move back into F# major and continue on.  (I don't know what happens as I have not heard the piece.)

I'm having a bit of trouble, though understanding exactly what goes on when chords occur from outside the key. Is the key changing? Or are these 'borrowed' chords, and in which case, how are they decided on?

For example, see the classic ""I Can't Forget"" by Leonard Cohen.


            
                
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    
                
            

Here is an apparently accurate transcription of the chords in the verse:

http://www.maartenmassa.be/CohenChords/09iym/i_cant_forget.htm

    F#
I stumbled out of bed
       D#m
I got ready for the struggle
F#
I smoked a cigarette
     D#m               C#
And I tightened up my gut
   B         Bm       G#m
I said this can't be me
 A#          E    D#m
Must be my double
F#              B    
And I can't forget... (etc)


OK, so I see I-vi-I-vi-V of F# major, taking us to the line ""I said this can't be me"". This makes sense to me. But what happens then? 

It seems to modulate to B minor - fine, I think we're heading for a scale with B minor in it, ie A major, D major(/B minor),  or G major. But this is followed immediately by G#m, though, so it's not any of those (maybe we're back in F#?), but then we get A#!? E? 

I am totally confused at this point as to what key we're in.

It's particularly galling as the change to A# is my favourite chord change in the song, and the whole run from B to D#m, and then back to F#, is weirdly satisfying.

Can anyone explain what's going on here?
","Without hearing the song this is what is likely happening:


  F# I stumbled out of bed
  
  D#m I got ready for the struggle 
  
  F# I smoked a cigarette
  
  D#m - C# And I tightened up my gut


This is fairly straight-forward, moving along in the key of F#: I-vi-I-vi-V

From there, it is a deceptively cadences to ""B"" (IV) instead of the expected return to ""F#"":


  B - Bm - G#m I said this can't be me  
  
  A# - E - D#m
  Must be my double 
  
  F# - B And I can't forget... (etc)


In this passage, he is using ""B"" as a local tonicization by treating as a pivot chord and implying a move to B major.  Using the first be as a pivot, we'd analyze the chords in the key of B major: I-i-vi-VII-IV-iii-V-I.

Obviously, with a VII, something odd is happening. It can't be a borrowed chord from the subdominant (if we were thinking of the entire passage in F#) because as a leading tone chord, it would be fully-diminished. So how does the A# chord function?

My answer is that the chord in of itself is inherently non-functional in terms of harmonic progression, but is function in creating some very nuanced inner-lines.  In order to understand what's really happening here we need to look at the text along with the chords.



In order to understand the second part, we must first look at the top stanza highlighted above.  Notice how an association is developed between the personal pronoun ""I"" and the chordal motion from I-vi. Each line begins with ""I"" and the chord is either I or vi.

Now, looking at the second stanza, notice how the first line also contains the personal pronoun ""I"" along with a motion of I-vi (now in B major).  This is where things get interesting.  The straight-forward harmonic motion of the first stanza mirrors the confident, concrete observations and descriptions of actions detailed in the text.  It is only when the character begins questioning themselves that the harmonic motion begins to get wonky, which brings us back to the second stanza...

Notice how the chord quality changes from B to Bm with the phrase ""I said this can't be me"" - already the author is blurring the lines of functional tonality here in the same way the character in the song is confused. This fact is further supported by chromatic noodling of the inner-lines which I will outline below.  First, let us take a pitch inventory of the chords used:


B = B, D#, F#
Bm = B, D, F#
G#m = G#, B, D#
A# = A#, C##, E#
E = E, G#, B
D#m = D#, F#, A#
F# = F#, A#, C#


Now I will arrange them to have smooth voice-leading to better illustrate the chromatic noodling in the inner lines:


B = B, D#, F#
Bm = B, D, F#
G#m = B, D#, G#
A# = A#, C##(D), E#(F)
E = B, G#, E
D#m = A#, F#, D#
F# = A#, F#, C#

The morale? Why try to even hide javascript? Include a short copyright notice and author information. If you want to hide it so an, say, authentication system cannot be hacked, consider strengthening the server-side so there are no open holes in server that are closed merely though javascript. Headers, and requests can easily be faked through curl or other tools.

If you really want to hide the javascript... don't use javascript. Use a complied langage of sorts (java applets, flash, activex) etc. (I wouldn't do this though, because it is not a very good option compared to native javascript).

1032,1032,1623,How do I stop Windows from moving desktop Icons?,"I have two monitors connected to my computer. (same graphics card.  One HDMI, the other DVI).

Whenever I do one of the following things, my icons move around on my desktop:


Play a Game
Turn off one monitor


When I stop playing the game or turn one of the monitors back on, Windows 7 does not properly restore the icon locations.

Is there is a way I can prevent Windows from moving my desktop icons around?
",ray023,https://superuser.com/users/37183,"I found something that works for me and hopefully it will work for others too.


Without your monitors plugged in, right-click on your desktop, hover over ""View"" and turn off the feature ""Align icons to grid""
Plug in your monitor and proceed only if your icons remain in their original positions
Turn ""Align icons to grid"" back on the same way you turned it off.


Using the steps above, this should allow you to unplug/turn-off monitors and replug/turn-on monitors without your icons moving all over the place.

I noticed with this, however, that it's save-file-like and you will need to redo the steps if you want to move icons around. I tested this by unplugging my monitor, moving an icon (without changing the grid feature) and plugging my monitor back in. I observed that the icon returned to its original position on my desktop as it was before I moved it and the rest of my icons stayed in the same spot. I then unplugged my monitor and found that icon to move to where I originally moved it to, so I turned the grid feature off, plugged in my monitor and then turned the grid feature back on and found the icon to stay in its new position.

I don't know how well this will work for your games (worst off you just need to leave the grid feature off) but it will hopefully solve turning monitors on and off.

(same graphics card.  One HDMI, the other DVI).

Whenever I do one of the following things, my icons move around on my desktop:


Play a Game
Turn off one monitor


When I stop playing the game or turn one of the monitors back on, Windows 7 does not properly restore the icon locations.

Is there is a way I can prevent Windows from moving my desktop icons around?
","I found something that works for me and hopefully it will work for others too.


Without your monitors plugged in, right-click on your desktop, hover over ""View"" and turn off the feature ""Align icons to grid""
Plug in your monitor and proceed only if your icons remain in their original positions
Turn ""Align icons to grid"" back on the same way you turned it off.


Using the steps above, this should allow you to unplug/turn-off monitors and replug/turn-on monitors without your icons moving all over the place.

I noticed with this, however, that it's save-file-like and you will need to redo the steps if you want to move icons around. I tested this by unplugging my monitor, moving an icon (without changing the grid feature) and plugging my monitor back in. I observed that the icon returned to its original position on my desktop as it was before I moved it and the rest of my icons stayed in the same spot. I then unplugged my monitor and found that icon to move to where I originally moved it to, so I turned the grid feature off, plugged in my monitor and then turned the grid feature back on and found the icon to stay in its new position.

2391,2391,3816,What are the symmetries of a principal homogeneous bundle?,"Let $\operatorname{Klein}$ denote the category of principal homogeneous bundles. An object in this category is a tuple $\mathbf Q = (Q, P; G, H; q, a, \tilde a)$, where:


$G$ is a Lie group, and $H$ is a closed subgroup;
$P$ is a $G$-torsor and the manifold $Q$ is diffeomorphic to the quotient $G/H$;
The (left) actions $\tilde a : G \to \operatorname{Aut}(P)$ and $a : G \to \operatorname{Aut}(Q)$ are morphisms of topological groups; and
$q :P \to Q$ is a principal $H$-bundle.


A morphism $\Phi : \mathbf Q \to \mathbf Q'$ is described by a tuple $\Phi = (\varphi, \tilde \varphi, f)$, where $\varphi : Q \to Q'$ and $\tilde \varphi : P \to P'$ are diffeomorphisms which commute with the bundle maps $q : P \to Q$ and $q' : P' \to Q'$, and $f : G \to G'$ is a morphism of Lie groups mapping $H$ to $H'$, and which satisfies the identity $$\tilde a'_{f(g)} \circ \tilde \varphi = \tilde \varphi \circ \tilde a_g$$ for all $g \in G$. 



I think that this is the correct categorical description of principal homogeneous bundles; please correct me if I'm wrong. I selected the name $\operatorname{Klein}$ in homage to Felix Klein and his Erlangen Program.

It seems that such a bundle $\mathbf Q$ contains all the data on its symmetries. Namely, I think that its automorphism group $\operatorname{Aut}(\mathbf Q)$ is isomorphic to its Lie group Lie group $G = G(\mathbf Q)$?

It is easy to see that there is a natural map $K : G \hookrightarrow \operatorname{Aut}(\mathbf Q)$, in that each $u \in G$ corresponds to a unique automorphism $K_u \in \operatorname{Aut}(\mathbf Q)$. The morphism $K_u = (k_u, \tilde k_u, c_u)$ is defined by $$k_u(q) = a_u(q), \quad \tilde k_u(p) = \tilde a_u(p), \quad \mathrm{and} \quad c_u(g) = ugu^{-1}.$$ That is, the morphism $K_u$ acts by left-multiplication on both $Q$ and $P$, but by left-conjugation on $G$.


Is this map $K$ surjective? i.e., is $\operatorname{Aut}(\mathbf Q)$ isomorphic to $G = G(\mathbf Q)$?


If the answer is yes, then I think that this captures the notion of ""internal symmetries"" of the bundle, since these are the transformations which preserve the bundle structure. 

However, I know that groupoids also show up to describe symmetries in a categorical setting, and I would be interested to hear more on that point of view.

5440,5440,8634,Intangibility in Marvel Heroic Roleplaying,"I am playing the Breakout event, as Spiderman (stop reading if you don't want spoilers!). We just met Zzzax, and I decided to attack him by web-throwing a huge metal pipe through him. I managed a Total 28, effect d10 action and aimed for Physical Stress.

The Watcher did a Reaction Roll, and got a Total 2, Effect d4 Reaction (yes, it is possible, only one die not an opportunity).

But the Watcher activated its ""Grounded"" Limit: Zzzax ignored all Stress, and became grounded through the pipe. And here is the disagreement:

His point of view: Since Zzzax has Intangibility d10, he ignores all physical attacks, the only way to defeat him is to activate his Limit and then over-complicate him. He activated the Limit because my roll was so high that it should have a result. He still has Intangibility even though his Power Set is shut down.

My point of view: Activating a Limit doesn't allow you to randomly ignore an attack. I can't ignore an attack and become Exhausted instead. Intangibility is just a die to add to Reaction rolls, not an automatic effect that allows you to ignore everything, that requires an SFX like Immunity(Physical attacks).

I went with his interpretation (and built a Faraday cage through web and pipes), but I still think that it was not right.

So how does Intangibility work? Is it an automatic effect, even without Immunity/Invulnerability SFXs, or is it just a resistance, allowing you to be attacked normally?

Since you ended up Complicating him out, we never get to see whether the Watcher would have spent from the Doom Pool to turn the Electrical Body power set back on. Your actions did take Zzzax out of the fight, at least for a while, which seems pretty good for a thrown object from Spider-Man.

",ripper234,https://gaming.stackexchange.com/users/1161,"I'll try to cover as much as I can in this answer.

As I stated in my comment it depends on what race you are playing against, what you scout, and when you are trying to get both these buildings. Map size also factors into your decision as well.

Since you are referring as to having to make a choice, I'm going to assume that you are trying to do this off one base on a relatively smaller map so all answers below will be tailored around that assumption. If it's a big map (like Tal'darim Alter) you can quickly get a second base and do something like a +1/+1 + charge or blink attack.

So what race are you playing against.

Terran
If you are playing terran that is going a heavy bio start, a forge is a good choice with a small zealot, sentry, and stalker army. Getting a quick +1 armour will reduce marine damage to zealots to 1 with a guardian shield up (Guardian shield reduces damage by 2, zealots start with 1 armour, marines attack for 5) making them that much stronger against against a bio army. 

If you scout them and they're going a tech route then it will boil down to what you plan on doing with your army and what path you will be choosing. Archons and storms do significant damage to a terran army late game. The same can be said if you go with colossi and upgrades if they don't have vikings either.

Zerg
This is a tough one to make a choice because zerg can swap so quickly with their army composition. The safer choice between the two is to go forge first with a +1 attack upgrade. The +1 attack allows for zealots to 2 shot zerglings instead of 3. This increases the effectiveness of zealots versus zerglings by 33%. 

That said, if they go roaches and you're heavy zealot, they can be kited forever on and off creep so you need to make sure you are fighting on your terms. A few sentries thrown in will stop them from running away so you can deal your damage. It does also mean that blink stalkers will have a significant advantage over roaches as well. Even charge would work too. But it depends on what their army composition is so you sort of need the most well rounded army possible. 

Keep in mind, late game, storms are very helpful versus the swarm.

Protoss
Again this comes down to army composition. If it's a stalker vs stalker fight, the player with blink will win (assuming properly blink micro).

If one of the players goes the colossi route later on, the one with the forge early with early attack upgrades will destroy the army of the guy that doesn't have the upgrades. 

This mirror match-up is difficult to theorize without scouting information. If you see a forge upgrading you need to get one in response, if you fall behind you will lose. It really depends on what you plan on going for a build. 

Generally speaking though forge is the safer bet. You can get quicker upgrades, and if you scout a Twilight council and dark shrine you have access to dropping a cannon to save you from Dark Templars as well without having to spend the money on a Robotics Bay and get an observer.

I've been using who.is all this time but the details for domains I look up aren't always recent. What whois database is the most accurate and up-to-date? I've tried looking up a few but it's hard to tell how often each one updates its database. 
",Miss M,https://webmasters.stackexchange.com/users/52761,"Being one who has a similar site, I would have thought who.is or whois.com were the most accurate. Mine is different in that I capture the information at the time of an attack, spam, or other similar event. However, most other sites will re-query the whois data when the page is accessed assuming that there is a measure to ensure that the same whois data is not being requested to often. Some sites subscribe and download bulk whois data from time to time and update their databases that way instead of relying on traffic.

",seeking_infinity,https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/57676,"There are lots of different types of plasmas.

In a thermal plasma the electrons and ions will have the same temperature.

In a non-thermal plasma the discharge is driven by some external power supply e.g. capacitatively coupled RF, inductively coupled, pulsed DC E field etc. 

In a non-thermal plasma the electrons generally have a higher temperature than the ions because the energy from the RF or E field couples with the electrons more efficiently. The electrons transfer energy to the gas to sustain the plasma. 

Strictly speaking non-thermal plasmas are not at equilibrium and we cannot necessarily define a temperature, but temperature is generally a useful concept to use.

Collision rates are generally lower for electrons than ions, but not always (e.g. very low energy electrons and SF6 has huge collision rate). 

The reason for the temperature difference is due partly to the driving energy being mostly coupled to the electrons and the partly because the energy is not rapidly transfered by collisions to the neutral gas and ions.

441,441,687,Can I use Ubuntu to diagnose hard drive or RAM problems in Windows?,"This may be a crazy question, but here goes...

My brother suggested that I could somehow use either a Ubuntu Live Boot CD or Flash drive or Kubuntu as a way to diagnose issues I'm currently having with my laptop. I'm running Windows 7 and for some reason my laptop has suddenly started freezing during Windows start up. This started immediately after I began seeing the hard drive light remaining on and my computer running very, very slowly - even though when I checked Task Manager it said that no applications or unusual processes were running at the time and CPU usage was 0%. Strange, I know.

I've used the Restore disks 3 times already, thinking maybe it was a virus, even though I run Norton 360 and it found nothing upon a full system scan. But every time I end up with Windows failing to start up at all, or it getting stuck on the ""Windows Starting"" screen for at least 15-20 minutes before it starts.

I'm at a total loss here. I'm thinking it is either a Hard drive issue or perhaps a RAM issue, but I am a total moron when it comes to the operational aspect of computers. I don't know where to begin. My brother said that if I used a flash drive of Ubuntu or Kubuntu and tried to boot from there that I would know immediately if it was my Hard drive because it wouldn't operate. I don't understand that since it wouldn't be operating off my hard drive, it would be running from the CD/flash drive.

Does anyone have any clues on what I can do to check this out? I'm tempted to buy a new hard drive and RAM, but would hate to buy something I can't return if they aren't the issue.

Sometimes people connect this to the RTS (or was it the CTS?) pin of the serial adapter. Device detect might be the same as pushing the Roomba's power button. After the Roomba prints the model and firmware version over the serial port it should be ready to receive commands.

I wouldn't recommend connecting the 5V device detect pin directly to the 3V Pi. You could just short it to ground manually (and briefly) to get started.

2072,2072,3302,How to submit errata when a coauthor disagrees,"Some years ago, I was the primary author on a paper in which some of the work was performed by a grad student. At the time I did not notice an error in his work, and so the derivation provided in the paper is incorrect. I contacted my coauthors, included the (former) grad student. The other authors readily agreed to have their names on the errata paper, but the former grad student disagreed and feels that his work was without error. And so he said that he did not want his name on the errata. Contacting the journal that published the original paper, the editor is not willing to publish an errata paper in which the author list does not include the entire list of authors from the original paper.

So I'm stuck. I'm quite certain about the error, and frustrated with the former student's insistence on being correct. But now there is no way to get the errata into the literature. The journal editor suggested perhaps publishing the changes as a ""comment paper"", but comment papers are only allowed if written by someone other than one of the original authors. So that's no help either. I can publish the errata on ArXiV, but many readers of the original paper will never find it.

Does anyone have suggestions on how to get this correction into the literature?
",nzh,https://academia.stackexchange.com/users/33781,"I'll give a few options that occur to me.


Talk to the editor. Essentially ask him what to do. On the one hand he has a policy he wants to follow, and on the other hand he presumably wants corrections of erroneous papers to appear. After all, the alternative is that someone points the error out in a different venue, and the whole community laughs at his journal. Perhaps he will be willing to bend his rules a bit.


You will need to discuss any possible solution with the editor, anyway, so you may want to start out with the most obvious option.


What's to keep you from writing something titled ""Erratum"" with the whole list of authors X, Y and Z, but with two sections ""1. The Erratum (X, Y)"" and ""2. A dissenting point of view (Z)""? Yes, of course we want a paper to have a unified message, but in this particular case, I'd say that getting the word out in any way is better than burying the discussion under mounds of policy.
Propose that you write the erratum, but allow the dissenting author to comment on the erratum and explain why he thinks the erratum is erroneous. Then send both the erratum and the comment out to review and see what the reviewers say.
Perhaps you can do the discussion under point 2. above on the ArXiv, but publish an ""erratum"" with the full author list that does not discuss the error but only points to this discussion on the ArXiv.


One bonus for options 2-4: actually writing up these papers will force everyone to really think about the derivation in question, and either you or the dissenting author may change his mind about whether there is or is not an error.

Option 1 puts the onus on the editor, who may not be very flexible, judging from your question. (Of course, we don't know what he would say.) Options 2-4 are pretty ""meh"", and involve getting both the editor and the dissenting author on board. So given that these three options involve convincing two people, anyway, it may be worthwhile to look at other solutions involving communications.


How deeply have you discussed the putative error with the dissenting author? It may be easier to convince him that there is an error than to convince both him and the editor to collaborate on a ""solution"" nobody is happy with.
How sure are you that in fact there is an error? I'd assume the dissenting author is not completely out of his mind, so perhaps he does have a point?


Options 4 and 5 really involve taking the time to discuss the issue in depth with the dissenting author. I'd recommend doing this in person, if at all possible, not via email or the phone. And do this one-on-one with the dissenter, not together with all the other authors - if he perceives everyone else ""ganging up"" on him, he may become defensive.

Approach this with an open mind. Maybe there is a simple misunderstanding, and the two of you are really thinking of different things when you think you are talking about the same thing. Often you will learn a lot from this kind of discussion. In the best possible case, you will find two different ways of looking at the issue, and maybe even the germ of a follow-up paper.


If all else fails and the editor is in fact an associate editor, you can always escalate the issue to the chief editor.

3864,3864,6151,How to set A Records and MX records correctly,"I just wanted to confirm something if that's okay? :) I am setting up a new site for someone and they already have email configured on an existing server and want the website on a different one. They have already set the www a record to the new server IP and this works fine and they have two MX records setup and the email is working fine. They have not updated the @ A Record, this is still pointing to the mail server IP (which means the non www version of the site goes there instead). Am i not right in thinking that if you have the MX records set then the A Records for both www and @ can be set to a different server IP and will have no impact on the email (as this will be controlled purely by the MX records)? So I can change the @ a record to the new server ip as well and this won't affect their email right? Assuming this is okay will it screw up the RDNS or any of the other email validation techniques?

I'd also try to deduce which tables are lookup tables, which ones are mana-to-many intermediate tables, etc and lay out the entities such that these roles are obvious to a person looking at the diagram.

J. A. Simpson, The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Proverbs (1982) offers this lineage for the proverb:


  All's fair in love and war

'Do you really suppose I would tell?' he demanded coldly. 'Might do. All's fair in——.'


But between Shelton in 1620 and James in 1845, an interesting alternative commentary on love and war was developing in North America. From Bartlett Whiting, Early American Proverbs and Proverbial Phrases (1977):


  L230 In Love and war no time should be lost
  
  1777 Munford Patriots 451: In love and war no time should be lost. 1784 Washington Writings 28.2: Favorable moments in war, as in love, once lost are seldom regained.


Martin Manser, The Facts on File Dictionary of Proverbs (2002) cites the Smedley quotation from 1850 as the first instance of the proverb in its current standard form, but then notes:


  The proverb was first recorded with different wording, in 1620 [presumably meaning Shelton's translation of Don Quixote]. In modern use an extra word is often added to or substituted for part of the proverb, as in ""All's fair in love—an' war—an' politics"" (George Ade, County Chairman, 1903).


Linda and Roger Flavell, Dictionary of Proverbs and Their Origins (1993) offers this longer view of ""all's fair in love and war"":


  The assumption behind this proverb is that the end justifies the means.This has long been recognized in the theatre of war. Livy hinted at it two millennia ago: To those to whom war is necessary it is just (HISTORY c 10 BC). Courtship, too, may entail the use of any means if one is to emerge victorious and take the prize. These excesses of the heart are considered forgiveable because love has long been understood as a force which cannot be restrained: Both might and malice, deceyte and treacherye, all periurye, anye impietie may lawfully be committed in loue, which is lawlesse (John Lyly, EUPHUES, 1579).
  
  The link between love and fighting for a kingdom was already established in a proverbial form by 1606: An old saw hath bin, Faith's breach for love and kingdoms is no sin (Marston, THE FAWN). Later in the same century Aphra Behn writes: Advantages are lawful in love and war (THE EMPEROR AND THE MOON, 1677). There was also the strong contemporary influence of DON QUIXOTE by Cervantes. Publication of Part One was in 1605 and it was soon translated into English. One passage runs [in Spanish, literally translated, presumably, since this isn't Stewart's language]: Love and war are the same thing, and stratagems and policy are as allowable in the one as in the other.


Rosalind Fergusson, The Facts on File Dictionary of Proverbs (1983)—same title and publisher as Manser's book above, but almost twenty years older and completely different in content—identifies several allied proverbs, though it doesn't identify where these other sayings come from:

5522,5522,8759,How much is too much damage?,"How much damage is too much?

Based on photos I've seen as reference on this forum I'm afraid the damage is more extreme than superficial. Supposedly it happened from one fall.  The bottom side has a hole that's been repaired and the face/soundboard has two cracks below the bridge on either side. It's a TW15H Tanglewood Ill 

Here's the story:
I'm trying to buy my husband a guitar for Christmas. He played in college but has only picked up a guitar a handful of times since we've met. He's 34 now and we have a soon-to-be 2yo son who is captivated by the guitar (and another son due in 2mos). My husband has been hinting on wanting to start playing again so I thought it would be the perfect Christmas gift. 

I don't have much to spend and really don't want an all laminate plastic piece of junk. I don't know much about guitars but I recognize when I hear sound quality I love - rich, full bodied, well balanced sound that resonates with a person.  Not that tinny twang I hear from some guitars without that depth of sound. 

I was at a local music shop this morning that pointed me to a damaged TW15H Tanglewood Ill 
He told me it's solid wood construction with ebony and bone. Sounds beautiful. I believe it was a dreadnought. (Sorry if I sound naive...picture a hugely pregnant lady shopping in a guitar shop with a toddler. I assure you we look as naive as I might sound).  The problem is that the TW15H Tanglewood Ill is damaged. It's been dropped. The face is cracked in 2 places and there was a hole at the bottom. 

If I can post photos here I will. 

The owner has repaired the damage. Says it was his own guitar and he loved it but a friend dropped it soon after it's purchase and despite being repaired he gets upset whenever he sees it and no longer wants it around to remind him. The damage is quite visible but it sounds lovely. My question is how much damage is too much?  Will it hold a tuning etc? He told me it's a 3000k guitar and is asking $375 for it. I only saved $200 to buy a guitar which I realize is laughable for a decent one. I'm thinking of putting the rest on a credit card if I can find out it's worth it. Can anyone help advise me here?  The shop says he'll back the guitar for a year. 

The other option he suggested was a Sammick - Greg Bennett (which I've never heard of) for $250

I'm trying to decide if I should buy the damaged TW15H Tanglewood Ill or look for a new beginner guitar. 

Please help
",LaRiena Ralph Dobkim,https://music.stackexchange.com/users/16832,"""The owner has repaired the damage"" does not sound reassuring.  Make an appointment with a luthier and ask to lend the guitar out for testing.

Basically there are several questions to ask:


How likely is the guitar to degrade without additional repairs? Over which time span?
This is important because it determines what you need to invest now in order not to make this a waste of money. 
Which repairs would be warranted for securing its state and sound
quality?
This is important for figuring out how much will get dunked into this instrument before it will hold up for a decade or so.
Which repairs would be warranted for getting good looks back?
This will basically only become relevant when your husband falls in love with the instrument to a degree where he would consider a body job for it, and then this should not become similarly expensive as a new one would. 


You really need to get a verdict from a luthier to figure out whether this instrument will hold up and is not substantially worse in its structure due to the damage.

If it's reasonably salvaged, then a $3000 guitar should be quite more enjoyable to play with than a $300 guitar.

But you are not likely to figure this out on your own (and the price ranges of several followup options), and from the description alone, nobody here is going to either.

I don't have much to spend and really don't want an all laminate plastic piece of junk. I don't know much about guitars but I recognize when I hear sound quality I love - rich, full bodied, well balanced sound that resonates with a person.  Not that tinny twang I hear from some guitars without that depth of sound. 

I was at a local music shop this morning that pointed me to a damaged TW15H Tanglewood Ill 
He told me it's solid wood construction with ebony and bone. Sounds beautiful. I believe it was a dreadnought. (Sorry if I sound naive...picture a hugely pregnant lady shopping in a guitar shop with a toddler. I assure you we look as naive as I might sound).  The problem is that the TW15H Tanglewood Ill is damaged. It's been dropped. The face is cracked in 2 places and there was a hole at the bottom. 

If I can post photos here I will. 

The owner has repaired the damage. Says it was his own guitar and he loved it but a friend dropped it soon after it's purchase and despite being repaired he gets upset whenever he sees it and no longer wants it around to remind him. The damage is quite visible but it sounds lovely. My question is how much damage is too much?  Will it hold a tuning etc? He told me it's a 3000k guitar and is asking $375 for it. I only saved $200 to buy a guitar which I realize is laughable for a decent one. I'm thinking of putting the rest on a credit card if I can find out it's worth it. Can anyone help advise me here?  The shop says he'll back the guitar for a year. 

The other option he suggested was a Sammick - Greg Bennett (which I've never heard of) for $250

I'm trying to decide if I should buy the damaged TW15H Tanglewood Ill or look for a new beginner guitar. 

Please help
","""The owner has repaired the damage"" does not sound reassuring.  Make an appointment with a luthier and ask to lend the guitar out for testing.

Basically there are several questions to ask:


How likely is the guitar to degrade without additional repairs? Over which time span?
This is important because it determines what you need to invest now in order not to make this a waste of money. 
Which repairs would be warranted for securing its state and sound
quality?
This is important for figuring out how much will get dunked into this instrument before it will hold up for a decade or so.
Which repairs would be warranted for getting good looks back?
This will basically only become relevant when your husband falls in love with the instrument to a degree where he would consider a body job for it, and then this should not become similarly expensive as a new one would. 


You really need to get a verdict from a luthier to figure out whether this instrument will hold up and is not substantially worse in its structure due to the damage.

If it's reasonably salvaged, then a $3000 guitar should be quite more enjoyable to play with than a $300 guitar.

But you are not likely to figure this out on your own (and the price ranges of several followup options), and from the description alone, nobody here is going to either.

5635,5635,8933,How do you deal with amends from a client?,"I'm a web designer currently working with a very demanding client.

I presented them with designs back in May and I'm still working through amends with them. They are making changes to everything and although I know amends are to be expected, it's really getting to be frustrating. I'm currently working every evening on the list of new amends they have. Tiny things like ""make this blue"" or ""change the width of this"" or ""make this gap smaller"".

I know amends need to be made and that's fine, but how do you handle when there are just too many? I've counted the comments on inVision and there have been 185 amends on 6 pages of a website design. 

Some of them change, and then change again, and then change again and again. For example they wanted to add a strapline, so I added it, adjusted all the menus to accomodate is across the 6 pages. Then they wanted to change the text, so I changed it and updated it across all 6 documents. Now that it's changed, they want to make the menu smaller so now I have to go back and change the menu again.

I quoted based on time I thought it would take to complete the designs with some time for amends but I've more than tripled the time. I haven't explained to them early enough in the process that amends beyond the normal would cost them more so I'm going to have to swallow the cost this time, but should I lay this out better with future clients?

How do you handle amends? Do you put an estimated time on them at the beginning, and then charge more if they go over this? Or do you do something different?
",user1486133,https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/users/46171,"Maybe this can help: 
http://freelancing.stackexchange.com/questions/3226/project-based-freelance-project-requiring-multiple-unexpected-redos-from-clien/3337#3337.

I like to ask a lot of questions before getting started, prepare quick sketches, and split my projects in ""steps""; and then each step gets approved. Once a client goes back, it's a revision that is charged.

I also explain to clients they have to provide their final texts and the images they want to use to avoid revisions.

Always be specific and yes, explain clearly the process before you get started.



But since you're already stuck with this...

When clients are back to using the html site as a ""sketch zone"" as your client does, stop changing the CSS and the html, and go back to using a plan or showing them a JPG of ONE page (or sections of it). Explain them that when you start doing CSS and html, it's not the time to play around and modify things (at least not menus and big changes.) You can be nice and tell them it's for their own good since the coding requires some planning and it avoids mistakes. Don't tell stuff like ""it's easy"", they might end up believing it's truly easy for you.

So take a screenshot of a main page, do the changes in Photoshop or Illustrator or Indesign, and show them a JPG ""proof"" that they will approve. Have the main layout approved first, not all 6 pages!

On your proof, add a mention about ""any changes after this is approved will be charged at XX/hour"". And instead of sending that proof by email, host it somewhere and send them an url; this way it will appear at 100% in their browser and they'll have a better idea of what to expect. 

Personally, I like to present them 2-4 options; this way they can say they like the menu of A, the body font of B and the footer of C for example. Then I present them another set of proofs with the elements they preferred, and other options if necessary. Usually it ends up limiting the possible requests they might have because you showed them pretty much everything possible at this point! Your proofs don't need to be perfect, they're like a sketch; just do some copy/paste and move things around.

Once it's approved, you can go back to coding. If you have to come back again to ""sketching"" or modify your code, start charging at hourly rate. 

You need to do something like this otherwise they'll keep going until december 2016 if they get all that free work from you and if you don't require them to fully approve some of your work. Right now, they're not taking any decision.



PS: I don't like using design software to do sketches of the websites, and I'm sure you don't either. It's way simpler sometimes to do it straight in CSS but... the reason why you're doing this is not so much to make it faster to do the website but to make your client feel like you're also making them go back to step 1! All they want in the end is to have their website done; when you go back to showing them JPGs, they get a bit less excited and you get back some control on the situation. 

They will approve your JPGs proofs faster than the real website you're showing them because they will want to see the result ""live"" as soon as possible.

Since I got my Kindle I have not read a single paper novel; they have fewer drawbacks compared to digital copies than rpg rulebooks.


Dead-tree types have some benefits like looking good on a bookshelf, but any ebook reader weighs less with 100 novels than the usual hard-cover book. 
If you want to look for the damage of Ares Alpha, even with a half-decent tablet it takes less than 2 seconds.  
Digital copies do not get worn, they never get unwanted earmarks, but you can bookmark them.
Rulebooks do get updates, and unless you are willing to take a pen to your book, your hard copies will never contain them. The pdfs can be edited and resent to the buyers. 
Even better is the WotC approach with the DDI, you can look up any monster or item or (almost any) rule, in the most recent form, for 3 years at the cost of seven books.

Since I got my Kindle I have not read a single paper novel; they have fewer drawbacks compared to digital copies than rpg rulebooks.


Dead-tree types have some benefits like looking good on a bookshelf, but any ebook reader weighs less with 100 novels than the usual hard-cover book. 
If you want to look for the damage of Ares Alpha, even with a half-decent tablet it takes less than 2 seconds.  
Digital copies do not get worn, they never get unwanted earmarks, but you can bookmark them.
Rulebooks do get updates, and unless you are willing to take a pen to your book, your hard copies will never contain them. The pdfs can be edited and resent to the buyers. 
Even better is the WotC approach with the DDI, you can look up any monster or item or (almost any) rule, in the most recent form, for 3 years at the cost of seven books. 


I think this is the way to go, even considering the horribly slow character builder. Although I must admit good illustration can help build the athmosphere.

So what am I missing? Why are people buying rpg rulebooks in paper format? Why are books even published, I do not need to know if feats are supposed to be on the right page and skills on the left, I just want a list of them, filterable any way I want. 

Is this just a necessary part of earning money? I understand that pdfs are copied illegally, but the Compendium is not.

3220,3220,5138,How can I get a UIWebView's UIScrollView delegate methods called from within a standard UIViewController?,"So I just have a standard UIViewController with a UIWebView in it that displays a pdf. For the app functionality, I have need to be able to respond to the UIWebView's nested UIScrollView events like scrollViewWillBeginDragging, scrollViewDidScroll, etc. 

The only way I can get access to the scrollView is to (it seems like a hack) go in and get it by the subviews array:

for (id subview in webView.subviews){
    if ([[subview class] isSubclassOfClass: [UIScrollView class]])  {
        UIScrollView * s = (UIScrollView*)subview;
        s.delegate = self;
        s.tag = 1;
        scrollView = s;
    }
}


But that seems to introduce more problems than it's worth, because I lose native UIScrollView stuff like zooming.

So to sum up what I'm needing:

What is the best way to set my UIViewController class as the delegate of the UIScrollView inside of the UIWebView? Is there something I need to do with subclassing my own UIWebView so that it handles events from it's built in UIWebView a certain way and then pass it along somehow to the UIViewController? How does that passing thing work anyway?

Please advise!

Thank you!

Have you checked there is only one UIScrollView subclass in the subviews? Bung in a log in your loop to see. If there is more than one, then you'll only pick up the last one using your code.
If there is just one UIScrollView subclass, you could try saving a reference to its delegate and then in your own delegate methods passing messages on after you have done your business.


So, in your loop, something like

originalDelegate = s.delegate


And then for the delegate methods, something like:

- (void) scrollViewDidScroll: (UIScrollView*) scrollView;
{
     // do your stuff

     [originalDelegate scrollViewDidScroll: scrollView];
}


You might need to check whether originalDelegate responds to the selector before calling it, i.e. if ([originalDelegate respondsToSelector: @selector(scrollViewDidScroll:)) etc. If it were me, I'd start by implementing all twelve delegate methods defined in the UIScrollView delegate protocol.

Not tested this, so will be interested to know if it can be made to work. Do note, the docs explicitly say that UIWebView ""should not be subclassed""

",Bryan Boettcher,https://programmers.stackexchange.com/users/17309,"The only pattern I can see is that you have either letters followed by digits, or digits followed by letters, or letters only.

From this point, the first step would be to separate the string into the beginning and the end, then to separate each part into a group of one or two entities:

""AB12-ZZ789"" → [""AB12"", ""ZZ789""] → [[""AB"", ""12""], [""ZZ"", ""789""]]


The numeric entities can be then converted to numbers:

[[""AB"", ""12""], [""ZZ"", ""789""]] → [[""AB"", 12], [""ZZ"", 789]]


Then, letters can be converted to their respective numeric representation. For example, if ""A"" is mapped to 0, ""B"" - to 1, etc., ""AB"" is 0 × 26 + 1, while ""ZZ"" is 25 × 26 + 25.

[[""AB"", 12], [""ZZ"", 789]] → [[26, 12], [675, 789]]


Once you do this conversion, it's pretty simple to know if the value is in a range. For example,

""HC52"" → [""HC"", ""52""]
       → [""HC"", 52]
       → [(7 × 26 + 2), 52]
       → [184, 52]


26 ≤ 184 ≤ 675 and 12 ≤ 52 ≤ 789, so the value is in the range.

""HC999"" → [""HC"", ""999""]
        → [""HC"", 999]

Areas of Concern

I noticed in my query that if I try to execute the SQL with:

$stmt-&gt;execute( array(':start'=&gt;$pages-&gt;limit_start,':end'=&gt;$pages-&gt;limit_end) );


I get an error unless I also use $conn-&gt;setAttribute(PDO::ATTR_EMULATE_PREPARES, FALSE);. However I can get around that if I use bindParam instead:

$stmt-&gt;bindParam(':start', $pages-&gt;limit_start, PDO::PARAM_INT);
$stmt-&gt;bindParam(':end', $pages-&gt;limit_end, PDO::PARAM_INT);
$stmt-&gt;execute();


Should I be using $conn-&gt;setAttribute(PDO::ATTR_EMULATE_PREPARES, FALSE); or the separate bindParam calls?bindParam seems like a decent solution, whereas using ATTR_EMULATE_PREPARESseems a little hacky.

Within the class, am I setting the visibility (public, private, protected) of my parameters and methods properly?

If you see anything that jumps out at you like ""what in the world was he thinking?"", you can assume that I was dealing with something I hadn't done before. Any tips or suggestions overall would be appreciated.
",j08691,https://codereview.stackexchange.com/users/10068,"Okay, I’m going to list anything and everything that came in my mind while reading your code.


Start documenting your code for better maintainability
Validate every and any user input
Use proper camelCase notation for property and method names
Separate your code into more methods (especially in __construct)
Keep everything protected unless you have a good reason to keep it private or expose it with public
Use single or double quotes throughout your code, but don’t mix it (consistency)
Enclose your variables in {} if you embed them in strings
Use single quotes for your HTML if you use double quotes for creating the string (prevent escaping mistakes)
Use namespace’s (even if you don’t need them now)

That's stuff you often see in OO PHP code, wrapping some other classes and trying to make some real OO code out of them. But what I really want to show you is the fact that the methods are short, easy to understand because of that and that you already know what each method does only by reading their name.

Areas of Concern

I noticed in my query that if I try to execute the SQL with:

$stmt-&gt;execute( array(':start'=&gt;$pages-&gt;limit_start,':end'=&gt;$pages-&gt;limit_end) );


I get an error unless I also use $conn-&gt;setAttribute(PDO::ATTR_EMULATE_PREPARES, FALSE);. However I can get around that if I use bindParam instead:

$stmt-&gt;bindParam(':start', $pages-&gt;limit_start, PDO::PARAM_INT);
$stmt-&gt;bindParam(':end', $pages-&gt;limit_end, PDO::PARAM_INT);
$stmt-&gt;execute();


Should I be using $conn-&gt;setAttribute(PDO::ATTR_EMULATE_PREPARES, FALSE); or the separate bindParam calls?bindParam seems like a decent solution, whereas using ATTR_EMULATE_PREPARESseems a little hacky.

Within the class, am I setting the visibility (public, private, protected) of my parameters and methods properly?

If you see anything that jumps out at you like ""what in the world was he thinking?"", you can assume that I was dealing with something I hadn't done before. Any tips or suggestions overall would be appreciated.
","Okay, I’m going to list anything and everything that came in my mind while reading your code.


Start documenting your code for better maintainability
Validate every and any user input
Use proper camelCase notation for property and method names
Separate your code into more methods (especially in __construct)
Keep everything protected unless you have a good reason to keep it private or expose it with public
Use single or double quotes throughout your code, but don’t mix it (consistency)
Enclose your variables in {} if you embed them in strings
Use single quotes for your HTML if you use double quotes for creating the string (prevent escaping mistakes)
Use namespace’s (even if you don’t need them now)

"
5947,5947,9423,How to merge unversioned code into Git repository?,"So a friend worked on a bunch of code that he never versioned, and is handing it off to me. He initially gave me version A, even though he had a more recent version B available. I put A into a git repository (on say Team Foundation Service), and then made some commits, resulting in version C. Now he has put up version B in a git repository (on say Bitbucket). How can I compare versions C and B, and merge all diffs between (B,A) and (C,A) to get one final version D which has both his updates and mine? Keep in mind, the repos on Bitbucket and TFS (versions B and C respectively) have no common git commits, although they both come off the same base version A.

I can see a couple of ways of doing this, not sure of the cons of each though:
1) Add Bitbucket version B as an upstream to my TFS version C, and fetch upstream/master, then do a git diff.
2) Copy the files from version B into the directory that holds version C, and then commit them as if I changed the files manually.
3) Something else entirely, like rebase.

My understanding of git is very basic so please explain like I'm 5 (well, not really, but you know what I mean).

Note: It is ok to have all changes made from A to B in one commit in the final repo history, but would be nice to preserve the individual commits between A and C.

Also, from version A to version B, the friend has not maintained directory structure, he has moved all the contents to a sub-directory of the root. So if version A had file a.txt, version B has file TRUNK/a.txt.
",Neil,https://stackoverflow.com/users/181284,"Simply:


checkout A
make a new branch from A
 (from ""Git version control and Team Foundation Build"")
copy B in it
add and commit:
 (from ""Create, Connect, and Publish using Visual Studio with Git"")

He initially gave me version A, even though he had a more recent version B available. I put A into a git repository (on say Team Foundation Service), and then made some commits, resulting in version C. Now he has put up version B in a git repository (on say Bitbucket). How can I compare versions C and B, and merge all diffs between (B,A) and (C,A) to get one final version D which has both his updates and mine? Keep in mind, the repos on Bitbucket and TFS (versions B and C respectively) have no common git commits, although they both come off the same base version A.

I can see a couple of ways of doing this, not sure of the cons of each though:
1) Add Bitbucket version B as an upstream to my TFS version C, and fetch upstream/master, then do a git diff.
2) Copy the files from version B into the directory that holds version C, and then commit them as if I changed the files manually.
3) Something else entirely, like rebase.

My understanding of git is very basic so please explain like I'm 5 (well, not really, but you know what I mean).

Note: It is ok to have all changes made from A to B in one commit in the final repo history, but would be nice to preserve the individual commits between A and C.

Also, from version A to version B, the friend has not maintained directory structure, he has moved all the contents to a sub-directory of the root. So if version A had file a.txt, version B has file TRUNK/a.txt.
","Simply:


checkout A
make a new branch from A
 (from ""Git version control and Team Foundation Build"")
copy B in it
add and commit:
 (from ""Create, Connect, and Publish using Visual Studio with Git"")
merge that branch in your main branch which represents C

5417,5417,8602,Bordermatrix without brackets,"I am hanging on this one since yesterday and was not able to find an example nor anything in the documentation --- maybe I am blind?

What i want is a matrix with border annotations BUT without the brackets (neither round nor squared nor curled, each of which have been discussed here). I also want to make the bordertext (A-E) bold and italic on the X and the Y axis... 

I have some code to construct the matrix as I have it right now:
