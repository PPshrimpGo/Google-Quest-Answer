It returns all 3 menu elements for your sample data. You can use projection to get anonymous object instead of XElement:

var menus = doc.Root

2352,2352,3749,Does a terminator have a form of self-preservation or prohibition against suicide?,"This weekend I was watching Terminator 2 (editor cut). In the end, after T-1000 is destroyed, Arnold asks Sarah and John to destroy him by melting and says ""I cannot destroy myself"".

So, what does this mean? The terminator cannot destroy himself unless it is absolutely necessary in order to succeed in his mission (like protect John?)?

In that case, what was the Terminator in part 1 going to do after the success of his mission (i.e. destroy Sarah)? Just live a long happy life and wait for Skynet arise?

Update:
I understand that this is not the exact Third law of Asimov, since the terminators definitely don't follow the First or Second law. Let's call it the law of self-preservation. Does terminator have a form of self-preservation to some point and the prohibition of suicide?
",SPIRiT_1984,https://scifi.stackexchange.com/users/4435,"In the book version, the Terminator does indeed terminate itself.

However, regarding the movie: It says (1:30) ""I cannot self-terminate"" (emphasis by me). This is different from ""I mustn't self-terminate"" or ""I may not self-terminate"", which could be read as: It's not forbidden for it to terminate itself, but it simply does not have the ability to do it.

This is a bit argumentative, because from the fact that it knows how to terminate a T-1000 you may assume that it could terminate a hostile T-800 as well, and it seems intelligent enough to realise that it is a T-800 as well meaning that the same means would have to be taken to terminate itself than a different T-800.



A completely different (albeit quite far fetched) explanation might be that this is a way to ensure that its missions are carried out. From a model checking point of view all assignments could be solved most easily by self-termination (inaction is the safest option).

Inside the Theme Customizer I see the (default) image displayed as:


The ""Current Header"" box, and 
In the ""Suggested"" box

I deleted the current header image by clicking the ""Hide Image"" button.


And this is where the problem started 

When I attempt to re-add the default image by clicking on the ""Suggested"" (i.e. default) image...


The image is displayed in the customizer window.
But the image will not save, so the image does not display on the web page.


A var_dump( get_header_image() ); returned false, so after reading the function in the core, I see this if ( 'remove-header' == $url ) return false;. 

So a var_dump( get_theme_mods() ) does indeed show 'header_image' =&gt; string 'remove-header' (length=13). 

???

To quote Mehrdad: You're basically comparing an intermolecular force with an intramolecular force.

Ionic bonds are two charged atoms sitting next to each other with minimal overlap of their orbitals.

Covalents bonds are two atoms becoming one molecule with significant changes in orbital structure. 

It is not always clear cut: there are atoms with part-ionic and part-covalent character or two atoms sitting next to each other with moderate overlap of their orbitals. 

Here is a good explanation (for solids): Are metallic/ionic bonds weaker than covalent bonds? I was taught the opposite. Now I&#39;m confused

Long answer:

Electrostatic bonds by definition are incapable of any significant bond formation. Bond formation involves the formation of a lower energy ""bonding orbital(s)"" out of two (or more) higher energy ordinary orbitals on adjacent atoms within the molecule. The formation of bonding orbitals gives covalent bonding orbitals much lower energy (not smaller, see diagram) than non-bonding orbitals which exist in the unbound state. This energy difference is larger than is possible for merely electrostatic attractions. Why is this the case? Because the electrons in bonding orbital are better able to counteract the positive charges of the adjacent nuclei. This makes sense because the negative charge on one molecule in an electrostatic arrangement is only able to neutralize the positive charge from its own nuclei. Bonding orbitals that are only present in covalent bonds share those electrons between two nuclei and thereby better neutralize the charges of both nuclei, which results in a lower energy for the bonded system than is possible in an ionic system.

333,333,533,Is OTP useful in modern electronic communication?,"I have seen from time to time questions about various OTP schemes and ""OTP"" (i.e. stream cipher) schemes. The most common OTP troubles appear to be:


How to extend size of previously generated key or how to generate key.
How to get key material securely to the recipient.


In electronic communication or storage encryption OTP appears scheme that is impossible to make work and if it works benefits are not clear. Requirement that the key needs to be the same size than input seems to be unbearable for many of modern use cases for encryption.

Is there any practice where OTP is useful in modern cryptography except:


As a component used on some proofs.
As a example ideal of encryption algorithm.


I.e.: Is it possible to base on OTP and provide the ""information theoretic"" strength to hashing (apparently not), authentication, etc.
",user4982,https://crypto.stackexchange.com/users/4982,"The OTP is more a theoretical construction than a real world construction. The OTP suffers from three core problems:


Key Generation.
Key Distribution.
Key Destruction.


Let's deal with each one in turn.

Key Generation 

Key generation is surprisingly difficult. In order to get the full security proof for the OTP, you need to each bit to be independent of every other bit and for there to be no bias whatsoever in the output.

Now practically every hardware RNG you're going to get does not fufil this in practice. They almost always run the bits through a hash function or some sort of entropy extraction routine. However, these routines do not carry a security proof that they preserve the underlying independent non-bias nature of the bits passed to them. 

It's quite possible that if you the entropy extraction routine over enough bits, that a very small bias would be observed. However, any such bias, no matter how small would destroy the OTP security proof. 

So you need to design your own RNG using only de-biasing techniques that maintain the security proof. Worse, you need to build an RNG with no detectable bias whatsoever over gigabits of output. 

Key Distribution 

Key distribution is a pain because the key has to be as long as the message. This immediately raises the question of why bother with encryption if you already have a secure channel of transmitting the key. Even with this massive key you haven't authenticated the cipher-text! You need provisions for that too.

This limits the OTP to scenarios where you want to time-shift a secure channel. It works okay in scenarios like the following. If Alice lives in Hong Kong and Bob lives in New York, they can meet twice a year and exchange a gigabyte or two of pad and be on their way.

Even if you're using QKD you've just moved the problem elsewhere. The problem now moves from a key distribution problem to an engineering problem. You've got to make a QKD device that is 100% reliable, doesn't have any side channel attacks, and is not susceptible to induced errors. Such as slightly overpowering/underpowering device to get duplicate photons, shinning a laser at the device to subtly break it or some other error inducing attack. 

You've got many of the same problems of hardware quality as you had with the PRG. Good luck with that!

Key Destruction

Once you've used the key you have to make sure it is properly destroyed in both places. This is again more tricky than it seems at first. 

If you don't do this properly and you use the key-stream twice, you have no security at all. If the program that manages the pad for you suffers some sort of error and fails to delete the used portion of the pad then re-use becomes quite likely.  

Worse, because the pad is the same length as the message there's quite a lot of key stream to leak. This can leak in a number of ways. Parts of the key stream might have been paged to disk, for example, during encryption/decryption process. 

An attacker could then decipher parts of your ciphertext by simply XORing bytes from your recovered hard-drive against the ciphertext. 

Conclusion

The reason that the OTP isn't really fielded is that despite its strong security proof, the practical considerations around it actually render it insecure. 

This is actually quite common in cryptography. Things with strong security proofs tend to be unworkable.   

For every section of my reply, there is a documented case where precisely the problem I've raised has led to OTP messages being compromised. 

OTPs are really hard to use properly and are typically less secure overall than a conventional scheme. 

Small secrets, by virtue of them being small, are less likely to be leaked, easier to generate, easier to destroy and easier to transmit. All of these properties make them more secure.

Then I start cycling (using my legs...) - the engine starts to rotate, even though I haven't ""started it"" using the switch.

Does it mean that if I press the pedal (or whatever) of the engine, it will apply force? Either on a diesel or a gasoline engine.

Another question: Lets say I'm driving down a hill in a relatively high speed in a car, and I'm not pressing the gas pedal at all. Does the engine burn fuel at all, in both diesel and gas? If I (while in gear) turn off the engine, will something actually happen? If I would press the pedal after turning it off (while it still rotates) - will it apply force? (in both diesel and gas).

If, while driving, I disconnected the idler (i.e the engine won't apply any force if I'm not pressing the pedal at any RPM and pressing the clutch will take it to zero RPM) and press the brake until I get to a complete stop, will the engine ""stall""? If I'm doing it in a hill facing down, after releasing the brakes I'd accelerate and the engine would gain RPMs, will it be able to continue applying force?

It's easier to detect on newer model cars with a digital instant fuel economy gauge where when cruising at 55 MPH and the accelerator pedal is released, the economy readout will shoot from 30 MPG to the highest number or the readout goes blank.

On an automatic transmission when the gear selector is placed in neutral at highway speed, the engine computer will allow the fuel injectors to fire again and actually raises the RPMs in anticipation of it being thrown into gear again.

",kishore,https://mechanics.stackexchange.com/users/7411,"I take it from the wording, English is not your first language. To answer you outright, there is no reason to mix coolant and oil, under no situation where a vehicle is concerned.

If you are actually asking why oil would be fed through something containing coolant (radiator or such), the reason would be simple in that it is cooling the oil. By cooling the oil, the oil will stay viable longer as well as it will not want to build up sludge as much. It will also be able to cool the engine better, which means the engine itself will last longer. Using an oil cooler works especially well for supercharged or turbo-charged engines.

1601,1601,2517,Is conditional compilation a valid mock/stub strategy for unit testing?,"In a recent question on stubbing, many answers suggested C# interfaces or delegates for implementing stubs, but one answer suggested using conditional compilation, retaining static binding in the production code.  This answer was modded -2 at the time of reading, so at least 2 people really thought this was a wrong answer.  Perhaps misuse of DEBUG was the reason, or perhaps use of fixed value instead of more extensive validation.  But I can't help wondering:

Is the use of conditional compilation an inappropriate technique for implementing unit test stubs?  Sometimes?  Always?

Thanks.

Edit-add:  I'd like to add an example as a though experiment:

class Foo {
    public Foo() { .. }
    private DateTime Now { 
      get {
#if UNITTEST_Foo
        return Stub_DateTime.Now;
#else
        return DateTime.Now;
#endif
      }
    }
    // .. rest of Foo members
}


comparing to

interface IDateTimeStrategy { 
    DateTime Now { get; }
}
class ProductionDateTimeStrategy : IDateTimeStrategy {
  public DateTime Now { get { return DateTime.Now; } }
}
class Foo {
    public Foo() : Foo(new ProductionDateTimeStrategy()) {}
    public Foo(IDateTimeStrategy s) { datetimeStrategy = s; .. }
    private IDateTime_Strategy datetimeStrategy;
    private DateTime Now { get { return datetimeStrategy.Now; } }
}


Which allows the outgoing dependency on ""DateTime.Now"" to be stubbed through a C# interface.  However, we've now added a dynamic dispatch call where static would suffice, the object is larger even in the production version, and we've added a new failure path for Foo's constructor (allocation can fail).  

Am I worrying about nothing here?  Thanks for the feedback so far!

488,488,762,Can monsters make multiple attacks in a single action?,"In the bestiary for the new D&amp;D Next playtest packets, some creatures look as though they get multiple attacks per round.


  e.g.: An owl bear gets Melee Attack: Claws +5/+5 (etc.) and Bite +5 (etc.) along with a special power says that if both claw attacks hit,
  then extra damage is done.


However, the basic rules don't seem to cover this situation. I can't tell if the owlbear is able to use both claws AND bite in one action, or if it can only use one claw OR a bite, or 2 claws OR A bite.

So, do monsters get multiple attacks per action? And what are the rules for the owl bear, or other monsters that have a +x/+x description for an attack?

By using the constraint instead of direct parenting you can control some of this behaviour. By turning off the scale options you can stop the lightsaber scaling with your armature.



This does highlight one point though, you have an armature that is scaled, you most likely scaled the armature while in object mode to get it to fit your model. Having an armature that is scaled can cause odd behaviour like this at times so you may want to apply the scale to your armature by pressing CtrlA and choosing scale while in object mode.

The plugin is for mass mailing, i.e. mailing to all subscribers, on schedule etc. It registers a custom post type for mail templates, with add new and edit capabilities, and it adds its own menu to the bottom of the admin menu, currently with two submenu pages: 'settings' and 'send mail'.

I created the new content type with two fields. field_offeringlink and field_offeringtext. Where the the text would be the actuall promotional text and the link directing to the sub-page.

I use credit cards (primarily the more recent one) for routine monthly expenses and I pay them off in full every month and reap the rewards.  The limits were pretty low while I was in school, but every 6 months or so they would notify me that they were raising my credit limit by a modest amount.  This continued for a while, but it stopped not long after I left school (which roughly coincided with banks becoming more reluctant to offer credit).

My income has increased several hundred percent over what it was while I was in grad school, and I feel my credit limits do not reflect that.  My combined credit limit between the two cards is a little over 12% of my yearly gross income.  I feel this is probably low, and I might like to increase it both to increase my credit score and to easier allow for multiple large purchases (computer, furniture, etc.) in the same month without using an excessively high portion of my available credit.

This continued for a while, but stopped shortly after I left school (roughly in line with the growing reluctance of banks to provide credit).","I think it would be hard to make the decision based on your credit score, b/c there are always different answers about what affects, and how much. If you don't make big mistakes, like defaulting, I'm sure your credit score will take care of itself.

If you feel like you want more flexibility in your limits, then call and see what you can get. I have around 6 cards, at least 2 have limits over 10k, and my credit score has been over 800 for years. I've opened and closed various cards, and had limits rise over the years and haven't been constrained in getting mortgage or refinancing.

5462,5462,8671,PDFNet SDK Convert files on Azure storage,"I have a web app that needs to convert PDFs to XODs (PDFTron’s format to display documents in their WebViewer). My Web App is hosted on Azure, the PDFs are on Azure Storage. We would like to go along with the on-premises conversion via PDFNet SDK (http://www.pdftron.com/webviewer/getstarted.html, see “Choosing a deployment model for conversions), my code so far is the following: 

WebRequest req = HttpWebRequest.Create(""url of PDF on Azure Storage here"");                         
using (Stream stream = req.GetResponse().GetResponseStream())
{
    PDFDoc pdfdoc = new PDFDoc(stream);
    var converted = pdftron.PDF.Convert.ToXod(pdfdoc);
    //pdfdoc.Save(stream, pdftron.SDF.SDFDoc.SaveOptions.e_linearized); //not clear to me
}


My approach here is to create a stream from the file on azure storage and convert that stream to XOD. I still don’t know if I should call “Save” and in that case where the file would be saved.
My questions are:


Since everything runs on the cloud does it make sense to use the CloudAPI instead of the self-hosted solution or does it not make any difference?
In both cases, where is the converted file stored (since I am getting it from the Azure storage and not from a local server), since I would then need to move it to my azure storage account. Does the file get saved locally (meaning on the web/worker role which is processing it) and therefore needs to be moved to the storage?

http://www.conversantmedia.com/solutions/enterprise-solutions

From what I can tell its pretty straight forward tracking, like google re-marketing, you pass them the information you want to via some javascript, and they target your visitors with targeted ads you have set up.

The main issue I have is they require us to point two cnames at their system to allow for ""First Party Cookies"". 

I know this means all cookies would have to be changed to www.foobar.com, instead of foobar.com, to avoid any issues with information being possible exposed to their end.

But more I was wondering what type of attacks this could open us up to if they had a security issue, if this is more or less secure than google's re-marketings model, and what issues could this cause for us with PCI compliance?

PS We use Braintree and Braintree.js so we are just covered under PCI for handling of Tokens, if that matters at all.

5618,5618,8911,How does an embryo know where to grow limbs etc,"For example you have a cell or already a bunch of cells. Those cell(s) divide and after several week you have a grown organism, for example a human with limbs, several different organs etc. 
However, how do cells know where up, down, left, right etc. is?

It's a bit old (2000), but much of the information is still relevant. You can search this textbook for specific terms but not browse.

There is also a collaborative science/fashion project between the Storey sisters, called Primitive Streak, which documents the early stages of human development.

For any given developmental process, there are a number of genes being activated and/or inactivated at that stage that determine how and when structures grow. Events can determine axes too; for instance, the dorsal/ventral axis of the embryo is determine by how the embryo blastocyst implants in the uterine wall. The left-right axis of the body is determined by the direction that fluid travels through a structure called the node, which is directed by hair-like structures called cilia. If nodal flow is backwards, your internal organs will switch sides, called situs inversus.

Back to the limb example... in tetrapods, or animals with 4 limbs, the area where limbs emerge is based on Hox gene expression, and whether or not it will become a forelimb (arms) or hindlimb (legs) is determined by either Tbx5 or Tbx4 gene expression, respectively.

The proximal-distal axis (proximal = towards the trunk; distal = away from the trunk) is determined by FGF gene expression, which induces formation of a structure called the apical ectodermal ridge (AER).

The anterior-posterior axis (head to tail) is determined by Sonic hedgehog gene expression in a region called the zone of polarizing activity (ZPA).

The dorsal-ventral axis (back-front; or back of the hand/arm - palm/inside of arm) is determined by the Wnt7a gene being expressed on the dorsal side.

The outgrowth of the limb is determined by Hox gene expression.

Digit (finger) formation is dependent on cell death between the fingers - hands start webbed, kind of like ducks, and then genes such as the BMPs cause cells between the fingers to die.

for example excel file generated name is trial.xls

Now if you want to generate pdf of that excel file then do the following :

from win32com import client
xlApp = win32com.client.Dispatch(""Excel.Application"")
books = xlApp.Workbooks.Open('C:\\excel\\trial.xls')
ws = books.Worksheets[0]
ws.Visible = 1
ws.ExportAsFixedFormat(0, 'C:\\excel\\trial.pdf')

1138,1138,1782,Slowdown in large perl array,"I'm currently running a perl program where I have to take a 1 million line text file, break it down into chunks (anywhere between 50 and 50,000 lines per chunk), and run some calculations and such on them.  Right now, I load all of the data into array1.  I take array2 and use it to pull just the chunks of data I need.  I then do what I need to perform on array 2, and then go back and grab the next set.

example data

A, blah1, blah2

A, blah6, blah7

A, blah4, blah5

B, blah2, blah2

So I would grab the first three into array 2, sort them, then move on to the next set. My program works pretty well and efficiently to begin with, but it experiences a severe slowdown later on.

50K takes 50 seconds, 100k takes 184 seconds, 150k takes 360 seconds, 200k takes 581 seconds, and it only gets exponentially worse as the program continues (4500 seconds at line 500k)

2384,2384,3804,Why does my bike make a noise when I pedal hard?,"When I pedal forcing a little with my right leg, the bike makes a noise that I don't know how to describe. I'll try to do it. It's like:


a short ""ting""
a tiny bell
if a small rock hits the down tube


I don't know what is causing this noise, but I think that it could be any of this things:


pedal
crank arm/pedal connection
crankset


I think the material of all these things is alluminium.

I don't feel anything (like a bad shifted chain) when I hear the noise.

It happens when there is movement and when there is NO movement (I use the brake, so the bike doesn'e move, stand using all weight on right pedal, and it makes the noise)

The pedals could be in any position, It is not in a particular position. Just pressing the right pedal.

Has someone else has this ""problem""? Any ideas of where this comes from?

Update:
Yesterday I took out the chain and stood on the right pedal, and made the noise. Then is not the chain, nor the transmission system.

I put oil in the pedal axis, but had no luck. Also tried to loose the pedal, but the juncture point is too tight, and I couldn't.

Today I will try to use oil in the bottom bracket.

Update: here is a link to info on the bike http://www.diamondback.com/2012-sorrento maybe it helps to know the model of all the components.

1977,1977,3151,Understanding of Relays and associated circuitry,"I needed a simple understanding of how this circuit works.



I understand everything about this circuit apart from the diode. I also know the function of the diode is to protect the transistor but from what exactly? Is it something to do with back EMF from the coil? I'm not too sure. Also I needed to confirm if the relay will function correctly with a 9V supply (regulated or unregulated). The datasheet of the relay is attached here and the part I'm going to use is '40.61' on page 20 of the datasheet.

Also any tips for making this circuit work more efficiently. Note I am going to use the relay for no more than 16A at 230VAC at 50Hz.

1871,1871,2972,Georeferencing uneven/irregularly gridded rasters,"I'm trying to take a set of NetCDFs and turn them into georeferenced datasets using GDAL.

However, the only Geospatial data is a set of 2-D lat/lon arrays. The projection type is not lat/lon. THe arrays give the lat/lon of every individual cell.

I can't use a geotransform to reference the data because of the irregular gridding.

How can I create a dataset (such as a GeoTiff) that properly references the data? Ideally I would then warp to some even grid.

EDIT: I tried using an even spread of Ground Control Points, but the resulting GeoTiff did not display correctly... Despite giving GCPs up to 90 deg lat, ArcMap claims the GTiff has an extent ending at 70 deg latitude...

EDIT: Thanks to everyone for their help. I was able to solve the issue using gdalwarp -geoloc as  suggested. I created 3 VRTs (1 with cell values, 1 with latitude, 1 with longitude), and wrote the lat/lon vrts in a geoarrays in the data vrt metadata. Then using gdalwarp -geoloc worked like a charm.

The issue with extent was unrelated and due simply to the large difference between the original coordinate system and lat/lon. It was solved by explicitely stating the extent instead of having GDAL try to guess what it should be. (i.e. I added -te -180 0 180 90 to the gdalwarp line)

Thanks everyone!

1140,1140,1786,Cross-Correlation to find the similartity of songs,"I have been working on a problem where I am given two songs which are of the same category but there is a time difference between them. Eg. one song starts at x sec and other song starts at y sec. So my task is to find the x and y.
The length of the two songs can vary but the content of the two songs will remain the same.  

Currently I am using cross-correlation using FFT for finding the offset between them but it is not giving me correct results.  

For making the length of signals same I am zero padding the signal which is shorter in length. 

Can someone guide me what I am doing wrong in this problem ?

I really appreciate your responses.
Thanks

--

Thanks guys for replying.. 
I am doing in Python and using below algorithm for finding the offset:
1. Using librosa.load function to get the audio signals of both the songs.
2. Then I zero pad the shorter signal from last and make sure it is power of 2.
3. Find the FFT of the two signals using scipy library function of python.(spipy.fftpack.fft)
4. Once I get the fft , I take the cojugate of one of the signals.
5. Elementwise multiplication of the two fft signals
6. Doing ifft of the numpy array of the output signals after multiplication.
7. Finding the peak index of that array.

P.S. The song length can be around 5-6 mins so I am sampling at the rate of 44.1Khz . So you can expect very large sample space.
Also , the bitrate of the two songs can be different.(I am not sure that will effect it or not)

Any idea if I am doing wrong?

2959,2959,4706,Probability density function with conditional distribution and correlation,"I am unsure with question c/d/e/f but I will give my answers for all questions I have attempted.

The random variables $X$ and $Y$ have joint probability density function

$f_{X,Y}(x,y) = ke^{-(x+y)},\ x&gt;0,\ y&gt;0,\ 0&lt;x&lt;y.$

(a) Sketch the region over which the joint probability density function is non-zero.

(b) Show that $k = 2.$

(c) Find the marginal Distribution of $X$; name the distribution and state its mean and variance.

(d) Find the conditional distribution of $Y|X = x$ for $x&gt;0$. Pay particular attention to the range of $Y$ conditional on $x$.

(e) Calculate $Pr(X + Y&lt;1)$.

(f) Given that $E(Y) = 1.5$ and $Var(Y) = 1.25$, calculate the correlation between $X$ and $Y$.

ANSWERS:

(a) Don't know how to draw on here but it's the area above $y=x$ and $y&gt;0$.

(b) Here I used double integration

$\int_0^\infty \int_0^y ke^{-(x+y)}dxdy = 1$

$\int_0^\infty [-ke^{-(x+y)}]_0^y dy = \int_0^\infty[-ke^{-y}+ke^{-2y}]dy$

$[ke^{-y}-\frac{k}{2}e^{-2y}]_0^\infty = [ke^{-0} - \frac{k}{2}e^{-2\cdot0}]-[ke^{-\infty}-\frac{k}{2}e^{-2\cdot \infty}] = [k - \frac{k}{2}]-[0] = \frac{k}2$

Hence $\frac{k}{2}=1$ and $k=2$

(c) $P_x(x)=\int_yP_{X,Y}(x,y)dy=\int_0^\infty2e^{-(x+y)}dy$

$[-2e^{-(x+y)}]_0^\infty= -2e^{-x}$

Presuming that the integration I have done is correct the marginal distribution of $X$ is $-2e^{-x}$ and hence this is a gamma distribution as the limits are $(0,\infty)$ and it just doesn't match the binomial distribution either.

Gamma distribution: $\frac{1}{\Gamma(\alpha)\cdot \beta^\alpha}\cdot x^{\alpha-1}\cdot e^{-\frac{x}{\beta}}$

Hence $\frac{1}{\Gamma(\alpha)\cdot \beta^\alpha}\cdot x^{\alpha-1}\cdot e^{-\frac{x}{\beta}} = -2e^{-x}$

This is where I have gone wrong as using $\beta = 1$ to leave $e^{-x}$ as that i then need to find:

$\frac{1}{\Gamma(\alpha)\cdot 1^\alpha}\cdot x^{\alpha-1} = -2$ and using $\alpha =1$ to make $x^0$ and getting rid of $x$ but this makes $1=-2$.

(d) unsure how to do this question also.

(e) Adding the line $y=1-x$ to the graph from *(a)*we get a new region to find

$\int_0^1 \int_x^{1-x}2e^{-(x+y)}dydx$

$\int_0^1[-2e^{-(x+y)}]_x^{1-x}dx$

$\int_0^1[(-2e^{-2x})-(-2e^{-1})]dx$

$[e^{-2x}+2xe^{-1}]_0^1$

$e^0 + 0 - e^{-2} + 2e^{-1} = 1-\frac{1}{e^2}+\frac{2}{e}$

Hence $Pr(x+y&lt;1) = 1-\frac{1}{e^2}+\frac{2}{e}$

(f) Unsure how to do.

This is a little more meaningful, but it's not likely to be the deciding factor.  If you have a great application otherwise, nobody will care about an A- or two.

4898,4898,7795,Restoring from BackUp Exec to 2003 Recovery Storage Group,"We seem to have some issue with recovering Exchange 2003 data via BackUp Exec 12.5 to Recovery Storage Group.

We have set-up a dial-tone Exchange database, and now trying to restore latest backup to new recovery group. Problem is, it seems as BackUp Exec recovers the data to the dial-tone database instead of Recovery Group.

There is no way to select destination in BackUp Exec, but I was sure Exchange alone knows where to restore data. I also double-checked the ""this database can be overwritten by restore"" check-boxes on dial-tone and recovery data-bases - it's unchecked on dial-tone, and checked on recovery, as instructed in every article.

Following this guide doesn't seem to help - it still restores to dial-tone:
http://www.symantec.com/business/support/index?page=content&amp;id=TECH29719

P.S.: if this doesn't work, how safe is restoring the backup directly to dial-tone, and just using it as the production data-base from now on?

But while armv6 code will run on the pi 2, as noted here (see ""How much faster is it?""), if you want to realize the full potential of the new cores, you need stuff that was compiled for armv7 (which will not run on the old pi).

I can't see how a negatively charged electron can stay in ""orbit"" around a positively charged nucleus. Even if the electron actually orbits the nucleus, wouldn't that orbit eventually decay? 
I can't reconcile the rapidly moving electrons required by the planetary model with the way atoms are described as forming bonds. If electrons are zooming around in orbits, how do they suddenly ""stop"" to form bonds.

5286,5286,8394,Can monsters make multiple attacks in a single action?,"In the bestiary for the new D&amp;D Next playtest packets, some creatures look as though they get multiple attacks per round.


  e.g.: An owl bear gets Melee Attack: Claws +5/+5 (etc.) and Bite +5 (etc.) along with a special power says that if both claw attacks hit,
  then extra damage is done.


However, the basic rules don't seem to cover this situation. I can't tell if the owlbear is able to use both claws AND bite in one action, or if it can only use one claw OR a bite, or 2 claws OR A bite.

So, do monsters get multiple attacks per action? And what are the rules for the owl bear, or other monsters that have a +x/+x description for an attack?

One possible way to answer this question would be to explain how this worked in earlier editions of D&amp;D. If you can tell from the rules test how this is supposed to work, that would be a better answer.

2458,2458,3921,Triac circuit confusion,"X1Iz.png

I have the following questions about the above circuit:

-Why are we even using a trica/diac combo above. Why would a circuit consisting of just the fuse, switch and primary not be sufficient for charging the battery?

-If we do go ahead with the above combo, what is the use of the resistor/capacitor combo attached in parallel above the triac?

Thanks

",givknow,https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/62399,"As Gabe already indicated, the circuit shown is a standard chopper/dimmer circuit, as is also commonly used in lighting applications. The goal of the circuit is to control the current supplied to the battery, as indicated in the problem statement. To achieve this goal, it does not matter whether one controls the power into the transformer/rectifier combination, or one controls the amount of power going from the rectifier to the battery.

You asked in a comment why you need to reduce the power to the transformer. The easy answer is: Because the problem tells you that the power to the battery should be controlled. The complicated answer involves battery charging algorithms and explains why you would want to control power to the battery. I consider that answer out-of-scope.

You also asked in a comment, why you don't use a simple resistor. That's actually a good question, as a resistor could provide similar results. But the circuit shown is far more efficient. The circuit shown has the pass element, in this case the triac, either open (like an open switch, a very high resistance one can assume to be infinity) or closed (like a closed switch, which can be treated like a short circuit between the terminals as a very coarse approach).


While the triac is turned off, there is no loss (voltage multiplied by current) in the triac, as the current is zero.
While the triac is turned on, there is low loss in the triac, as the voltage is quite low (likely 1 to 2 volts). In the extremely simplified version of a short circuit for the triac after ignition, there would be no loss, as the voltage is zero.


If the output power should be reduced to the half of what you get if the triac circuit was not there, the triac would be on 50% of the time and off 50% of the time.

In a resistor-based solution to that problem, to reduce the current, one would need to permanently remove the excess voltage on the primary side (it would work on the secondary as well) by dropping it across the resistor. In this case, the resistor is the ""pass element"" and has a considerable voltage and current at the same time, so it causes losses. (I.e. the resistor gets hot, and you built yourself not just a battery charger, but also an electric heater).

Basically, what you see in that circuit is a very simple form of a switching or switch-mode power reduction circuit which is more efficient thant the typical linear power reduction methode obtained by using a resistor.

You furthermore ask in your question about the R/C-combination to the right. That combination is a snubber circuit. You need it because every real transformer (and even idealised transformers in most cases) have an inductance. The triac turns off each cycle shortly before the current through the transformer reaches zero. The inductance of the transformer tries to keep the current flowing, and would create the well-known inductive voltage spike if there was no way for the current to go. That's what the capacitor is for: it catches the excess current when the switch is off. The resistor is to waste the energy that comes from the transformer due to its inductance. If it were missing, you would get an LC tank circuit that oscillates (and might cause electo-magnetic interference).

Finally, you might wonder why one would perform power-control on the primary side of the transformer instead of the secondary side. There are two considerations:


The ""diac-triac""-dimmer only works on AC current, as it is about cutting AC line cycles, so you can't put this kind of circuit past the rectifier
The typical diac breakdown voltage is 33V, so to get good performance out of that circuit, you need an input voltage that exceeds 33V significantly. You don't have such high voltages on the secondary side in typical charger applications. Also, losses of the dimmer circuit are dominated by the triac pass voltage, which is not that much dependent on current. So a lower current causes lower losses. As the primary side (typically) operates at a higher voltage, you have less current and thus less losses on the primary side.

2257,2257,3598,How to synchronize actions like jump in multiplayer?,"I am a newbie game developer and I have been researching about multiplayer games. I observed that there's always some latency, the players always get updates from past actions. But there are techniques like dead reckoning to handle the latency. I can predict the movement and make movements smooth. But how would I make actions synchronize like jumping, stopped walking, etc.

Suppose, client A was moving, he was at 100m at 10.2 time with 100m/sec velocity and sended this information. Client B would receive this information somewhat later, let it be 10.4. So at client B, I can use prediction and place client A at 120m. But what if, client made a jump at 110m at 10.3. I can't predict that and since I have been using prediction I can't show client A jump in past.

I may deal with this problem by not sending jump action at all. But what if my game has some voids where players can fall and die. So, If I don't sync jump actions, other players will observe that one player was running then he falls in void and then again appear on the screen destroying the visual engagement. 

Jump is just an example, there might many scenarios where prediction can't work. So, How do deal with them. One such example can be Multiplayer Online battle arena games like Awesomenauts.

Could someone recommend, point me to, or summarize a simple algorithm (pseudo code) that provides some level of basic encryption?

I don't have much experience in this area, but if you can summarize clearly in pseudo-code, I can implement it (don't assume prior knowledge).

It doesn't have to be bullet-proof, but just something that deters the user from understanding the text file. Something more secure than just a simple character-substitution (1 for 1), like perhaps a key that generates a random string used to XOR or similar complexity. I have no idea where to start.

How about pseudo-code for a one-time pad? Or XOR encryption with a key?

3920,3920,6250,How do I set serial special characters?,"In my ongoing quest to interface with some legacy equipment, I've discovered that the vendor supplied software sets the special characters to:

00 00 00 00 11 13 


But the SerialPort class of .NET set them to:

1A 00 00 1A 11 13 


I suppose that I have two questions:


What do these bytes mean?
How can I tell SerialPort to use a specific set of special characters?


The latter is all I really care about, but I suspect the former is going to be useful to know.



Update: The following doesn't work:

byte[] specialchars = {
    0x00,
    0x00,
    0x00,
    0x00,
    0x11,

The first Tadpole object assigned to Tadpole type obviously compiles fine and the call to ribbit() will be to the Tadpole's ribbit() implementation. The second Tadpole object that is created and assigned to a Frog reference. However, the call to ribbit() results in a compiler error. 

I know that if you create a subclass object in the subclass and assign to a superclass reference that is outside of the subclass's package and try to call a superclass method, this is not allowed. But in this case, shouldn't polymorphism make the object reference ""f"" call the Tadpole's ribbit() method since a Tadpole object was assigned to it? Why does this cause a compiler error and why is this is not allowed?

Being rich doesn't mean you are happy.
Being a successful person in life is a big challenge.
Being a doctor doesn't mean you are smart.


The sense of ""being"" at the start of a sentence depends on its context.

In all the sentences being has been used as a gerund. Being rich, being a doctor, and being a successful person are gerund clauses that are subjects of the sentences.

These sentences imply as follows:


If/when you are  rich, it doesn't mean you are happy.
If/when you are a doctor, it doesn't mean you are smart.
It is a big challenge to be a successful person in life.


You can also use to-infinitive instead of being, but the use of the to-infinitive isn't so common.

Besides, in the construct of some sentences, being is also used to express a reason or cause as an alternative to because, since, or as.  For example:

Being the youngest, Sara is her father's favourite.

2805,2805,4470,Need a software backup solution with specific features,"I'm going to be formatting my machine in the next couple of days. I finally got Windows 7 set up how I like it and decided on a suite of software that I will be installing after each format. Since I tested a bunch of programs and the Windows installation is full of Junk, a clean install is needed. After I reinstall Win7 along with all the other software, I want to make a Drive Image so I can at any time go back to that exact setup. In the past I used Clonezilla. I would have it backup the entire drive, compress it, and then transfer it to a network store. This process is a pain in the butt though. It also ends up taking up too much space since Clonezilla uses dd and dd does not care what filesystem you are using. It makes a copy of the drive sector by sector. It doesn't know where a file ends or free space begins. This is what I am looking for this time around... (I don't care if its Open Source or Commercial, although free alternatives are always nice).


Does not include Unused Space in the drive image
Backs up the MBR and any other absolutely necessary information so the system goes back to exactly the way it was when it was backed up. I don't want to be worried that I have to repair the MBR or deal with other booting issues.
Can write the image to multiple DVDs AND to a network share. This means that it has to be able to split the backup.
Does not need Windows to work. It has a bootable disc version of the program in case I can't get into Windows and need to restore the backup.
Preferably makes the initial backup DVD (Disc 1) also the boot disc. So I can insert disc 1 into the computer, restart, and it will allow me to begin restoring the image to the drive. It would only ask for Disc 2 after it restored everything from the disc it booted from.
Loads itself into RAM, does not need to have the disc in the drive to function.
Supports NTFS (This should be pretty obvious).
Allows me to view the image file in a file editor and make changes in case I want to add/remove anything. (I don't care if this is only possible on the single file Network Backup and I have to recreate the DVDs. The bootable version does not need this).
I am going to be using this software only to image the drive. It will not be my daily/weekly/monthly backup solution. Therefore I don't want the imaging to force me into some backup schedule. If I have to force it to not make automatic backups after the initial image, I don't want it.
Is reliable, you would use it, makes consistently good images.


I guess that's it. Hopefully someone here knows of a program that does all this. I have been looking at various backup solutions and have not found something that I have really been happy with.

What is the difference between unicast, anycast, broadcast and multicast traffic?
What situations are they generally used in and why (e.g., what applications use which method)?
How do you calculate how much broadcast traffic is too much for a given network segment or broadcast domain?
What are the security implications of allowing broadcast and multicast traffic?

",kce,https://serverfault.com/users/62491,"Here's some basic info:

Unicast: Unicast traffic is traffic that is meant for a single host. All other hosts will ignore unicast traffic not meant for themselves. In a switched environment, unicast traffic is generally not ""heard"" by any hosts other than the host that the traffic is intended for. In an environment that uses hubs (shudder) all hosts will ""hear"" unicast traffic meant for every other host, but they'll ignore all traffic not intended for themselves.

Broadcast: Broadcast traffic is traffic that is sent with the intent of being ""heard"" by all hosts on a particular network segment. Examples of broadcast traffic would be an ARP request, which is a broadcast at the physical layer (MAC address FF-FF-FF-FF-FF-FF) or a NetBIOS name query, which is a broadcast at the network layer (whatever happens to be the broadcast address for that particular network, such as 64.28.42.63 for the network 64.28.42.0/26).

Multicast: Multicast traffic is traffic that is sent with the intent of being ""heard"" by a particular group of hosts on a network segment. Some multicast traffic can be considered broadcast traffic, such as traffic to the multicast address 224.0.0.1, which is multicast traffic meant for all hosts on the same network segment. Another example of multicast traffic would be traffic sent to the multicast address 224.0.0.9 which is what RIP routers use to send routing information to other RIP routers on the same network segment.

But how can you use this formula when one of the branches is a superconductor, eg:

  U = R_{\mathrm{tot}}\cdot I_{\mathrm{tot}}.

Since it's a parallel circuit, this is also

Third, trying to format the disk, it really sees only the sectors until 320GB:
When I start fdisk I am warned:

I have other USB hard drives with 320GB and they really mount fine. 


Is this a limitation of RPi? Or a problem with this specific Hard Drive?   
How can I use this large disk with my RPi? 


update: solved the issue with help of the commentators here...

here is what I did ...


I thought I have some weired issue with Debian Wheezy &amp; gparted. So, I reformatted the hard drive to NTFS. Before that I ERASED the partition table. 
And created a new single NTFS partition. 
Bingo! RPi, identified the partition. However, it claimed my Drive is now 2TB big, and recommended I will use GPT:

whoops! That is WRONG!

So, I disconnected the hard drive again. re-connented it to my laptop. I erased the partition table again, and re-created the partition table using fdisk on RPi! not on my laptop! This time, I took a short cut, and created the disk partition with ext4 directly. 
    I plugged the hard-drive to RPi and BINGO!

conclusion (?)

My guess is that gparted in Debian Wheezy includes some nasty bug which is sometimes showing it's ugly face. I would report a bug if I had more solid evidence. But ... since I have only one 500GB hard drive, and I don't want to
risk the health of this hard drive reformatting it so many time, I will settle this with it. If you happen to bump into this post, and you have had similar problems with large SATA drives and partitioning on wheezy, I would be happy to know.

First, /dev/sda is NOT recognized correctly! This disk is 500GB. 

Second, mounting /dev/sda2 is not possible:

# although fdisk -l showed this device !


Third, trying to format the disk, it really sees only the sectors until 320GB:
When I start fdisk I am warned:

Changes will remain in memory only, until you decide to write them.
After that, of course, the previous content won't be recoverable.

Command (m for help): w
The partition table has been altered!

I have other USB hard drives with 320GB and they really mount fine. 


Is this a limitation of RPi? Or a problem with this specific Hard Drive?   
How can I use this large disk with my RPi? 


update: solved the issue with help of the commentators here...

here is what I did ...


I thought I have some weired issue with Debian Wheezy &amp; gparted. So, I reformatted the hard drive to NTFS. Before that I ERASED the partition table. 
And created a new single NTFS partition. 
Bingo! RPi, identified the partition. However, it claimed my Drive is now 2TB big, and recommended I will use GPT:

root@raspberrypi:/home/ozn# fdisk -l /dev/sda

whoops! That is WRONG!

So, I disconnected the hard drive again. re-connented it to my laptop. I erased the partition table again, and re-created the partition table using fdisk on RPi! not on my laptop! This time, I took a short cut, and created the disk partition with ext4 directly. 
    I plugged the hard-drive to RPi and BINGO!

conclusion (?)

My guess is that gparted in Debian Wheezy includes some nasty bug which is sometimes showing it's ugly face. I would report a bug if I had more solid evidence. But ... since I have only one 500GB hard drive, and I don't want to
risk the health of this hard drive reformatting it so many time, I will settle this with it. If you happen to bump into this post, and you have had similar problems with large SATA drives and partitioning on wheezy, I would be happy to know.

I have a site where I would like to add a new block to the front page of the website. This block would show the companies newest available training's. I created the sub-pages of the training's.
My thought process was that I create the sub-pages, then create a new type of content (with the cck) where I can add the new sub-page node names and their links.
I created the new content type with two fields. field_offeringlink and field_offeringtext. Where the the text would be the actuall promotional text and the link directing to the sub-page.
After this I wanted to create a Block that I would place on the front page, showing these two fields.
I couldn't figure out this part...
So how do I make the bloody block show my fields?

OR

If you have a better idea for this whole shannanigan then I am welcome to ideas.

My goal:

Create a dynamic block on the front page, that shows all the latest training's. Under dynamic I mean, that we can add-remove the links from the admin/content menu.

3241,3241,5166,Applying OO patterns and principles to plugin development,"I'm busy writing my first plugin, using PHP 5.3.5. I come from a C# environment, and I must say I'm more than happy with the level of support for good, solid OOP techniques in PHP. However, I'm a little uncertain how to structure a plugin using classes. I have a plugin class that takes care of hook registration in its constructor, and some worker classes like a mail queue and mailer, but I have one or two non-class scripts, mostly for forms, that I don't quite know how to neatly fit into classes. What resources are their I can consult for guidance on this aspect of my OO plugin?

The plugin is for mass mailing, i.e. mailing to all subscribers, on schedule etc. It registers a custom post type for mail templates, with add new and edit capabilities, and it adds its own menu to the bottom of the admin menu, currently with two submenu pages: 'settings' and 'send mail'. It also adds an 'opt out' option to the user profile page, but that's quite tidy and easy to include the main plugin class.
",ProfK,https://wordpress.stackexchange.com/users/7268,"
  I have one or two non-class scripts, mostly for forms, that I don't quite know how to neatly fit into classes.


Split your project into multiple classes.  Keep your worker classes as instantiable objects (typical OOP patterns) and put your non-class scripts into a class of their own as static scripts.

I often use static PHP classes to namespace my code this way.  Example:

class My_Object {
    public $variable = 1;

    public function __construct() {
        // Constructor
    }

    public function do_something() {
        // Misc. method for the object
        $this-&gt;variable++;
    }
}

static class Helper {
    public static function Run_Script() {
        // Function that does something and doesn't belong in a class
    }
}


The difference between these two classes is that you instantiate one (My_Object) and use it as an object.  The other is basically a namespace wrapper for a function that doesn't belong in an object but that also doesn't belong in the global namespace.

Let's say you started with just a regular Run_Script() method in your plugin ... then later down the road, another developer adds a Run_Script() method to another plugin.  You now have a name conflict.  Keeping your standalone functions inside a static class helps prevent this.

Just call Helper::Run_Script() to access it.


  What resources are there I can consult for guidance on this aspect of my OO plugin?


Basically, look at what others have done.  There are quite a few quality plugins out there that follow this kind of a pattern.  So take a look at how others have tackled the problem and learn from their example.

GitHub is a great place to look at code.  Most of my plugins are up there, so you can browse through code files to view the structure without needing to download them and install them.

799,799,1268,How do I set serial special characters?,"In my ongoing quest to interface with some legacy equipment, I've discovered that the vendor supplied software sets the special characters to:

What do these bytes mean?
How can I tell SerialPort to use a specific set of special characters?


The latter is all I really care about, but I suspect the former is going to be useful to know.

5953,5953,9432,What should my credit limit be?,"I have two credit cards (through the same bank).  The first I got at age 18, and the 2nd I applied for while in grad school for better rewards.  I use credit cards (primarily the more recent one) for routine monthly expenses and I pay them off in full every month and reap the rewards.  The limits were pretty low while I was in school, but every 6 months or so they would notify me that they were raising my credit limit by a modest amount.  This continued for a while, but it stopped not long after I left school (which roughly coincided with banks becoming more reluctant to offer credit).

My income has increased several hundred percent over what it was while I was in grad school, and I feel my credit limits do not reflect that.  My combined credit limit between the two cards is a little over 12% of my yearly gross income.  I feel this is probably low, and I might like to increase it both to increase my credit score and to easier allow for multiple large purchases (computer, furniture, etc.) in the same month without using an excessively high portion of my available credit.  What guidelines should I use to determine how much of an increase, if any, to request?
",Michael McGowan,https://money.stackexchange.com/users/3360,"They probably stopped raising your limit because of the credit crisis and new regulations.

I don't think raising a limit ""just because"" makes a lot of sense. Some say it effects your credit score in the long run, but chances are they'll pull your credit when you ask for a raise and that will just lower the score.

I found it more accidentally while playing with Apex Launcher. Long pressing on a free space on one of the home screens, like you want to add a widget, opens the expected menu.

5955,5955,9435,Jquery - Customizing the colorbox plugin,"I'm using the colorbox plugin for modal popups. It's working nicely, but there's a main thing about it that seems wrong.

I have a form that pops up, and on submitting (or clicking a link) in the form, this might open another ""colorbox"" modal. It works smoothly, but there's one thing that bothers me.

As it is, colorbox seems to wait until it receives the response (via ajax) and then shows a ""loading.gif"" and starts to change size.

To me it makes more sense to have the ""loading.gif"" show as soon as they are opening a new colorbox modal. (and not just the image, I just mean that whatever happens when you open a new colorbox) It doesn't have to resize (obviously) but it's just annoying because some of my colorbox modals use webservices that are slow, so you might submit a form and nothing happens for literally 1 or 2 seconds. It'd be nice if it just would look like it was loading the next one for that time.

The example they give is carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide, where the mass ratio of oxygen to carbon in carbon dioxide is 2.67:1 and the mass ratio of oxygen to carbon in carbon monoxide is 1.33:1.

I understand the above example, and I understand that when you compare them in the following way:

2.67g (proportion of oxygen to 1g carbon in carbon dioxide)/ 1.33g (proportion of oxygen to 1g carbon in carbon monoxide) = 2.00, a small whole number.

$\frac{Mass~oxygen~to~1g~carbon~in~carbon~dioxide}{Mass~oxygen~to~1g~carbon~in~carbon~monoxide}$ = $\frac{2.67g}{1.33g}$ = 2.00

My textbook doesn't describe what a small whole number is, or what it means... just that, in this example, 2.00 is a small whole number.

1333,1333,2101,VB.net Service Programming and using TCP Sockets,"I am having a problem and I was curious if anyone could help me solve it.  I took a tutorial for client-server socket programming for VB.NET.  I then tried to implement it using a service rather than a program.  I understand how it works as a program, but when I try to port it over to a service it doesn't work.  When I run the service it starts and stops instantly.  It never makes a connection.  Unfortunately, I am not that great of VB.net programmer but so far I am liking it a lot for rapid development of programs.

The idea of this service is to:


run when the computer starts
grab the name of the PC
Send the name of the PC to the server

a.   the server then takes the name and looks it up in a database

b.   returns the time that the client machine is suppose to back up
The client machine then does the math for the current time and the time it’s suppose to backup &amp; put everything in ms.
Then the machine backs up at that specified time by running a dos command to launch the program.


Now to answer a question that I have found common in the forums.  Why don't I use task scheduler.  Well I did use task schedule and had the server control times to machines that way.  However, some computers will go into a dormant state, I would say this dormant state affects 20% of the machines.  No this dormant state is not sleep mode and not hibernation.  The computers are on and they are react very quickly to mouse movement.  I created a service that writes the time to a file on the C:\ and this has always worked.  So now I have decided to have a service on the client machine and have it communicate with the server.

I have collected very little information about creating service and network socket programming.  Unfortunately, I haven’t found anything that ties the 2 together.  I found a vb.net client-server program that does what I want, but I want it as a service not a program.  I found a temporary solution with creating files using PSEXEC from the server, but this process is just so umm unsophisticated.

I did the next best thing and I went and reviewed the Microsoft library for sockets and tried to build my own service based on what makes sense.  Still nothing works.  If you know of any books, resources, have any advice, etc. any help you can give me will be greatly appreciated.  Thank you for your assistance.

Below you will find my code.  At this point all I care about doing is making the connections between clients and the server.  I can go back to figuring out the rest and tweek the code from there.

",Mike,https://stackoverflow.com/users/1397089,"To find out why it's starting and then stopping, you might try looking in the Application event log after trying to start the service. Could be running into an error on (or just after) startup that is causing the service to stop.

I ran into that problem when trying to write a similar service--in my case I was trying to auto-detect the IP address to use, and it turns out it was inadvertently selecting my IPv6 loopback address and failing to bind. An error in the event log hinted at this for me.

I took a tutorial for client-server socket programming for VB.NET.  I then tried to implement it using a service rather than a program.  I understand how it works as a program, but when I try to port it over to a service it doesn't work.  When I run the service it starts and stops instantly.  It never makes a connection.  Unfortunately, I am not that great of VB.net programmer but so far I am liking it a lot for rapid development of programs.

The idea of this service is to:


run when the computer starts
grab the name of the PC
Send the name of the PC to the server

a.   the server then takes the name and looks it up in a database

b.   returns the time that the client machine is suppose to back up
The client machine then does the math for the current time and the time it’s suppose to backup &amp; put everything in ms.
Then the machine backs up at that specified time by running a dos command to launch the program.


Now to answer a question that I have found common in the forums.  Why don't I use task scheduler.  Well I did use task schedule and had the server control times to machines that way.  However, some computers will go into a dormant state, I would say this dormant state affects 20% of the machines.  No this dormant state is not sleep mode and not hibernation.  The computers are on and they are react very quickly to mouse movement.  I created a service that writes the time to a file on the C:\ and this has always worked.  So now I have decided to have a service on the client machine and have it communicate with the server.

I have collected very little information about creating service and network socket programming.  Unfortunately, I haven’t found anything that ties the 2 together.  I found a vb.net client-server program that does what I want, but I want it as a service not a program.  I found a temporary solution with creating files using PSEXEC from the server, but this process is just so umm unsophisticated.

I did the next best thing and I went and reviewed the Microsoft library for sockets and tried to build my own service based on what makes sense.  Still nothing works.  If you know of any books, resources, have any advice, etc. any help you can give me will be greatly appreciated.  Thank you for your assistance.

Below you will find my code.  At this point all I care about doing is making the connections between clients and the server.  I can go back to figuring out the rest and tweek the code from there.

","To find out why it's starting and then stopping, you might try looking in the Application event log after trying to start the service. Could be running into an error on (or just after) startup that is causing the service to stop.

I ran into that problem when trying to write a similar service--in my case I was trying to auto-detect the IP address to use, and it turns out it was inadvertently selecting my IPv6 loopback address and failing to bind. An error in the event log hinted at this for me.

4537,4537,7190,"What is the difference between ""Mongolian Grill"" and ""Hibachi""?","For years I have been frequenting Chinese restaurants that feature ""Mongolian Grill"" (or Mongolian BBQ depending on the location).

When I inquired about the Mongolian grill I was informed that there is a difference.

",Cos Callis,https://cooking.stackexchange.com/users/6279,"Hibachi are technically a traditional Japanese device used for heating one's house.  They are a basic, heat-proof container that holds charcoal.



The cooking devices that many people refer to as ""hibachi"" are what the Japanese would call ""shichirin"":



I'm guessing that the term ""hibachi"" was popularized in North America because ""shichirin"" can be hard to pronounce for Anglophones.

Somewhere along the way, primarily in North America, the term ""hibachi"" also started to be used to refer to teppanyaki:



I'm not sure when or why this started; perhaps it has something to do with the fact that Banihana confusingly refers to their teppanyaki restaurants as ""hibachi-style"".

Among these, teppanyaki is most similar to Mongolian barbecue, in which meat is cooked on large, round, cast iron griddles:



(Images taken from Wikipedia.)

If you were to actually go to a Japanese restaurant and cook your own food over a shichirin, it would likely be referred to as ""yakiniku"", which is believed to have some origins in Korean barbecue.

Whereas teppanyaki has been a traditional Japanese cooking method for a long time, ""Mongolian barbecue"" was developed in the 1970s in Taipei, Taiwan.  During that time, Japanese Teppanyaki was very popular in Taiwan, so many people speculate that was actually the inspiration for Mongolian barbecue.

4300,4300,6854,Get latitude/longitude of friend's current_location using Graph FQL,"I'm trying to get the latitude/longitude of all of a user's friends using a single API call. I believe I need to write a multi-query FQL statement, but I can't get the syntax correct.

I believe the two queries need to be something like the following:

'""friends"":""SELECT uid,current_location FROM user WHERE uid IN (SELECT uid2 FROM friend WHERE uid1 = me())""'

'""location"":""SELECT location FROM page WHERE id IN (SELECT current_location_id FROM #friends)""';


My problem is that somehow I need to get the ID of the current_location in the first query so that I can reference it in the second query, but I only know how to get an array that contains the id.

Thanks for any help!

Clarification:

I'm not trying to get check-ins of friends.  Instead I want to graph the ""current_location"" (i.e. where they live) of all of a user's friends on a Geo map.  I can get a user's ""current_location"" with the following FQL query:

""SELECT uid,sex,current_location FROM user WHERE uid IN (SELECT uid2 FROM friend WHERE uid1 = me())""


This query returns the following array:

[current_location] =&gt; Array
            (
                [city] =&gt; New York
                [state] =&gt; New York
                [country] =&gt; United States
                [zip] =&gt; 
                [id] =&gt; 108424279189115
                [name] =&gt; New York, New York
            )


Which does not contain the longitude and latitude of the of the current_location (New York in the above example)

Therefore I now need to take the ID of the current_location (e.g. 108424279189115) and run a second FQL query such as:

""SELECT location,name FROM page WHERE page_id = 108424279189115)""


To get the latitude and longitude of the current_location.  Currently, I have a working code that runs the first FQL query, then extracts page_id in php, and then runs a second FQL query to get the current_location latitude/longitude.  However, for performance reasons I would like to run only one multi-query if this is possible.

One of its main advantages is its capablility of working, without many modifications, similarly on a Windows or *nix platforms.

It also has good support for connecting to Microsoft SQL Servers, in particular 2005 + 2008 through the mssql module + ntwdblib.dll or FreeTDS.

That being said, the more time I spend developing PHP, the more I feel the need to pick up another scripting language to broaden my skill set and to develop better web-based applications.

Because of this I've spent some time exploring alternative scripting languages in an effort to evaluate their suitability.

At present the biggest hurdle I have come accross is support provided by recent versions of the Open Source scripting languages, specifically: Python 3.2.2, Ruby 1.9.2, Node 0.5.7 for the Windows OS (WinXP in my case) and Microsoft SQL Server (2005 + 2008).

My existing working environ necessitates the requirement for connecting to a MSSQL database.

I'm looking for answers from developers who have experience working with either Python, Ruby or Node.js and using them to interacting with a MS SQL Server.

What would be your recommended Open Source scripting language which has good support for MS SQL Server.

Ideas welcome.

5624,5624,8919,Demonstrating the insecurity of an RSA signature encoding scheme,"I'm working on problem 12.4 from Katz-Lindell. The problem is as follows:


  Given a public encoding function $\newcommand{\enc}{\operatorname{enc}}\enc$ and
  a textbook RSA signature scheme where signing occurs by finding $\enc(m)$ and
  raising it to the private key $d \bmod N$, how can we demonstrate the scheme's
  insecurity for $\enc(m) = 0||m||0^{L/10}$, where $L = |N|$ and $|m| = 9L/10 - 1$
  and m is not the message of all zeroes?

$$s^e \cdot enc(m_0) \cdot \prod_{0\lt i\lt k} enc(m_i)^{u_i} \equiv r^e \pmod n$$
because this implies (by raising to the power $d$)
$$ Sign(m_0) \equiv r \cdot s^{-1} \cdot\prod_{0\lt i\lt k}Sign(m_i)^{-u_i} \pmod n$$
which allows computing the signature of $m_0$ (if $k\gt 1$, it is also necessary that the attacker obtain the signatures of the other messages $m_i$; that becomes an existential forgery, or chosen-message attack). Although dated, Jean-Francois Misarsky's How (Not) to Design RSA Signature Schemes is an interesting and relatively easy reading on that topic.

In fact, every known attack on an RSA signature scheme is either of the above kind (with more or less involved computations to exhibit $m_i$, $u_i$, $r$, $s$); or amounts to factorization of $n$ (which includes anything recovering $d$, perhaps by side-channel attack); or is some implementation error, perhaps widespread.

In order to mount an attack of the above kind, a relation of the form $enc(m_0)=r^e$ is ideal. It gives the signature of $m_0$ without any consideration on $n$ or known signature. When $e$ is 3, 5 or 7, this can be done with the encoding $enc$ in the question, by considering $r=2^t$ for some appropriate $t$, and extended to $r=v\cdot2^t$ for some small $v$.

Similarly, $enc(m_0) = r^e\cdot enc(m_1)$ gives the signature of one message from the signature of the other, without any consideration on $n$. This can be done with the encoding $enc$ in the question, for a wider choice of $e$.

Similarly, $enc(m_0) \cdot enc(m_1) = enc(m_2) \cdot enc(m_3)$ gives the signature of one message from the signature of the other three, for any public key $(n,e)$. With the encoding $enc$ in the question, there is ample choice (the equation simplifies to $m_0\cdot m_1=m_2\cdot m_3$, and all messages which left bit is 0 or which integer representation is composite are vulnerable). The ISO/IEC 9796:1991 signature encoding scheme (section 11.3.5 of the Handbook of Applied Cryptography), now withdrawn, turned out to be vulnerable to that, of course if the adversary can obtain the signature of three chosen messages, and is content with the signature of the fourth.

Even the hash-based ISO/IEC 9796-2:1997 (now known as ISO/IEC 9796-2:2010 scheme 1), still in wide use, is vulnerable if the adversary can obtain the signature of many weird chosen messages and is content with the signature of another, which fortunately is seldom the case in practice.

I would like to be able to add a class to the ul (i.e. &lt;ul class=""list-group""&gt;)
I would like to style my Category sidebar widget to support this new component, but as you see, this requires classes on each li item.


In reading some similar posts, one option I found is to use jQuery to add the class to each li, but I am concerned about the dreaded FOUC. 

Is there some WordPress function that gets me to my goal?

Please advise,

Update: 

I was able to add classes to the individual li's by creating a Custom Walker which extends Walker_Category (see code below), but this still does not get me to the ul which also needs a class added (eg &lt;ul class=""list-group""&gt;). 

class Walker_Category_BS extends Walker_Category {
    function start_el( &amp;$output, $category, $depth = 0, $args = array() ) {
        extract($args);

Update 02: 

After viewing default-widgets.php in the core, I decided to create a new widget (WP_Widget_Categories_BS, see code below) wherein I basically, copied all the code from the default category widget and simply modified the the UL to add the necessary class. 

&lt;?php

        parent::__construct('categories', __('Boostrap Categories'), $widget_ops);
    }

    function widget( $args, $instance ) {
        extract( $args );

        $title = apply_filters('widget_title', empty( $instance['title'] ) ? __( 'Categories' ) : $instance['title'], $instance, $this-&gt;id_base);
        $c = ! empty( $instance['count'] ) ? '1' : '0';
        $h = ! empty( $instance['hierarchical'] ) ? '1' : '0';
        $d = ! empty( $instance['dropdown'] ) ? '1' : '0';

        echo $before_widget;
        if ( $title )
            echo $before_title . $title . $after_title;

        $cat_args = array('orderby' =&gt; 'name', 'show_count' =&gt; $c, 'hierarchical' =&gt; $h);
        if ( $d ) {
            $cat_args['show_option_none'] = __('Select Category');
            wp_dropdown_categories(apply_filters('widget_categories_dropdown_args', $cat_args));
?&gt;

&lt;script type='text/javascript'&gt;
/* &lt;![CDATA[ */
    var dropdown = document.getElementById(""cat"");
    function onCatChange() {
        if ( dropdown.options[dropdown.selectedIndex].value &gt; 0 ) {
            location.href = ""&lt;?php echo home_url(); ?&gt;/?cat=""+dropdown.options[dropdown.selectedIndex].value;
        }
    }

Is there any reason for me to prefer the second version to the first?

4045,4045,6457,Behavior when validating an expired certificate chain,"I have the following situation: 


A server certificate (CServ) is signed by self-signed certificate (C0)
A client certificate (CCli) is signed by CServ
Client's trust-store contains C0, so the client application can trust CServ


Note: C0 is actually a simulation of a CA certificate for testing purposes.

Now, let's consider a situation when C0 either is expired or not yet valid. Since it's stored in client's trust-store, is it still trusted? In other words is chain [C0, CServ] still valid?
",Andrey Atapin,https://security.stackexchange.com/users/9288,"The trust store seems to contain certificates, but that's an illusion (or a tradition). Technically, a trust anchor, i.e. the basis for the trust in certificate validation, is a name coupled with a public key. It so happens that people found it convenient to store the name and public key as a file with the same format as a certificate; this required some trickeries, such as the ""self-signature"", which makes no sense but had to be included because the format for a certificate includes a non-optional field for a signature.

At that point, it really depends on the OS/browser internal conventions. Some implementations will look at the ""validity dates"" in the trust anchor ""certificate"" and will use them as, indeed, validity dates (i.e. beyond the end of validity date, they will cease to trust that trust anchor, even if it is still ""there"", in the dedicated store for trust anchors). Some other implementations will ignore these dates altogether. It is really up to each implementation to make these choices, since the standard is silent on the subject.

5943,5943,9417,Grinding sound during cold start?,"I have a 2009 Honda Accord.  Over the past several months, I've noticed a grinding sound immediately after cold-starting the engine.  It only lasts for a fraction of a second, doesn't continue once the engine is running, and doesn't happen if I shut the engine off and start it again a few minutes later.

A little background:

The car has 92,000 miles on it.  I've noticed that it burns oil pretty quickly, so I keep an eye on it and make sure to add more if needed.  Most recently, I got an oil change with a high mileage synthetic, but that has not solved the issue.

Does anyone know what this could be?  Is it a big deal?  I'm obviously worried about damaging the engine.  Is this a major thing?  Or is it something I can live with, provided I don't mind the frightening noise that occurs on startup.

134,134,214,k-center algorithm in one-dimensional space,"I'm aware of the general k-center approximation algorithm, but my professor (this is a question from a CS class) says that in a one-dimensional space, the problem can be solved (optimal solution found, not an approximation) in O(n^2) polynomial time without depending on k or using dynamic programming.

A general description of the k-center problem: Given a set of nodes in an n-dimensional space, cluster them into k clusters such that the ""radius"" of each cluster (distance from furthest node to its center node) is minimized. A more formal and detailed description can be found at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_k-center

As you might expect, I can't figure out how this is possible. The part currently causing me problems is how the runtime can not rely on k.

The nature of the problem causes me to try to step through the nodes on a sort of number line and try to find points to put boundaries, marking off the edges of each cluster that way. But this would require a runtime based on k.

The O(n^2) runtime though makes me think it might involve filling out an nxn array with the distance between two nodes in each entry.

Any explanation on how this is works or tips on how to figure it out would be very helpful.
",philv,https://cs.stackexchange.com/users/22958,"First,


  There exist optimal solutions in which each cluster consists of a contiguous sequence of points in the real line.


Any other optimal solutions can be transformed into the cases above. In the following, we focus on the optimal solutions of the kind above.



The complexity of the following ""dynamic programming"" algorithm is $O(n^2 k) = O(n^3)$.

The case for $k=1$ is easy. Denote the optimal solution to $k=1$ in $n$ points by $R_{n,1}$.

Let $R(n,k)$ be the optimal solution for the problem of $k$-center in the first $n$ points. For convenience, define $R(n,k) = 0$ if $k \ge n$ (This is reasonable because we can choose each point as the center of the cluster consisting of only itself).

For general $k &gt; 1$, we consider all the cases according to the number (denoted $m$) of points that are assigned to the last cluster (that is, the last cluster contains a contiguous sequence of the rightmost $m$ points).

$$R(n,k) = \min_{0 \le m \le n} \{ R(n-m, k-1) + R_{m,1} \}$$

The complexity of the ""dynamic programming"" algorithm is $O(n^2 k) = O(n^3)$.

5396,5396,8573,"New to circuits, confused about where reset happens with SR flip-flop","In one of my classes we are learning about circuits. For homework, we have to create a finite state machine for a vending machine using an SR flip-flop. The machine can either take a nickel, dime, or nothing until it gets to at least 15 cents, so it has 4 states (0, 5, 10, and 15 cents). Once the machine receives 15 cents, it dispenses its product. Once in this state, if nothing is deposited it goes to the 0 state; if a nickel is deposited it goes to the 5 cent state; if a dime is deposited, it does to the 10 cent state. 

The truth table that I came up with is:

Present|Inputs| Next  |        | SR Flip Flop

Based on this truth table [and the k-maps I made from it], I created the following logic gates:


My question is, where exactly does the ""reset"" happen? For example, if I am in the 15 cent state and deposit a nickel, how does it go to the 5 cent stage? Do I have to make the output from ""open"" loop around? Sorry for such a novice question, I hope that made sense!

Edit: The first two columns are for the present state of the machine, i.e., how much you have deposited so far. So Q0 Q1 = 00 represents the first state (0 cents), Q0 Q1 = 01 represents the second state (5 cents), etc. The next two columns represent adding a nickel or dime. If you are in the state 00 and and 01, you should move to state 01. Since you cannot deposit a nickel and dime simultaneously, we don't care about the the input 11. If you are in state 10 and add 10, you go to state 11 (and don't get any change back!).
",A D,https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/8855,"Depending upon how the coin sensors and output of the machine are implemented, you might need some more states to allow for the fact that a coin might be hitting a switch for an arbitrary length of time; I don't see anything in your machine to handle that.  It's also not clear how long the ""dispense product"" output is supposed to be active.  A logical possibility would be that ""dispense product"" should remain active until a signal is returned from the mechanism indicating that the product has been dispensed, whereupon the machine should reset to its start state.

Also, if you are going to use RS latches, you need to design your machine so that if multiple latches switch simultaneously for a state transition, it won't matter whether one switches before the other.  If the machine was sitting in state ""01"" and a nickel arrived, it would attempt to transition into state ""10"".

",user275846,https://askubuntu.com/users/275846,"Okay I got build errors. Haven't got time to test it at the moment :(.

Also: ""After this operation, 1779 MB of additional disk space will be used.""
So make sure you have a few GB's set aside if you're going to do this.



Okay so I got it working by following this: How to install the Pantheon desktop environment? Basically the PPA everyone is suggesting works, is 404-ing for me (and presumably you) when I try and access it.

1) This is syslinux-themes-elementary-isis, and the .sh script apparently requires it. Sudo apt-get didn't find it for me. You could probably test removing this dependency from the .sh if you are feeling bold. I installed amd64 version of this (as I am on 64 bit, if you are on 32 bit obviously don't), just use a .deb installer on Ubuntu:

https://launchpad.net/~elementary-os/+archive/daily/+files/syslinux-themes-elementary-isis_2-0%7E4%7Esaucy1_amd64.deb


2) This is required by the elementary os install script:

sudo apt-get install dctrl-tools dpkg-dev 
    genisoimage gfxboot-theme-ubuntu live-build squashfs-tools syslinux zsync


3) The script uses this to determine what files to download (obviously don't do both, amd64 is for 64bit and i386 is for 32 bit) (you'll want to put this in .bashrc or somewhere else for it to be permanent, not 100% anyone will ever need this again though):

export ARCH=amd64
export ARCH=i386


4) From the previous question/answer thread:

sudo apt-get install bzr
bzr branch lp:elementaryos
cd elementaryos
sudo congrego.sh


On my machine I didn't specify $ARCH so I got 90% of the way through a 970 M .iso file for i386 before I realised -_-.

Currently running through the amd64 installation.



As an aside:

# load config
source etc/congrego.conf

if [[ ""$ARCH"" == ""all"" ]]; then
        $(dirname ""$0"")/bin/download.sh i386
        $(dirname ""$0"")/bin/download.sh amd64
        $(dirname ""$0"")/bin/build.sh i386
        $(dirname ""$0"")/bin/build.sh amd64
        if [[ ""$SOURCEFORGE"" != """" ]]; then
            $(dirname ""$0"")/bin/sourceforge.sh i386
            $(dirname ""$0"")/bin/sourceforge.sh amd64
        fi
else
        $(dirname ""$0"")/bin/download.sh ""$ARCH""
        $(dirname ""$0"")/bin/build.sh ""$ARCH""
        $(dirname ""$0"")/bin/sourceforge.sh ""$ARCH""
fi


It is a bit presumptuous that users would have that environment variable set. Unless I am reading it wrong, it seems like it will download iso's for i386 AND amd64 and then build both of them, which sounds like a bad idea. I'm noob at bash script though so it could be fine for all I know.

Just in case this is irrelevant to your machine:

","Okay I got build errors. Haven't got time to test it at the moment :(.

Also: ""After this operation, 1779 MB of additional disk space will be used.""
So make sure you have a few GB's set aside if you're going to do this.



Okay so I got it working by following this: How to install the Pantheon desktop environment? Basically the PPA everyone is suggesting works, is 404-ing for me (and presumably you) when I try and access it.

1) This is syslinux-themes-elementary-isis, and the .sh script apparently requires it. Sudo apt-get didn't find it for me. You could probably test removing this dependency from the .sh if you are feeling bold. I installed amd64 version of this (as I am on 64 bit, if you are on 32 bit obviously don't), just use a .deb installer on Ubuntu:

https://launchpad.net/~elementary-os/+archive/daily/+files/syslinux-themes-elementary-isis_2-0%7E4%7Esaucy1_amd64.deb


2) This is required by the elementary os install script:

sudo apt-get install dctrl-tools dpkg-dev 
    genisoimage gfxboot-theme-ubuntu live-build squashfs-tools syslinux zsync


3) The script uses this to determine what files to download (obviously don't do both, amd64 is for 64bit and i386 is for 32 bit) (you'll want to put this in .bashrc or somewhere else for it to be permanent, not 100% anyone will ever need this again though):

export ARCH=amd64
export ARCH=i386


4) From the previous question/answer thread:

sudo apt-get install bzr
bzr branch lp:elementaryos
cd elementaryos
sudo congrego.sh


On my machine I didn't specify $ARCH so I got 90% of the way through a 970 M .iso file for i386 before I realised -_-.

Currently running through the amd64 installation.



As an aside:

# load config
source etc/congrego.conf

if [[ ""$ARCH"" == ""all"" ]]; then
        $(dirname ""$0"")/bin/download.sh i386
        $(dirname ""$0"")/bin/download.sh amd64
        $(dirname ""$0"")/bin/build.sh i386
        $(dirname ""$0"")/bin/build.sh amd64
        if [[ ""$SOURCEFORGE"" != """" ]]; then
            $(dirname ""$0"")/bin/sourceforge.sh i386
            $(dirname ""$0"")/bin/sourceforge.sh amd64
        fi
else
        $(dirname ""$0"")/bin/download.sh ""$ARCH""
        $(dirname ""$0"")/bin/build.sh ""$ARCH""
        $(dirname ""$0"")/bin/sourceforge.sh ""$ARCH""
fi


It is a bit presumptuous that users would have that environment variable set. Unless I am reading it wrong, it seems like it will download iso's for i386 AND amd64 and then build both of them, which sounds like a bad idea. I'm noob at bash script though so it could be fine for all I know.

Just in case this is irrelevant to your machine:

When I try to log into Linux servers from my Windows desktop at work, I've noticed that if I mis-type my password, it takes a good 5 seconds or so before I get ""Access Denied"" back. Then when I type my password correctly, the login (along with welcome messages etc) is virtually instant.

Is there any logical reason for this, or would it be down to some odd configuration that's specific to the machines here at work?

4838,4838,7696,Do inner shell electrons feel the electric field/force from an outer shell electron in an atom?,"We just finished studying Gauss’ law and were puzzled by this thought. If I look at a copper atom and focus on the 29th electron in the 4th shell, according to Gauss’ law, I can draw a Gaussian surface that completely encloses the first three shells plus the nucleus. It is my understanding that the 29th electron will not contribute to the E-field inside this Gaussian because this charge is outside the Gaussian.  However, it does not mean that the 29th electron doesn’t apply an electric force on the inner electrons, especially the 3rd shell electrons. So here is my dilemma: wouldn’t this effect the E-field of the inner shell electrons?

Please, if possible, answer this question without quantum if possible.
",Lisa Lee,https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/29653,"It is a misconception to think that just because the 29th electron is outside the gaussian surface, it will not have an effect on the electric field inside it. The total flux through the surface is indeed zero, but that doesn't mean there is no influence: imagine a point charge and draw up a sphere next to it. The electric field goes in on one face and out the other to make a zero flux, but there's definitely a field inside.

The situation for copper is slightly more complicated because the  electron is in a spherically symmetric s orbital. This does reduce its influence on the inner electrons, not because of Gauss's law but because of a theorem of Newton:


  the electric field due to a spherical shell of charge vanishes inside it.


However, the 4s orbital is not simply a spherical shell of charge around the [Ar] 3d10 core. Even in the most simplistic, hydrogen-based models, the higher s orbitals still have a sizable probability of being inside the core, and have multiple shells of positive probability:



 Source: Wikipedia. Note that this is a 6s hydrogen orbital with no actual relation to copper; a 4s orbital has four such spherical shells.

Because of this, the 4s electron does create a nonzero electric field inside the atomic core, and this does affect the inner electrons.



As you have guessed, of course, in real life this is much, much more complicated, and quantum chemists will send you packing if you tell them you need an accurate ab initio description of the whole copper atom all the way to the 1s2 core. The electrons are highly correlated, and all of them interact strongly with each other, including such lovely job-simplifying features like exchange interactions. Quantum mechanically, the bottom line to your question is that it's meaningless to talk about ""the 29th electron,"" because all the electrons are indistinguishable and therefore you must consider them all as a whole. (Specifically, ""the charge density due to the electron in the 4s orbital"" is not a meaningful physical quantity.)

However, the quantumness actually helps. The reason for this is clear if you try to come up with a classical model of a copper atom. Even if you preserved the shell structure with the lone 4s electron orbiting well outside them, the inner electrons will be a hugely complicated jumble of electrons whizzing around, and the system will be nowhere near spherically symmetric. While you can still draw a gaussian sphere and get information about the total flux, this does not help at all in describing the electric field at any particular point.

In the quantum case, on the other hand, everything is much simpler. You have a bunch of closed shells and a single $s$ electron, and this means that the whole atom is spherically symmetric. Electric fields must be radial and uniform, and drawing gaussian spheres does help you calculate the electric field at a given radius.

1150,1150,1805,Stern-Gerlach and Hund's second rule,"According to Hund's second rule, the spin tends to be maximal. 
That would, in my understanding, imply that, regarding the Stern-Gerlach experiment, the important electron in a silver atom has spin 1/2 (or ""up""). This should hold for all atoms.

Every atom would have the same spin magnetic moment (smm) - because the smm points in direction of the spin - and thus be affected by the B-field just like any other atom.

But, if every electron has the same smm w.r.t. the magnetic field, why do we get two ""blobs"" on the screen and not just one ""blob"" above or below the z-axis?

Where is the error in my thought process?
",Jo Be,https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/30389,"Although an electron is referred to as a spin 1/2 particle, it doesn't mean it is in a spin 1/2 state (confused yet?).  A spin 1/2 particle has two states it can be in. It can be +1/2 in which case it goes up Stern-Gerlach experiment, or it can be in the -1/2 state in which case it goes down.

If there are two unpaired electrons in a molecule, then it is called a spin 1 molecule and has three states (+1, 0 and -1).

5892,5892,9333,Questions about geometric distribution,"I have some trouble understanding the record value for a sequence of i.i.d. random variables of geometric distribution. Following quotation is from Univariate discrete distributions By Norman Lloyd Johnson, Adrienne W. Kemp, Samuel Kotz.


  The lack-of-memory property of the
  geometric distribution gives it a role
  comparable to that of the exponential
  distribution. There are a number of
  characterizations of the geometric
  distribution based on record values.



For the  record time $T_n$, 


  If $X_j$ is observed at time $j$ ,
  then the record time sequence $\{T_n ,n \geq 0\}$ is defined as
  $T_0 = 1$
  with probability $1$ and $T_n = \min\{j : X_j &gt; X_{t_{n−1}} \}$ for
  $n\geq 1$. 


Is there a typo in $T_n = \min \{j : X_j &gt;
    X_{t_{n−1}} \}$? Should it be instead $T_n
    = \min\{j : X_j &gt; X_{T_{n−1}} \}$?
For the  record value $R_n$, 


  The record value sequence
  $\{R_n \}$ is defined as $R_n =X_{T_n} , n = 0, 1, 2, ...$. Suppose
  that the $X_j$ ’s are iid geometric
  variables with pmf $$p_x = p(1 − p)^{x−1}, x = 1, 2, ...$$ Then $R_n
    =X_{T_n} = \sum_{j=0}^{n} X_j$ is
  distributed as the sum of $n + 1$ iid
  geometric variables.


why does the second equality in
""$R_n =X_{T_n} = \sum_{j=0}^{n} X_j$
"" hold?
For the process of the record values
$\{ R_n, n \in \mathbb{N}\}$, 


  Each of the following properties
  characterizes the geometric
  distribution: 
  
  (i) Independence: The rv’s $R_0 , R_1  - R_0 , ... , R_{n+1} - R_n ,...$ are independent. 
  
  (ii) Same Distribution: $R_{n+1} - R_n$ has the same distribution as
  $R_0$ . 
  
  (iii) Constant Regression: $E[R_{n+1}- R_n |R_n ]$ is constant.


How to show that the three
properties hold? Are they derived
from the memoryless property of
geometric distribution?

What else can we say about the
process based on the memoryless
property of geometric distribution?


Thanks for your advice!
",Ethan,https://math.stackexchange.com/users/3616,"Your second point looks wrong in the book.  I think
$$R_n = X_{T_n} = X_{T_0} + \sum_{i=1}^n \left(X_{T_i} - X_{T_{i-1}}\right)$$ 
or 
$$R_n = X_{T_n} = R_0 + \sum_{i=1}^n (R_i - R_{i-1})$$
might be better (and obvious).  

Since $T_0 = 1$, $R_0 = X_{T_0} = X_1$, identically distributed as each of the $X_j$. 

This is where the memorylessness of the geometric distribution applies, because it has the property that $R_n - R_{n-1} = X_{T_n} - X_{T_{n-1}}$ has the same distribution as $X_j$ because if $X_{T_{n-1}} = k$ then
$$Pr(X_{T_n} - X_{T_{n-1}} = m) = Pr(X_{T_n} = m+k | X_{T_n} &gt; k) = \frac{p(1 − p)^{m+k−1}}{\sum_{j \ge 1} p(1 − p)^{j+k−1} } = p(1 − p)^{m−1}$$
and is independent of k and of all the $X_j$ for $j &lt; T_{n-1}$ and $j&gt;T_n$

So $R_j - R_{j-1}$ has the same distribution as $X_j$ and combined with independence leads to $R_n$ having the same distribution as $\sum_{j=0}^n X_j$, i.e. 


  as the sum of $n + 1$ iid geometric variables.


as the book says.

I think the book is wrong with its equals sign: two (sums of) random variables can have the same distribution without being the same.  If $A$ is uniformly distributed on $[0,1]$ and $B = 1-A$, then $A$ and $B$ have the same distribution, but they are unlikely to be equal to each other.

$$R_n = X_{T_n} = R_0 + \sum_{i=1}^n (R_i - R_{i-1})$$
might be better (and obvious).  

Since $T_0 = 1$, $R_0 = X_{T_0} = X_1$, identically distributed as each of the $X_j$. 

This is where the memorylessness of the geometric distribution applies, because it has the property that $R_n - R_{n-1} = X_{T_n} - X_{T_{n-1}}$ has the same distribution as $X_j$ because if $X_{T_{n-1}} = k$ then
$$Pr(X_{T_n} - X_{T_{n-1}} = m) = Pr(X_{T_n} = m+k | X_{T_n} &gt; k) = \frac{p(1 − p)^{m+k−1}}{\sum_{j \ge 1} p(1 − p)^{j+k−1} } = p(1 − p)^{m−1}$$
and is independent of k and of all the $X_j$ for $j &lt; T_{n-1}$ and $j&gt;T_n$

So $R_j - R_{j-1}$ has the same distribution as $X_j$ and combined with independence leads to $R_n$ having the same distribution as $\sum_{j=0}^n X_j$, i.e. 


  as the sum of $n + 1$ iid geometric variables.


as the book says.

I think the book is wrong with its equals sign: two (sums of) random variables can have the same distribution without being the same.  If $A$ is uniformly distributed on $[0,1]$ and $B = 1-A$, then $A$ and $B$ have the same distribution, but they are unlikely to be equal to each other.

Is it bad practice to change a simple statement like this to the following?:

Because they work exactly the same, and work as required, so I can't imagine how it would be. However, as a young, inexperienced programmer I am not aware of whether such a thing is frowned upon or not. Can anyone tell me, if this is NOT ok, why not?

The following test program:

using System;

        bool test1;

5672,5672,8993,Why does my bike make a noise when I pedal hard?,"When I pedal forcing a little with my right leg, the bike makes a noise that I don't know how to describe. I'll try to do it. It's like:


a short ""ting""
a tiny bell
if a small rock hits the down tube


I don't know what is causing this noise, but I think that it could be any of this things:


pedal
crank arm/pedal connection
crankset


I think the material of all these things is alluminium.

I don't feel anything (like a bad shifted chain) when I hear the noise.

It happens when there is movement and when there is NO movement (I use the brake, so the bike doesn'e move, stand using all weight on right pedal, and it makes the noise)

The pedals could be in any position, It is not in a particular position. Just pressing the right pedal.

Has someone else has this ""problem""? Any ideas of where this comes from?

Update:
Yesterday I took out the chain and stood on the right pedal, and made the noise. Then is not the chain, nor the transmission system.

I put oil in the pedal axis, but had no luck. Also tried to loose the pedal, but the juncture point is too tight, and I couldn't.

Today I will try to use oil in the bottom bracket.

Update: here is a link to info on the bike http://www.diamondback.com/2012-sorrento maybe it helps to know the model of all the components.

44,44,65,Silverlight: Returning value from synchronous method using Rx,"I am writing a simple Silverlight application and WCF Service.
I want to create a synchronous method that return a value.
The method itself, call an asynchronous method from WCF Services. After I call asynchronous method, I want to get it value, and return to sender.
I hear that Rx can solve this kind of problem.

This is my code :

    private void btnCreate_Click(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
    {
        string myResult = getMyBook(txtBookName.Text);
        MessageBox.Show(""Result\n"" + myResult);
        // myResult will be use for another purpose here..
    }

    // I want this method can be called anywhere, as long as the caller still in the same namespace.
    public string getMyBook(string bookName)
    {
        Servo.ServoClient svc = new ServoClient();
        string returnValue = """";

        var o = Observable.FromEventPattern&lt;GetBookCompletedEventArgs&gt;(svc, ""GetBookCompleted"");
        o.Subscribe(
            b =&gt; returnValue = b.EventArgs.Result
            );

        svc.GetBookAsync(bookName);
        return returnValue;
    }


When I click btnCreate, myResult variable still empty. Is that something wrong with my code? Or maybe I am just don't understand with Rx concept? I am new to Rx.

My goal is : I need to get the result (myResult variable) from asynchronous method, and then used in later code.
",Trom,https://stackoverflow.com/users/1219992,"Remember that GetBookAsync returns immediately, and will return the value stored in returnvalue. When the data arrives returnvalue will be out of scope, and by then btnCreate will have finished.

U could use await on the GetBookAsync, so that it will wait for the data to arrive before continuing.  Don't forget that would mean u also need the async on the method.

1131,1131,1773,hard self collision: make particles occupy space,"By default, Blender's particles don't have any spatial extension. This is fine as long as particles are rendered as halos. But if you give them a size and an appearance as object, it becomes obvious that they're able to go through each other.

What tricks can be pulled off to fix that problem?
For example, if you want to fill an area with houses, toss some leaves onto the floor, or just want charged balls to stick to each other.

I'm aware that a precise solution of this problem is very challenging -- but already some kind of approximation would do in most cases.
",Ichthyo,https://blender.stackexchange.com/users/2615,"one partial and approximate solution is to use the harmonic forces as a self-effect on the particle system. Here, ""harmonic forces"" means to turn the particles into a set of oscillators, connected by virtual springs. The rest distance is the distance we want to keep between objects.

The key point to note is that this now adds an attraction for particles spaced wider than the rest distance, and that it might lead to wobbling. The latter can be controlled with a high damping factor (at or close to 1 gives us ""acyclic damping""). To control the former, judicious use of the maximum distance and the strength and power of the force field is necessary. The result can be further improved by use of charged particles (so they repulse each other) and maybe combine that with invisible, charged objects as external attractors.

As long as the particles are rendered as halos, this is fine. But if you give them a size and appearance as objects, it's clear that they can cross each other.","one partial and approximate solution is to use the harmonic forces as a self-effect on the particle system. Here, ""harmonic forces"" means to turn the particles into a set of oscillators, connected by virtual springs. The rest distance is the distance we want to keep between objects.

The key point to note is that this now adds an attraction for particles spaced wider than the rest distance, and that it might lead to wobbling. The latter can be controlled with a high damping factor (at or close to 1 gives us ""acyclic damping""). To control the former, judicious use of the maximum distance and the strength and power of the force field is necessary. The result can be further improved by use of charged particles (so they repulse each other) and maybe combine that with invisible, charged objects as external attractors.

Downside of this approach is that the self effect on particles is limited to two forces and that getting the right behaviour can be tricky and insidious.

67,67,105,Modern design - What's that?,"I am working on redesigning my website and iterating through fivesecondtests. 

The overall feedback is improving but no matter what I change, several people have mentionned that my designs look ""dated"". ""Not modern"". ""Use modern fonts"". 


  What are ""modern fonts""? 
  Technically, Calibri, Cambria, etc. are ""modern fonts"", but I hardly ever see those online. What fonts are considered ""modern"" in the context of web design?
  
  What are the characteristics of a ""modern design""? Conversely what
  are the tell tale signs of a ""dated"" design?


For reference, here is the latest iteration of my design. Does it still look ""dated""? If so, what elements give that impression?





I think I am starting to get a better idea of what ""modern web design"" is:


No or light gradients
Sans serif typefaces
Light drop shadows
Good page hierarchy / directing visitor's attention


Is there anything else that makes a design look ""modern""? 

I have implemented the most of the recommendations in the answers, and I feel it has improved the design a lot. (Never mind the logo - will figure that one out later) 



Am I still stuck in the past? Or am I finally getting somewhere?



Implementing all recommendations, this is what I get:


It's obviously much better, but is it up to modern standards yet? If not, can it get there without changing massively the layout? 



The learning process never ends, does it? Assume that the central menu has a lava effect and that hopefully I can get a decent photo of myself shot to replace that one.



Looking at the various versions, I can see the design improving by leaps and bounds. Not sure how much further it needs to improve to reach professional standards, but it's certainly moving in the right direction.

Thanks a lot to all of you. I am impressed by the quality of the advice and how specific and actionable most recommendations have been so far.
",Sylverdrag,https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/users/3392,"From my understanding of what you are asking it is very subjective to quantify a design as "" modern"". However many website design maybe considered ""modern"" because of their presentation, look and feel, inclusions of interactive graphics (html 5, JavaScript, flash) and beautiful illustrations on the website. Some may consider your website old because it visually looks like ... well old website :( (pre-drupal,wordpress even pre-flash)
Your website looks very plainly a very simplistic design (which is good thing) but is not appealing visually. You should try and change your layout, integrate your logo better into your site and also try to add an animated banner. Also the ""thanks a lot"" is a little old fashioned.
You really don't have to look very hard to find cool and inspirational designs on the internet :)  

Most of today's websites which maybe considered modern are made using Drupal, Wordpress, Joomla or another CMS (but these 3 are very well known. open source and you can download them for free)  

Here's the basic layout for Drupal and what you can do:
  


For some cool buttons see here  
For a menu bar that moves with the page scroll you can see this  
For a drop down menu you can see this  
You can make a slider/slideshow on your own or use software for it like SlideShowPro or a free one - WOW Slider.You can do all sorts of things with this - make it scrollable and in many cases its a good idea to link it to your menu bar. (See here for some inspiration)  
For smooth scrolling see this    


The rest really is upto you. Make good use of the Triptych part ... it can make your site go from cool to awesome (again see smooth scrolling - this is extremely handy). Use AJAX to make your site more dynamic (because modern designs won't just relate to the visual appeal of your website but also the interaction of your site with the viewer) (jQuery makes life simple here).  


For some cool ideas of what this or a similar layout scheme can be tailored into see here.  
See this for some more inspiration     


Here's the thing mate: You can skip all of this and just do your own thing. How you design essentially comes from you. Its your way of looking at things. Wordpress, Joomla and Drupal are used extensively in modern websites - from big corporate names to everyday users. Now to go back to your title question of ""modern"" design - pardon me here, but I don't know what is the purpose of your website, your deadlines or client - But the latest in web design is HTML5. Check out the Chrome Experiments, which really are making these designs look outdated, and some cool sites built using HTML5 and JavaScript.

I'd like to learn just the standard, so that if I ever need to use just the standard, I don't snag on things like this.

Question #2: How do you cope without objects in C? I program as a hobby, and I have not yet used a language that does not have Objects (a.k.a. OO concepts?) -- I already know some C++, and I'd like to learn how to use C on it's own. Supposedly, one way is to make a POD struct and make functions similar to StructName_constructor(), StructName_doSomething(), etc. and pass the struct instance to each function - is this the 'proper' way, or am I totally off?

EDIT: Due to some minor confusion, I am defining what my second question is more clearly: I am not asking How do I use Objects in C? I am asking How do you manage without objects in C?, a.k.a. how do you accomplish things without objects, where you'd normally use objects?

In advance, thanks a lot. I've never used a language without OOP! :) 

EDIT: As per request, here is an example of the variable declaration issue:

/* includes, or whatever */
int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    int  myInt = 5;
    printf(""myInt is %d\n"", myInt);
    int test = 4; /* This does not result in a compile error */
    printf(""Test is %d\n"", test);
    return 0;
}

c89 doesn't allow this, but c99 does. Although it's taken a long time to catch on, some compilers (including gcc) are finally starting to implement c99 features.
IMO, if you want to use OOP, you should probably stick to C++ or try out Objective C. Trying to reinvent OOP built on top of C again just doesn't make much sense.


If you insist on doing it anyway, yes, you can pass a pointer to a struct as an imitation of this -- but it's still not a good idea.

It does often make sense to pass (pointers to) structs around when you need to operate on a data structure. I would not, however, advise working very hard at grouping functions together and having them all take a pointer to a struct as their first parameter, just because that's how other languages happen to implement things.

If you happen to have a number of functions that all operate on/with a particular struct, and it really makes sense for them to all receive a pointer to that struct as their first parameter, that's great -- but don't feel obliged to force it just because C++ happens to do things that way.

Edit: As far as how you manage without objects: well, at least when I'm writing C, I tend to operate on individual characters more often. For what it's worth, in C++ I typically end up with a few relatively long lines of code; in C, I tend toward a lot of short lines instead.

There is more separation between the code and data, but to some extent they're still coupled anyway -- a binary tree (for example) still needs code to insert nodes, delete nodes, walk the tree, etc. Likewise, the code for those operations needs to know about the layout of the structure, and the names given to the pointers and such.

Personally, I tend more toward using a common naming convention in my C code, so (for a few examples) the pointers to subtrees in a binary tree are always just named left and right. If I use a linked list (rare) the pointer to the next node is always named next (and if it's doubly-linked, the other is prev). This helps a lot with being able to write code without having to spend a lot of time looking up a structure definition to figure out what name I used for something this time.

",Berins,https://superuser.com/users/452454,"First, let's make something clear. hosts file doesn't prevent domain name resolution, it only overrides what domains resolve to.

When some program tries to resolve 101com.com, your OS would normally query DNS servers for its IP address. But, if you have it in your hosts file, then 101com.com will be resolved to provided IP without DNS query.

Domain name resolution still happens, but it's handled inside OS. All programs that try to resolve domains will receive IP addresses in response, but it will be the IP you have provided instead of DNS provided one.

101com.com is not ""blacklisted"", you have only redirected its traffic to your own machine (127.0.0.1).

Now, how can we explain 101com.com in netstat's output? That's pretty simple. netstat will try to reverse lookup domain names for IPs in the third column.

101com.com still exists for you, but now it points at your computer, not theirs. If your PC says something about 101com.com, it means itself.

1945,1945,3100,Could fish in plastic bags filled with water float like that?,"I saw this gif earlier and it bothered me how the plastic water bags with fish in it are not submerged in water like they would if we don't do anything special with the water inside and outside the bag:



Then I read the comments on the corresponding Imgur page (I'm not affiliated with the post), asked my friends and figured that this could actually happen in some unusual conditions. I'm not very knowledgeable in physics, but from what I know, the sea water would have to be extremely salty so as to push out the plastic bags. Also the bags themselves must be very tight, so that the plastic material which they are made of contracts to form a spherical shape. Fish may not feel very well, as it might mean increased pressure inside the bag.

The spherical shape of the bags could probably be achieved with just high external pressure, but I'm not sure what could make the bags take a form of a drop. Perhaps if that little bit of air we see was actually so much lighter than the air outside the bags, that it would stretch up the whole bag and even raise its contents above water like that.

Are my guesses correct? What other effects could cause the illustrated state of things?

That's how much volume the bag must displace, so if the bag 'assembly' has low enough density, the remainder of the bag's volume will be above the seawater surface.

with:

The parseInt will take your string 01 through 12 and give you the integral value, then you subtract one to get the index and look up the equivalent month name (I guess, though I'm not familiar with that specific language).

In other words, the final code would be:

var date = f.task_end_date.value.split(""/"");
var months = ['Sau', 'Vas', 'Kov', 'Bal', 'Geg', 'Bir','Lie', 'Rgp', 'Rgs', 'Spa', 'Lap', 'Grd'];
date[1] = months[parseInt(date[1],10)-1];
var formattedDate = date[0] + date[1] + date[2];




You can also avoid parseInt() if you wish since Javascript will treat a string as a number (via the ToNumber operation) when you subtract one:

date[1] = months[date[1]-1];


It probably won't reduce the actual work being done since the conversion from string to numeric has to be done whether explicit or implicit (it may even be slower since the implicit conversion has to handle the possibility of hex values but it's unlikely to matter a lot either way).

So, if you value succinctness of code, it's certainly an option. I prefer the explicit version myself but you may have other priorities.

    if(date[1]==months[j]){
         date[1]=months.indexOf(months[j])+1;
     }

    date[1]='0'+date[1];
}           


with:

date[1] = months[parseInt(date[1],10)-1];


The parseInt will take your string 01 through 12 and give you the integral value, then you subtract one to get the index and look up the equivalent month name (I guess, though I'm not familiar with that specific language).

In other words, the final code would be:

var date = f.task_end_date.value.split(""/"");
var months = ['Sau', 'Vas', 'Kov', 'Bal', 'Geg', 'Bir','Lie', 'Rgp', 'Rgs', 'Spa', 'Lap', 'Grd'];
date[1] = months[parseInt(date[1],10)-1];
var formattedDate = date[0] + date[1] + date[2];




You can also avoid parseInt() if you wish since Javascript will treat a string as a number (via the ToNumber operation) when you subtract one:

date[1] = months[date[1]-1];


It probably won't reduce the actual work being done since the conversion from string to numeric has to be done whether explicit or implicit (it may even be slower since the implicit conversion has to handle the possibility of hex values but it's unlikely to matter a lot either way).

So, if you value succinctness of code, it's certainly an option. I prefer the explicit version myself but you may have other priorities.

99,99,162,Sum of vlookup values on multiple sheets,"Have 12 excel Sheets in a workbook for each month Jan-Dec.  Each sheet contains Names and leaves marked for that month in the same row and sum value for each category of leave at the end of the table.  I need to summarize these individual sheets value by looking for each person's Name in all sheets. how can I achieve this in excel....  I tried sum of vlookup from all sheet, it throws error or no result.  
",roman_bull,https://superuser.com/users/77999,"This summary will  be much easier to accomplish if you consolidate your monthly sheets into a single database sheet for the year. Then you can set up a Pivot Table that will do the summing up  by person in short order.

I suspect your sum of vlookups is throwing an error because each person takes leave in only a few of the months in a year. The way to deal with this is to wrap the lookups in IFERROR functions. So the formulas would have to look like:

 =sum(iferror(vlookup(&lt;person name&gt;,&lt;January sheet name!data range&gt;,&lt;leave column number&gt;,0),0),
      iferror(vlookup(&lt;person name&gt;,&lt;February sheet name!data range&gt;,&lt;leave column number&gt;,0),0),
      etc.
      )


This could be made slightly less awkward by setting up a lookup for each month in individual columns and then summing the results across columns.

Another alternative which I'm not very familiar with--but that might meet your needs--is the Data Consolidate command. An explanation of the command can be found here.

I highly recommend the Pivot Table approach.

So $(f^-(x_n))_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ is an increasing sequence in $\mathbb{R}$ and it is bounded by $f^+(x_1)$, so it converges. The equations above imply that $\lim_{n\to\infty} f^-(x_n) = f^-(s)$, so $f^-: [-a,a]\to \mathbb{R}$ is lower semi-continuous. A similar argument shows that $f^+$ is upper semi-continuous.

In magento's case most of the abstract classes fall in the second case.
Classes like Mage_Catalog_Model_Abstract and Mage_Core_Model_Abstract are never instantiated. They are just used as a common ancestor for other classes.
Just search in the code for extends Mage_Core_Model_Abstract.  

The ""abstract"" classes contain common behavior of all child classes but they don't actually do something without some configuration values.  

Let's take for example Mage_Core_Model_Abstract. This is a common model for all other models that map to one table (or more tables for the eav entities).  But the base class should never be instantiated.
For example you can call $model-&gt;save() on a child class because that one has a mapping to (at least) a table but you cannot call it on the abstract class. But the save method works the same for all the child models so no need to implement it in all the child classes.

3807,3807,6052,Is it usual for finished PhD students to send out physical copies of their thesis to unknown persons?,"Some time ago, a recently-graduated PhD has sent me a physical (book) copy of his dissertation. The graduate works in a somewhat-related field, but is personally entirely unknown to me (I have some loose connections to the advisor, though). I was reasonably confused by this - I personally have never heard of a custom of sending physical theses to anybody besides maybe parents. I was 100% convinced that I received the dissertation in error (also because the mailing was addressed to my name, but using a wrong department name).

Last week I by chance got hold of the graduate and told him that he sent me his thesis by accident, and asked whether he wants to have it back. He seemed confused and a little bit annoyed that I wanted to give his thesis back - it turns out he actually sent me the book on purpose, assuming that I would be interested in his work. He told me that he thought it is customary to send a finished PhD thesis to people that he thought might profit from its results.

So, is this a thing, at least in some fields? If so, why not just send the core papers or a link to a digital version of the thesis? Mailing out printed copies seems extremely expensive, and also (at least for me) very unlikely to result in anything else than me having another book gathering dust in my office shelf. I am honestly very unlikely to read an entire thesis, especially if I only have it in a dead-tree book version.

2515,2515,4013,"What's a better method, using Large Array vs SQL Joins?","I can't decide on w/c technique to go w/... although I am tempted to go the Array way as it is much more straight forward and easier/cleaner to code...

lemme explain in a simple way..

For my messaging app, I have 2 tables


Contacts - contains name, and phone number (currently 5,000+ records)
Messages - messages and the phone number, but not the name of the member


I need to list 1000 Messages, w/ the corresponding phone number and name if possible...

eg.


""Hi dude"" - from 565-1111 (John)
""Bring Cheese"" - from 565-2222 (Bieber)
""Hehehe "" - from 565-2332
""iron man is cool!"" - from 565-7748 (Arnie)


etc...

I would normally join contacts to messages via the phone number... pretty standard stuff...
(but in reality my queries are a bit more complex than a simple left join)

Now, i've been playing around w/ the idea of fetching all contacts and putting it into an array where my app/system could use it in a much easier , more straight forward and cleaner code... where:


query SELECT * contacts


and store them into an array:

contacts['555-7748'] = ""John"";
contacts['555-1111'] = ""Joe"";
contacts['555-2233'] = ""Borat"";
contacts['555-4234'] = ""Arnie"";
etc


this way i can easily lookup the NAME of the Contact via accessing the array, many times in my page/script, just by simply doing:

$name = contacts[$phoneNumber];


I have actually implemented this and it's really cool .. no more join headaches and re-querying contacts table etc.. 

now the question is.. is this OK? Practical? or could i be hitting some memory cap or something here? 

it's basically running JOIN query on EACH message my script outputs
or
store ALL THE CONTACTS/RECORDS into array (memory) and refer to that instead, making queries are more simple.. 
my only worry is, querying thousands of records into an array, may be a bit too much? or is this really OK/practical? specially since there are times when my script needs to fetch specific contacts more than once...

To add, I was also thinking of storing that array into a Session variable! lolz.. so my scripts can simply share this data.. lol 

looking forward to some good inputs
Thanks guys.



---- UPDATE as of 03-31-2013 (Sunday)  ----



Ok... I'm thinking about a totally different approach now..

1) SINCE all this is really me needing  to show the ""CONTACT NAME"" for each message for neat/presentation purposes (better to see the name of the contact on a message rather than phone number yeh?) .... 

2) and since each message will need to show 2 contact names  (receiver and sender) based on their phone numbers on the MESSAGES table..... 

3) I now am thinking of ADDING 2 fields into the MESSAGES table instead... ""sender_name"" and ""receiver_name"" ..  I have seen Bulletin board / Forum software use this technique a lot ..

4) when system receives a message , it checks for existing Contacts entry of the numbers associated w/ the message...and if it exists, get the respective names and include it into storage/insert 

5) ..problem is if during the message was received, contact info isnt available, so no NAMES are saved.. and later CONTACT info is then created... the OLD messages wont show the contact names as intended... 

6) 3 way solution... 1st, evertime a new contact is added/changed my php will make updates to all messages w/ the matching numbers... 2nd, from time to time perhaps once / month, run a ""synchronize routine"" to make sure things are in sync..  or, when a user Actually OPENS a message, mandatory routine will run to check if contact name of that particular message is still in sync w/ the contacts table information... and make updates as necessary.. 

hmmm... better approach you thing? this way, i just need to issue straight forward SELECT queries , simple, fast.. but am able to display the names.. 

then again, i still kinda find that QUICK array reference thing so cool though.. lolz

The obvious disadvantage of this circuit is the power lost in R1. This means a very low efficiency.

The LED is also on only half the time, and when it is on, has high ripple current. LEDs get less efficient as the instantaneous current increases, so this further reduces efficiency. And, it blinks at 50Hz, which to me, is very noticeable and annoying.

5362,5362,8513,A question on unbounded operators,"Assume  that $H$ is  a  separable Hilbert space.
Is there a polynomial $p(z)\in \mathbb{C}[x]$ with $deg(p)&gt;1$ with the following property?:

Every densely defined operator $A:D(A)\to D(A),\;D(A)\subset H$  with $p(A)=0$ is  necessarily  a  bounded operator on $H$.

That is the polynomial-operator equation $p(A)=0$ has only bounded solution.
",Ali Taghavi,https://mathoverflow.net/users/36688,"I do not think so.  

Observation: Without loss of generality, $p(x)$ can be taken to be monic (constant multiples won't affect either $p(A) = 0$ or boundedness).  

Case 1: $p$ is degree $2$.

By the above reduction, $p(x) = (x - \lambda)(x - \mu)$ for some $\lambda$ and $\mu$ in $\mathbb{C}$ (since $A$ clearly commutes with itself and with $I$, and since $A$ maps $D(A)$ to itself, this decomposition is reasonable).  Yet if $p(A) = 0$, take the operator $\displaystyle B = A - \frac{\lambda + \mu}{2} I$ (with the same domain), and we see that for $\displaystyle \nu = \frac{\lambda - \mu}{2}$, $B$ satisfies $(B + \nu)(B - \nu) = 0$, or $B^2 - \nu^2 = 0$.  We will show that an unbounded choice of $B$ exists, satisfying $B: D(B) \to D(B)$, hence an unbounded choice of $A$ exists, with $A: D(A) \to D(A)$.  

Subcase 1: $\nu = 0$.  Then take $H = \ell^2(\mathbb{N})$, let $H_0 = D(B)$ be the sequences with only finitely many nonzero elements, and let $B$ be the operator represented by the infinite matrix 

$$ \begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp; 1 &amp;   &amp;   &amp;   &amp;   &amp; \cdots \\
                   0 &amp; 0 &amp;   &amp;   &amp;   &amp;   &amp; \cdots \\
                     &amp;   &amp; 0 &amp; 2 &amp;   &amp;   &amp; \cdots \\
                     &amp;   &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp;   &amp;   &amp; \cdots \\
                     &amp;   &amp;   &amp;   &amp; 0 &amp; 3 &amp; \cdots \\
                     &amp;   &amp;   &amp;   &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \ddots \\
        \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \ddots \end{pmatrix},$$
which is clearly well-defined on $H_0$ and clearly maps $H_0$ to itself.  Then $B^2 = 0$, but letting $e_j$ be the $j$th basis vector, $B e_{2j} = j e_{2j - 1}$, so clearly $B$ is unbounded.

Subcase 2: $\nu \neq 0$.  Then again take $H = \ell^2(\mathbb{N})$, and $H_0$ the almost-everywhere-$0$ sequences.  We now define $B$ by the matrix 

$$ \begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp; \nu &amp;   &amp;   &amp;   &amp;   &amp; \cdots \\
                   -\nu &amp; 0 &amp;   &amp;   &amp;   &amp;   &amp; \cdots \\
                     &amp;   &amp; 0 &amp; 2\nu &amp;   &amp;   &amp; \cdots \\
                     &amp;   &amp; -\frac{1}{2}\nu &amp; 0 &amp;   &amp;   &amp; \cdots \\
                     &amp;   &amp;   &amp;   &amp; 0 &amp; 3\nu &amp; \cdots \\
                     &amp;   &amp;   &amp;   &amp; -\frac{1}{3}\nu &amp; 0 &amp; \ddots \\
        \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \ddots \end{pmatrix}.$$

Again, $B$ maps $H_0$ to itself, and $B^2 e_j = \nu^2 e_j$ for all $j$, so $B^2 = \nu^2$ on $H_0$. Yet $Be_{2j} = j e_{2j - 1}$, so $B$ is unbounded.

Case 2: $\deg p &gt; 2$.

Well, then $p(x) = q_1(x) q_2(x)$, with $\deg q_1 = 2$, $\deg q_2 \geq 1$.  Again take $H$ and $H_0$ as above, and take $A$ to be an unbounded solution to $q_1(A) = 0$, satisfying $A: D(A) \to D(A)$.  Then $p(A) = q_1(A) q_2(A) = 0 q_2(A) = 0$, and $A$ is unbounded.  [Again, my naive factoring really depends on $D(A) \subseteq D(A^n)$, hence I am strongly using the $A: D(A) \to D(A)$ fact here.] QED.

Of course, Case 2 is sort of a cheat.  I think there should be a ""natural"" example in general, since you can construct unbounded examples to $A^n = 0$ by just increasing the order of the nilpotency, and $A^n = I$ by taking positive real numbers $a_1, \dotsc, a_n$ with $a_1 a_2 \dotsc a_n = 1$ and letting the building-block matrix be

$$ \begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp; a_1 &amp; &amp; &amp; \cdots  &amp; &amp; \\
                   &amp; 0 &amp; a_2 &amp; &amp; \cdots  &amp; &amp; \\

a_n &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; &amp; \dotsc &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix} $$
Then again make a block-diagonal infinite matrix such that as we repeat the blocks, $a_3, \dotsc, a_n$ are constant, and $a_1 \to \infty$ and $a_2 \to 0$ (or somesuch).

After some time the manufacturer indicated that there is a port on the side for the pressure switch and sent a photo of one installed.  So now I know that's probably the standard way most jet pumps come so they can be externally configured to different PSI settings.

698,698,1103,Opamp Voltage Doubler Unstable (After Extended Operation),"I've been working on a circuit which would drive an industry standard pneumatic regulator (E/P transducer).  The transducer takes a standard 0-10V command signal with a typical input impedance of 6.5 kOhms.  The DAC that I've selected (ADI 12bit 8 channel) has an internal 2.5V reference and can output 0-5V.  

After researching extensively, an opamp voltage doubler seemed like a good fit.  This worked and was rock solid for about two weeks, but failed after a ~2 day period of continuous operation without warning.  Now the opamp output is close to a correct 2.0 gain but constantly fluctuates as if the output is barely stable and poorly damped.  Has anyone ever seen an opamp fail this way?  

We're using a UA7812 linear regulator to supply 12V (from 24V) to the opamp quad (LM324AN) and admittedly it may not be sufficiently heatsinked (gets wicked hot to touch). Still, the 12V supply is solid at 11.83V and voltages supplied by the DAC appear correct and stable.  The actual resistors on the board are 10k with 0.1% accuracy and each measure 9.95k precisely.  Any advice in solving the problem is tremendously appreciated!  It's essential that this be a robust circuit.

Below is our final opamp configuration (and the part number):


",Liquid Plasmas,https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/68582,"I presume that your 12V is also supplying the E-P transducer power (and perhaps other stuff) and that's why the regulator is getting hot. You should heat sink it so that the case temperature is reasonable if you want reliable operation, or use a switching regulator. The exact numbers depend on your ambient range and desired reliability, but ""wicked hot"" sounds like it exceeds the 60-70°C range that I'd like to see for general purpose applications. 

The 'fluctuation' in op-amp output could be caused by oscillations. The LM324 is fairly robust with small capacitive loads (such as could be caused by cable to the transducer), especially for gain > 1, but you may still be having problems. I suggest this kind of output circuit: 







simulate this circuit &ndash; Schematic created using CircuitLab

The input filter R4/C2 keeps high frequencies out of the input and matches the impedances looking out of the op-amp inputs so as to minimize the effect of the relatively large bias current on the LM324. The resistor R1 isolates the capacitive loading on the output from the internal output impedance of the op-amp. C1 forms a tight loop for AC to stabilize the op-amp. The feedback (R2/R3) is taken directly from the output so that R1 does not affect the output voltage when sourcing current (note that when sinking current the op-amp cannot get close to the negative rail when sinking more than 50uA or so, so the 0V output can't be approached even without R1). In most cases, the input of your transducer looks like a resistor to 0V so it's not an issue.

D1 and D2 conduct any transients to the power supply, saving U1 from damage due to ESD. R4/C2 and D1/D2 are optional as far as your immediate problem goes, R1 and C1 do the work. I strongly suggest you get that regulator temperature under control as well.

The 'fluctuation' in op-amp output could be caused by oscillations. The LM324 is fairly robust with small capacitive loads (such as could be caused by cable to the transducer), especially for gain > 1, but you may still be having problems. I suggest this kind of output circuit:

4659,4659,7383,How do I create a simple yet complex business layer?,"I'm working with a fairly complex web application. It's split up into the following layers:


Presentation - HTML
Service layer - A REST and SOAP API communicating with the business layer
Business layer - Contains the business logic.
Data access - Provides access to the storage (SQL etc)


The business layers contains classes encapsulating specific areas, such as customer registration, user management and more. The problem we are seeing is that the business layer is starting to get a bit messy. We have a single class handling customer management but as this area of the application grows more and more complex, the class grows and grows and become messy.

For example, we may have the following classes


class CustomerManager


void CreateCustomer(...)
void DeleteCustomer(...)

class UserManager


void CreateUser(..)
void DeleteUser(...) 
void ActivateUser(...)
void InactivateUser(...)
void ResetPassword(...) 



Creating a customer involves creating users as well. So CustomerManager calls misc methods in the UserManager class. As the application has evolved, creating a new customer means roughly 10 different things needs to be done except for registring the customer in the database, such as informing sales, audit logging, configuring default user accounts, creating a default configuration for the customer, notifying end-users of their auto-generated passwords and more. So CustomerManager.CreateCustomer grows to ~100 lines of fairly hairy code.

I'm trying to think of a good way to handle this but am assuming that there's some common good way to do this which I'm simply not aware of.

I've considered creating ""Task""/""Command"" classes implementing small sub-processes and then let the CustomerCreation.CreateCustomer simply execute a set of tasks. I would have more classes but they would each do less things.

I've also considering implementing some kind of global application-level event/plug-in systems where CustomerManager.CreateCustomer just creates the customer in the database and then publishes an event that the customer is created. Plug-ins/something can then subscribe to these events and do stuff such as informing sales and logging the fact. Using this method, I wouldn't have to actually update CustomerManager.CreateCustomer when I want to do more stuff which is something which feels attractive to me.

What obvious design pattern am I missing?
",Nitra,https://programmers.stackexchange.com/users/90440,"Component architecture can provide good tools for fighting complexity of the business layer. For example, notifications can be done with registering subscribers (event handlers).

Hopefully your platform already has some proven component architecture you can use, which is much better than implementing ""plugins"" from scratch.

  complexity will be a fraction of what you have now, and, more

1094,1094,1724,Law of Multiple Proportions: What is the significance of small whole numbers?,"I'm new to Chemistry and in my textbook, it describes the Law of Definite Proportions and then goes on to describe the Law of Multiple Proportions.

The example they give is carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide, where the mass ratio of oxygen to carbon in carbon dioxide is 2.67:1 and the mass ratio of oxygen to carbon in carbon monoxide is 1.33:1.

I understand the above example, and I understand that when you compare them in the following way:

2.67g (proportion of oxygen to 1g carbon in carbon dioxide)/ 1.33g (proportion of oxygen to 1g carbon in carbon monoxide) = 2.00, a small whole number.

$\frac{Mass~oxygen~to~1g~carbon~in~carbon~dioxide}{Mass~oxygen~to~1g~carbon~in~carbon~monoxide}$ = $\frac{2.67g}{1.33g}$ = 2.00

My textbook doesn't describe what a small whole number is, or what it means... just that, in this example, 2.00 is a small whole number.

What is the significance of the 2.00?

I understand that carbon dioxide has double the oxygen. Is this where the 2.00 plays a role?

The law is valid for a large variety of binary compounds simply by virtue of the fact that there is typically a limited number of permutations in which two given elements can be combined to yield a stable compound.

As mentioned before, I would say 'Dimension: ""1""' in this place. But what about the unit? $\text m/\text s$ divided by $\text m/\text s$ is equal to one. But is the number one a unit by definition? Or should one say that the Mach number has no unit and therefore 'Unit: ""-""'?
",LaRiFaRi,https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/29759,"The number $1$ may be linguistically described as ""unity"". This very number is the original source of various words in the terminology, like the ""unit matrix"" (a matrix behaving like the number $1$).

It is a convention to write down that dimensionless quantities like the Mach number have units $1$ because the multiplication by $1$ changes nothing about the result – this is the counterpart of the multiplication by another unit like ${\rm m/s}$. 

It just looks more coherent to write the unit $1$ into the tables. But verbally, one may also say that quantities with ""this unit"" have no units whatsoever. They are dimensionless. As long as one understands the logic, there's no problem in following these somewhat inconsistent conventions in which we sometimes say the units to be $1$ and sometimes we say that the units aren't there. 

In the tables, the ""unit"" column means ""the ratio of the full quantity and its numerical value"". With this definition, the result may be calculated as $1$ without any problems. It's similar to the task to compute budget deficits as the difference of revenue and expenses. If the latter two are equal, the difference is just $0$. One may write $0$ although he could also write it as $-$ and say that the difference ""doesn't exist"". The numbers $0$ and $1$ play the role of the ""neutral objects"" for addition and multiplication, respectively.

5247,5247,8344,Is there a way to fill your tires with nitrogen?,"I know this is a rather controversial issue. I was skeptical as well before doing this on my car, and I have not refilled my car tires for several months. Before that I needed to adjust the pressure every couple of months at least. 

Now I think it is a good idea to try this for our bikes. Especially since, when I see I need to fill up my bike tires, I get too lazy and give up the ride altogether. 

Is there a way to do this at home?

EDIT:
I thought I'd update the question for people who come and read later:  

Thanks for all the comments, I drive a lot (30kmiles/year) and I saw (to my surprise) a significant difference with nitrogen. 

I understand the reasoning with losing oxygen over time and increasing the N2 concentration but in practice that does not happen fast enough.  

I think I'll look into Helium/Argon and I'll update you if I managed to do something interesting. 

And I live in a small place I don't like to have a large pump but that is exactly why pumping is such a chore for me,

4862,4862,7735,struts2+spring3: passing a variable from action to jsp (javascript code),"First of all, thank you very much to all these that are trying to solve our problems in this forum;)

I am developing a web application with struts2+spring3. And I have a question about how to pass a variable (an array of arrays) from the action class to the jsp page.

I know that the only you need to do is to declare a private variable in my action and a get method for that variable and then its possible to access these variable from the jsp, I have done it and it works.

public class Workspace extends ActionSupport {

private String[][] objects=null;

public String[][] getObjects() {
    return objects;
}

public String execute() throws Exception{


The problem is that I want to access to this variable from the javascript code before loading the whole web page.

I have tried by different ways but it is never working.

$(function() {
var objectsMap=new Array();

    $(document).ready(function() {
          objectsMap = $objects;
    });


neither works (the alert says: ""Value: undefined""):

    &lt;s:set name=""auxObj"" value=""%{objects}""/&gt;
    &lt;script&gt;
        alert(""Value: ""+$(""#auxObj"").val());
    &lt;/script&gt;


Anyone have idea about how could I do that?

Edit: John Bentin showed that this is false in general, even with $\beta \in \Bbb{Q}$. Is this true at least for $\beta$ algebraic integer?

All I know so far is that if $\beta$ is a Pisot integer, i.e. if it is a real algebraic integer greater than $1$ with every conjugate lying in the unit circle, then $\alpha \in \Bbb{Q}(\beta)$ if and only if it has an ultimately periodic expansion (which is stronger than my question).

* different text


The result would be that after the replacement the file containing the first block of text, will now contain the second string (the rest of the file is unchanged).

Part of the problem is that I have to find the list of files to be updated in the file system, I guess I can use grep for that (though again that's not as easy to do with multiline strings) then pipe it in sed maybe?

Is there an easy way to do this? Sed is an option but it's awkward because I have to add \n etc. Is there a way to say ""take the input from this file, match it in those files, then replace it with teh content of this other file"" ?

5026,5026,8002,Windows Software to Mount Volume/Partition Image File,"Last night I had a BSOD a couple of minutes after moving a file. After a reboot, I found that the file was gone (it was deleted from the source partition and not present on the destination).

I took an image of the source volume (ie from the Boot Sector to the last cluster of the partition). Then I wrote a program to extract the unused clusters from a disk and save them as files.

Some of the free clusters on the original volume have now been overwritten so I need to use the image to do my final extraction. That means I need some software that can mount a volume/partition image, but all of the image mounting software I can find can only mount disk images (ie from the MBR—the master partition table—on).

Does anyone know of (hopefully free) Windows software that can do this?

I’ve already tried (without success): VirtualCloneDrive, DaemonTools, VirtualFloppyDrive (and probably a couple of others I can’t think of). They all either nag that the file is no good, or try to mount it, resulting in a disk that Windows complains has an unknown/corrupt filesystem.

543,543,855,Creating a static C struct containing strings,"I'm trying to create a dynamic library in Rust that exports a struct as a symbol that will be loaded into a C program via dlopen().

However, I'm was running into some segfaults when accessing the second string in the struct, so I made a small test program to try figure out what I'm doing wrong.

This is the Rust code (test.rs), compiled with ""rustc --crate-type dylib test.rs"":

#[repr(C)]
pub struct PluginDesc {
    name: &amp;'static str,
    version: &amp;'static str,
    description: &amp;'static str
}


#[no_mangle]
pub static PLUGIN_DESC: PluginDesc = PluginDesc {
    name: ""Test Plugin\0"",
    version: ""1.0\0"",
    description: ""Test Rust Plugin\0""
};


and here is the C program that attempts to load the library (test.c), compiled with ""gcc test.c -ldl -o test"":

#include &lt;dlfcn.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;


typedef struct {
    const char *name;
    const char *version;
    const char *description;
} plugin_desc;


int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    void *handle;
    plugin_desc *desc;

    handle = dlopen(""./libtest.so"", RTLD_LOCAL | RTLD_LAZY);
    if (!handle) {
        printf(""failed to dlopen: %s\n"", dlerror());
        return 1;
    }

    desc = (plugin_desc *) dlsym(handle, ""PLUGIN_DESC"");
    if (!desc) {
        printf(""failed to dlsym: %s\n"", dlerror());
        return 1;
    }

    printf(""name: %p\n"", desc-&gt;name);
    printf(""version: %p\n"", desc-&gt;version);
    printf(""description: %p\n"", desc-&gt;description);

    return 0;
}


This is the output:

name: 0x7fa59ef8d750
version: 0xc
description: 0x7fa59ef8d75c


As you can see, the address of desc->version is actually 0xc (12), which is the length of the first string. So it looks like the struct that gets packed into the library also contains the string length after the memory address.

Am I using the wrong string type here? As you can see I had to also make the strings NULL terminated manually. I tried to use the CString wrapper but that does not seem to work in this case (""static items are not allowed to have destructors"").

I'm running the latest Rust nightly on Linux:

Create Product ViewModel:

5117,5117,8137,Ethical Disclosure of Professional Knowledge in PhD Dissertation,"I have just completed my PhD. Although my examiners did not raise any concerns, I have been grappling with an ethical issue for the entire duration of my candidature. 

The issue concerns professional knowledge of the field on which my research is based. This is an issue of concern because I am employed in the field and have access to information that is generally not publicly available (but is available to me as an employee) or only found in hard-to-get industry publications (e.g. newsletters). These publications are hard-to-get because of their specialised nature and limited circulation. 

Disclosing this information creates a potential conflict of interest for me (because of reasons associated with commercial-in-confidence, breach of trust etc.). It gets even worse because I am often actively involved in generating this information as part of various negotiations I am required to have with third parties (in my capacity as an employee). As an example, I draft policy speeches for my CEO so this has the effect of quoting my own work in my dissertation (but attributed to my CEO in the citation and bibliography!)  

To resolve this matter, I have declared (categorically) this conflict of interest (several times in my dissertation) (although I don't identify myself as the ghost writer). I have also put whatever information I thought could be ethically disclosed in the relevant context (e.g. cited the publicly available newsletter, where possible). This was to ensure future researchers could benefit from this 'inside' knowledge. I have stated this as one of the contributions to knowledge that my dissertation is making.

I must add that the professional knowledge does not contradict or undermine my research, so I am certainly not withholding the information for this reason. On the contrary, this information enhances the main arguments of my study (so omitting it presents a significant dilemma for me).

i would love to hear how else could this matter be resolved.

5092,5092,8099,Vixion IRUX Tablet battery will not charge,"I bought this tablet recently in Tenerife.  Can find no information about the manufacturer.  

Now the battery will not charge through the mains adapter. It did charge at first.  However, I have found it does charge through USB connection to my PC.
When it charged previously a light at the connector would be red.  When it was not charging it would be green.  It is red while USB connected. 

Also it tells me now that it is charging, but if I remove the USB connection it stops charging. It has a screen showing battery condition in the form of a graph.  I could see the graph of battery % decreasing gradually.  A few days ago there was a sudden drop as if some App had used a lot of power.  

I decided to remove all Apps and did a factory reset.  This made no difference regarding the failure to charge. I have tried shutting down completely (hold the off button for a while and it asks if I want to power off)  

This made no difference.
Any advice please?

Edit #1: Thanks ce4 for your response. The charger is stated to be 5v and when I check it with a voltmeter, it shows 5.2v. Also I have tried pushing the plug into the tablet to varying amounts and makes no difference. Another point maybe I didn't make clear is that when I connect with USB only, the light does not come on but the device tells me it is charging.

But when I connect the power supply as well, the light comes on red as if indicating charging. But when I remove the USB leaving the power supply connected, the light goes back to green and is not charging from the power supply.

Despite apparently charging on USB, the percentage of battery left charged has not yet increased from 10%. I understand that USB cannot deliver high current. It appears you are right - something wrong with the charger - maybe it is not the correct one for this model - I guess it needs to be able to deliver power at a higher current level?

78,78,127,Opamp Voltage Doubler Unstable (After Extended Operation),"I've been working on a circuit which would drive an industry standard pneumatic regulator (E/P transducer).  The transducer takes a standard 0-10V command signal with a typical input impedance of 6.5 kOhms.  The DAC that I've selected (ADI 12bit 8 channel) has an internal 2.5V reference and can output 0-5V.  

After researching extensively, an opamp voltage doubler seemed like a good fit.  This worked and was rock solid for about two weeks, but failed after a ~2 day period of continuous operation without warning.  Now the opamp output is close to a correct 2.0 gain but constantly fluctuates as if the output is barely stable and poorly damped.  Has anyone ever seen an opamp fail this way?  

We're using a UA7812 linear regulator to supply 12V (from 24V) to the opamp quad (LM324AN) and admittedly it may not be sufficiently heatsinked (gets wicked hot to touch). Still, the 12V supply is solid at 11.83V and voltages supplied by the DAC appear correct and stable.  The actual resistors on the board are 10k with 0.1% accuracy and each measure 9.95k precisely.  Any advice in solving the problem is tremendously appreciated!  It's essential that this be a robust circuit.

Below is our final opamp configuration (and the part number):


",Liquid Plasmas,https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/68582,"I'm just guessing but your description makes me think that the pneumatic regulator is requiring a lot more current that you think.  I base this on you saying that your 7812 regulator is running so hot.

Couple of things:

1) You don't need the regulator.  The LM324 is good for a maximum supply voltage of 34 (36?) Vdc.

2) Add an emitter follower to the output of the op-amp.  I'd be tempted to use a physically-large transistor just because of dissipation issues.  NPN, TO-220 package, gain  (Hfe) of at least 100.  Collector goes to +24V, Base comes from output of op-amp, Emitter feeds both the pneumatic regulator and the right-hand end of R34.  Note that the transistor is inside the feedback loop and doesn't introduce any error.

Question: is your regulator a voltage-input device or current-input?  My company makes interface cards like this for a variety of different actuators and the ones that we work with are all current-input devices.  We drive them with a low-frequency PWM signal where the output current is proportional to the control input.  This eliminates temperature effects on the actuator's solenoid coil and the vibration that the low-frequency PWM produces reduces stiction in the actuator.

Is there a cleaner approach that I am missing?

I am currently using the ""cycles"" renderer, but I am open to suggestions for any other renderer. Thanks!

I want to use the google developed calendar app as my main calendar app. My phone (a Galaxy S2) came with a samsung developed calendar app (both very conveniently named ""Calendar"").

I have been able to do this by going to settings->Notifications in the samsung app and toggling to ""Off"".

However, as soon as I restart the device, the notifications are back on their original settings. Anyone else experience this? Anyone know how to make the settings stick?

EDIT: I notice the notification settings of the google developed app (sound, default reminder time, popup) are also not sticking after reboot. Is my device broken? It seems to only be for calendar. Gmail and other apps hold their settings fine.

4990,4990,7944,abelian higgs vortices,"Dear fellow mathematicians,
during some gauge-theoretic explorations
I've stumble upon a recent paper by Nick Manton on Abelian higgs vortices where he studies Abelian higgs ""vortices"" on hyperbolic surfaces.
Does anyone have any historical knowledge of whether the word vortex in this context have any connection with point vortices from fluid dynamics? 
",swallowtail ,https://mathoverflow.net/users/10137,"I expect that this terminology came from an analogy of an analogy. 

Quoting from Quantum Field Theory of Anyons, by Fröhlich and Marchetti (1988), ""Particles with real spin and intermediate statistics have been called 'anyons' by Wilczek [1]. He suggested that electrically charged magnetic vortices, occuring in certain Higgs models, may be examples of such particles."" 

So certain types of anyons can reasonably be, and have been, called vortices.

",n8gard,https://dba.stackexchange.com/users/71684,"There are two ways to run a replica. You can use either, or both together:


Streaming replication, where the replica makes a PostgreSQL protocol connection to the standby as configured with primary_conninfo in recovery.conf; or
WAL shipping, where the replica runs a restore_command (set in recovery.conf that fetches WAL archives to replay.


See recovery.conf.

Both require that standby_mode be set in recovery.conf.

WAL-E is designed to be used as an archive_command on the master, to store WAL into S3, then as a recovery_command on the replica to fetch WAL. There is no need for a streaming replication connection. You can add one anyway, and it will be used where available, and the system will fall back to WAL archive recovery if it can't connect over streaming replication. Or you can just use WAL-based archiving.

The main advantage of using streaming replication as well is that it's more timely; you don't have to wait until an entire WAL archive is filled and shipped before the replica sees the changes.

And when I say ""simple"" I mean not only the amount of lines of code, but also the ease of debugging/ flaws search.

        self.view = QtGui.QGraphicsView()
        self.setCentralWidget(self.view)
        self.view.setScene(self.scene)
        self.scene.addItem(Square(0,0,50,50))

class Scene(QtGui.QGraphicsScene):

    def mousePressEvent(self, e):

When you click the mouse in the scene you should see a print statement telling you that you clicked either on the square or on nothing (ie. None). This works if you just start the program and click on the square.

Now drag the square away from the upper left corner and click on it again. This time itemAt() return None even when you click on the square.

Can such a thing be done?  I have a vague idea that I might make a text file with a list of the new names and call that list @newnames.  I would make another array out of the current file names, and call it @oldnames.  I'd then do some kind of for loop where each element $i in @oldnames is replaced by the corresponding $i in @newnames.

I don't know how to make an array out of my current file names, though, and so I'm not sure if this vague idea is on the right track.  I keep my files with the messed-up names in a directory called 'oldnames'. The below is my attempt to make an array out of the file names in that directory:

#!/usr/bin/perl -w
use strict; use warnings;

my $dir = 'oldnames';
opendir ('oldnames', $dir) or die ""cannot open dir $dir: $!"";
my @file = readdir 'oldnames';
closedir 'oldnames';

print ""@file\n"";

",user2585169,https://stackoverflow.com/users/2585169,"Can you do this with rename? It does allow you to use perl code and expressions as arguments if I recall.

The real answer is the one by @chrsblck it does some checks and doesn't make a mess. 

For comparison here is a messy one liner that may suffice.  It relies on you providing a list of equivalent new file names that will rename your list of old files in the correct order.  Perhaps for your situation (where you don't want to do any programmatic transformation of the files names) you could just use a shell loop (see the end of this post) reading lists of new and old names from a file. A better perl solution would be to put both of these file name lists into two columns and then that file using the -a switch , @F and  then useFile::Copy to copy the files around. 

Anyway, below are some suggestions. 

First, set things up: 

 % vim newfilenames.txt # list new names one per line corresponding to old names.
 % wc -l newfilenames.txt # the same number of new names as files in ./oldfiles/
  8 newfilenames.txt
 % ls -1 oldfiles  # 8 files rename these in order to list from newfilenames.txt

With files arranged as above, copy everything over:

perl -MFile::Copy -E 'opendir($dh , oldfiles); @newfiles=`cat newfilenames.txt`; chomp @newfiles; @oldfiles = sort grep(/^.+\..+$/, readdir $dh); END {for $i (0..$#oldfiles){copy(""oldfiles/$oldfiles[$i]"", ""newfiles/$newfiles[$i]""); }}'


Not pretty: you have to grep andsort on @oldfiles to get rid of . .. and put the array elments in order. And there's always the risk that a typo could make a mess and it would be hard to figure out.
If you put the old and new names in a couple of files you could just do this with this with a shell script:

for i in `cat ../oldfilenames.txt` ; do ; done; for n in `cat ../newfilenames.txt`; do cp $i $n;


or just cd into  the directory with the old files and do:

mkdir new
for i in * ; do ; done; for n in `cat ../newfilenames.txt`; do cp $i new/$n;

A better perl solution would be to put both of these file name lists into two columns and then that file using the -a switch , @F and  then useFile::Copy to copy the files around. 

Anyway, below are some suggestions. 

First, set things up: 

 % vim newfilenames.txt # list new names one per line corresponding to old names.
 % wc -l newfilenames.txt # the same number of new names as files in ./oldfiles/
  8 newfilenames.txt
 % ls -1 oldfiles  # 8 files rename these in order to list from newfilenames.txt

 newSEACODI-sww2320H-sww24_07H_R.5_sww2320H_sww2403F.fsa


With files arranged as above, copy everything over:

perl -MFile::Copy -E 'opendir($dh , oldfiles); @newfiles=`cat newfilenames.txt`; chomp @newfiles; @oldfiles = sort grep(/^.+\..+$/, readdir $dh); END {for $i (0..$#oldfiles){copy(""oldfiles/$oldfiles[$i]"", ""newfiles/$newfiles[$i]""); }}'


Not pretty: you have to grep andsort on @oldfiles to get rid of . .. and put the array elments in order. And there's always the risk that a typo could make a mess and it would be hard to figure out.
If you put the old and new names in a couple of files you could just do this with this with a shell script:

for i in `cat ../oldfilenames.txt` ; do ; done; for n in `cat ../newfilenames.txt`; do cp $i $n;


or just cd into  the directory with the old files and do:

mkdir new
for i in * ; do ; done; for n in `cat ../newfilenames.txt`; do cp $i new/$n;


Good luck!

  let $\alpha$ be a infinite cardinal , show that:
  $$\alpha=\aleph_{0}\alpha$$
  where $\aleph_{0}$ is the cardinality of the natural numbers is denoted aleph-null


this equation is from a book,and I can't prove it,and the author say this is important equation,and can't prove it.Thank you for you help
",china math,https://math.stackexchange.com/users/94077,"Recall that $\aleph_\alpha$ is the cardinality of the $\alpha$-th [infinite] initial ordinal, denoted by $\omega_\alpha$.

For this proof you will need an extra fact:


  If $\alpha$ is an uncountable ordinal then $|\alpha|=|\{\delta&lt;\alpha\mid\delta\text{ is a limit ordinal}\}|$.


If $\alpha=0$ then you can prove directly that $\aleph_0\cdot\aleph_0=\aleph_0$ by using a pairing function.

Now define an equivalence relation on the ordinals below $\omega_\alpha$, $\xi\sim\zeta$ if there are only finitely many ordinals between $\xi$ and $\zeta$. I will leave you to verify that this is an equivalence relation. $\omega_\alpha$ is well-ordered, each equivalence class has a least element, and it is a limit ordinal, or zero. Otherwise its predecessor is in the same equivalence class, which is a contradiction to the minimality. And of course, different limit ordinals cannot be in the same equivalence class, because they have infinitely many ordinals between them.

So we have $\aleph_\alpha$ equivalence classes; and $\aleph_0$ points in each of the classes. Therefore $|\omega_\delta|=\aleph_\alpha\cdot\aleph_0$. Note that the axiom of choice wasn't used here, because we have a canonical ordering of each equivalence class.

Now. How to prove the fact? Usually the proof goes through defining the above equivalence relation and using the fact that $\aleph_0\cdot\aleph_\alpha=\aleph_\alpha$. So we can't really use that here. But we can use transfinite induction. It suffices to prove this for the initial ordinals, because every limit ordinal which is not an initial ordinal is either countable, or equipotent with its initial ordinal.

Suppose that for $\alpha$ it is true that for all $\beta&lt;\alpha$, either $\beta=0$ or there are $\aleph_\beta$ limit ordinals below $\omega_\beta$. Then it holds that $\aleph_0\cdot\aleph_\beta=\aleph_\beta$ for those $\beta$'s.

By contradiction there are less than $\aleph_\alpha$ limit ordinals below $\omega_\alpha$, then there is some $\beta&lt;\alpha$ such that $|\{\delta&lt;\omega_\alpha\mid\delta\text{ is a limit ordinal}\}|=\aleph_\beta$. Consider the above equivalence relation defined on $\omega_\alpha$, then it only has $\aleph_\beta$ equivalence classes, and therefore $\aleph_\beta=\aleph_\beta\cdot\aleph_0=\aleph_\alpha$, but $\beta&lt;\alpha$ and that is impossible. $\square$

So at the end we have to resort to transfinite recursion if we want to use the structure of ordinals, but it's just a scary term, it's not that scary once you understand this extremely useful technique.



Now, using the axiom of choice if $\alpha$ is an infinite cardinal then it is an $\aleph$ number. However, some people define ""cardinal"" as an $\aleph$ number to begin with, in which case you don't use the axiom of choice.

In the general form, where cardinal need not be an $\aleph$ number, it is consistent with the failure of the axiom of choice that there are cardinals which do not satisfy this property.

5084,5084,8090,Quicken 2008 Online Balance vs. Ending Balance?,"I'm using Quicken 2008, I'm pondering upgrading to the 2010 edition, but...I'm having some problems; the online balance says I have like 3,000 some dollars and my Ending Balance says that I have like 600 dollars.

I'm totally confused by this. My thought is that the online balance is what the bank believes I have in the bank. But I really don't know how much money I have right now. Is it 3,000 or is it 600? I mean that's a really large gap there.

Why are there two different balances and what do they both mean?

Please note that I get my transaction input from two different places:


My PDA has Pocket Quicken installed on it and I sync this up with my Q2008 installation.
All three of the Financial institutions that I use all sync up with my installation Q2008.


I also read somewhere that if you have duplicate transactions in your Q2008 you should delete them. Does either the 2008 or 2010 edition have support for this, and how do you go about using it to iron out the errors in your account (if they are indeed errors...)

Data errors:  If you do have extraneous or missing transactions, it could throw off the Quicken balance until they're corrected.  I use Microsoft Money and monitor my transactions carefully and I won't change that practice if I switch to other software.  When it comes to financial software:  ""trust, but verify.""  Not only do the financial software people have to get it right &ndash; so does your bank!  Perhaps I'm jaded; my first experience downloading transactions didn't go very well :-)
Timing: Another possible discrepancy is that your bank's online balance may be reflecting transactions that are pending.  For instance, I've noticed before that my credit card ""available balance"" as reported online by my financial institution reflected some charges that were authorized but not yet posted to the account.  It is especially noticeable when there's a large charge.  If your bank ""knows about"" transactions that are not yet posted, it might reflect the expected amounts in your online balance, whereas Quicken would have no transaction detail yet so it would be unable to factor them into the calculation of the ending balance.

I'm able to match messages, that contain more than one keyword in given field (for example, to match many keywords in From field, I use one OR two OR three). But, can I write one filter, that will match these keywords in both From field and message's body? So, it will apply given filter rule, no matter, if keyword was found in this or that field?

2697,2697,4300,k-center algorithm in one-dimensional space,"I'm aware of the general k-center approximation algorithm, but my professor (this is a question from a CS class) says that in a one-dimensional space, the problem can be solved (optimal solution found, not an approximation) in O(n^2) polynomial time without depending on k or using dynamic programming.

A general description of the k-center problem: Given a set of nodes in an n-dimensional space, cluster them into k clusters such that the ""radius"" of each cluster (distance from furthest node to its center node) is minimized. A more formal and detailed description can be found at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_k-center

As you might expect, I can't figure out how this is possible. The part currently causing me problems is how the runtime can not rely on k.

The nature of the problem causes me to try to step through the nodes on a sort of number line and try to find points to put boundaries, marking off the edges of each cluster that way. But this would require a runtime based on k.

The O(n^2) runtime though makes me think it might involve filling out an nxn array with the distance between two nodes in each entry.

Any explanation on how this is works or tips on how to figure it out would be very helpful.

6068,6068,9631,Goalkeeper Jumping Algorithm?,"This may be a ""best way to"" question, so may be susceptible to opinion-based answers (which is ok for me). But I would also like if there are any tutorials , research papers , etc.

I'm trying to make a 3D free kick game, and I want to decide on the Goalkeeper algorithm.

Usually (and in my game) the shot is a function of direction , power and swerve. Maybe wind can be a factor too. So the shots trajectory is pre-deterministic, i.e., the point that intersects the goal (or out) plane is determined as soon as the shot fires.

So what could be a good approach for the goalkeeper to jump (or walk) ?

I have two approaches in mind :

1- determine the point, and jump to there. 
2- when the ball is closer than a threshold distance, estimate the point by the ball's velocity vector, and jump to there.

The problem with the first approach is, goalkeeper will always save the shot, which I want to prevent. So there should be some kind of randomness, or the goalkeeper's ability to jump and walk will be restricted.

The problem with the second approach is, when there is a high amount of swerve, the goalkeeper will always fail to save the shot.

So how could these approaches be better?

Thanks for any help !

170,170,268,Is there a console command to give vendors gold to help with selling?,"Last night, I made enough potions from ingredients in storage to be sold for approximately 900,000 septims. My practice in times past would be to go to fences in round-robin fashion in Markarth, Solitude, Windhelm, and Honningbrew Meadery to sell off items since they have 5,000 septims each. In the interest of saving and not wasting time, I used the command additem f 495000 on Mallus Maccius ""(0002ba8f) in the meadery and started selling potions, but once he gave me 5,000 septims, things got weird. Items can still be sold for him like normal, but my gold no longer increases, and his does not decrease below 495,000. The Wikia article Console Commands (Skyrim) has this to say about the command: Use on a merchant to set the amount of barter gold. This gold may not go to your inventory when selling items to the vendor.

Question: Is there a way to get around this problem? Is there another command or target on which to act that would allow me to accomplish what is being attempted?

Rejected Answers:


Remove the items and give yourself gold for the items [imprecise on gold calculations or time consuming; also has same problem with leveling up speech]
Continue what you are doing but give yourself gold when finished [while this allows leveling up speech, there is imprecision on gold calculations without being time consuming]
Keep going to your fences round-robin style to sell your items [this is to be avoided; the goal is to save time even if it breaks immersion slightly]
Download mod name_goes_here so merchants have more/infinite gold [my internet connection's proxy prevents such downloads; it is extremely inconvenient to access other internet connections]
Go to web_site_url to read/watch a tutorial on how to accomplish what you are trying to do [see last point; proxy probably blocks the web site, and it is close to impossible to get a different internet connection]

-Why are we even using a trica/diac combo above. Why would a circuit consisting of just the fuse, switch and primary not be sufficient for charging the battery?

-If we do go ahead with the above combo, what is the use of the resistor/capacitor combo attached in parallel above the triac?

Thanks

1275,1275,2009,How the hypergeometric distribution sums to 1?,"The hypergeometric distribution is defined for $\max(0, n+K-N)\leq k\leq \min(K,n).$
But, when we use Vandermonde's identity to prove that probabilities sum to $1$, then we use the range of $0\leq k \leq n.$ I wonder how this is justified?
",Silent,https://stats.stackexchange.com/users/30971,"The reference mentions that this identity is from combinatorics: that is, it counts things.  

What does it count?  Consider $N$ objects.  Once and for all, divide those $n$ things into a group of $K$ of them, which I will call ""red,"" and the remainder, which I will call ""blue.""  Each subset of $n$ such objects determines, and is determined by, its red objects and its blue objects.  The number of such sets with $k$ red objects (and therefore $n-k$ blue objects) equals the number of ways to choose $k$ red objects from all $K$ ones (written $\color{red}{\binom{K}{k}}$) times the number of ways to choose the remaining $n-k$ blue objects from all the $N-K$ ones (written $\color{blue}{\binom{N-K}{n-k}}$).

Now if $k$ is not between $0$ and $K$, then there is no $k$-element subset of $K$ things, so $\binom{K}{k}=0$ in such cases.  Similarly, $\binom{N-K}{n-k}=0$ if $n-k$ is not between $0$ and $N-K$.  (This not only makes sense, it is actually how good software will evaluate these quantities.  Ask R, for instance, to compute choose(5,6) or choose(5,-1): it will return the correct value of $0$ in both cases.)

Summing over all possible numbers $k$ shows that 

$$\binom{N}{n} = \sum_k \color{red}{\binom{K}{k}}\color{blue}{\binom{N-K}{n-k}}$$

and as you read this you should say to yourself ""any $n$ objects are comprised of some number $k$ of red objects and the remaining $n-k$ blue objects.""

The sum needs to include all $k$ for which both the terms $\color{red}{\binom{K}{k}}$ and $\color{blue}{\binom{N-K}{n-k}}$ are nonzero, but it's fine to include any other values of $k$ because they will just introduce some extra zeros into the sum, which does not change it.  We just need to make sure all relevant $k$ are included. It suffices to find an obvious lower bound for it ($0$ will do nicely and is more practicable than $-\infty$!) and an obvious upper bound ($N$ works because we cannot find more than $N$ objects altogether).  A slightly better upper bound is $n$ (because $k$ counts the red objects in a set of $n$ things).  Thus, writing these bounds explicitly and dividing both sides by $\binom{N}{n}$, we obtain

$$1 = \sum_{0\le k\le n}\frac{\color{red}{\binom{K}{k}}\color{blue}{\binom{N-K}{n-k}}}{\binom{N}{n}} .$$

Despite the notation, this formula does not implicitly assert that all values of $k$ in the range from $0$ to $n$ can occur in this distribution.  About the only reason to fiddle with the inequalities and figure out what the smallest possible range of $k$ can be would be for writing programs that loop over these values: that might save a little time adding up some zeros.

421,421,653,"""God is Fire"": Trying to Source an Analogy for Prayer","I remember reading once a very clever analogy, which I was sure that I had found in the writings of Yeshayahu Leibowitz (who sourced it, from memory, in the writings of the Rav, R' Yosef Ber Soloveitchik, who himself sourced it in the Rambam), but I can no longer locate it at all. In essence, the analogy stated that God is like fire. Different objects, when dropped into the fire, react differently. Some become hard. Some become soft. Some let off smoke. Some change their hue. Some make a noise. Some might explode. But while all of these different reactions can be found, at no stage is the fire anything other than a fire; the difference in responses to it is to be found in the different objects that come into contact with it.

So too, the analogy concluded, when it comes to our relationship with God. When we pray, we change ourselves in order that God might interact more favourably with us. We do not hope for God to change in any way, but for ourselves to change instead. God's influence upon the world is constant and unchanging; it is we who are in flux.

Does this analogy sound familiar to anybody? If you can direct me to a printed source (be it in the writings of the Rav, or Prof. Leibowitz, or whomever it was who came up with this), I would be much obliged.

The Rambam cites Deuteronomy 4:24 in Yesodei haTorah 2:4


  What is meant by the prophets' statements that they saw an angel of
  fire or with wings? All these are prophetic visions and parables, as
  [Deuteronomy 4:24] states: ""God, your Lord, is consuming fire,"" though
  He is not fire and [the description of Him in this manner] is only
  metaphoric. Similarly, [Psalms 104:4] states: ""He makes His angels as
  winds....""

  ""(God) is a destroying (lit. eating) fire"" (Deut. iv. 24), that is, He
  destroys those who rebel against Him, as the fire destroys everything
  that comes within its reach. Instances of this kind are very
  frequent."" (Guide for the Perplexed 1:30)

2785,2785,4436,How do I chose a good camera for texture hunting?,"Texture hunting is the photography of walls, surfaces, artefacts, etc, typically outdoors, with the intention of using the photos in a computer game.  The photo could be of a brick or concrete wall, a chain link face, a door / window, or whatever.  It is also possible to photograph a white wall that has been damaged or stained in some way, process it in various ways, and use this as a mask on top of other textures, in order to get a new damaged variant.

Textures are typically lighting-neutral and extremely sharp.  The computer game will compute its own lighting and shadows.  One must avoid having a shadow across the subject, as this will only have to be removed in post-processing.  Typically, texture hunting is done on cloudy days where there is a uniform soft light from the sky.

1024×1024 is a reasonable size of the final texture, but it's usually photographed at a higher res, photoshopped considerably, and then sized down.  The subject of the photo could be something like 5 metres × 5 metres.  The idea is that every pixel is being used to the fullest effect to convey the character of the surface.  Textures are often photoshopped to become seamless so they can be repeated across a large surface in game.

Textures are usually shot perpendicular to the wall as much as possible, otherwise distortion correction is required.  Sometimes you can take a photo from further away and zoom in to get a better view of a high wall.

It is often quite hard to find a surface in the real world that has an interesting texture and is easy to photograph from the right angle.  In particular, taking photos of the floor is challenging because you need to be several metres above it, looking down.  Leaning out of windows / over bridges, or holding up a tripod are solutions.

One thing that concerns me is that some cameras do image processing on the digital image.  Really, the artist has to be doing all of the image processing offline, in photoshop or similar.  I often see digital camera photos with edge enhancement artefacts in high contrast areas.  Perhaps raw shooting mode is the answer to this?

Shooting digital photos with greater colour depth than ""8 bit per channel"" might also be useful to avoid banding when increasing contrast during post-processing.

Another thing is lens distortion — since we need to photograph flat surfaces.  Either the camera has to be good at it, or it should be possible to turn it off so the processing can be done manually by an artist.

How do I find a camera which meets these requirements?

5098,5098,8107,Is there an analogue of the jordan normal form of an nilpotent linear transform of a polynomial ring?,"Is there an analogue of the Jordan Normal Form for an infinite dimensional vector space?

In general I think the answer is no.  It's been awhile since I studied it, but I'm pretty sure something would go wrong in distinguishing eigenvalues for an infinite dimensional space.  Normally, for infinite dimensional vector spaces, you have some topology that allows you to define compact operators, et cetera, that are easier to study.  But in my specific case I'm looking at an nilpotent linear map $D: F[X] \to F[X]$, where $F$ is a finite field.  I'm actually trying to find the kernel of said map.  I hope that a transformation to a suitably friendly basis would help (hence why I'm asking about jordan normal forms!).  Is $F[x]$ close enough to finite that there might be something similar to the JNF that can help?  

Some motivation:
For $f \in F_2[x]$ and $F_4 = F_2[\mu]/(\mu^2 + \mu + 1)$, the map is $Df = f(x + \mu) - f(x)$ (so actually $D: F_2[x] \to F_4[x]$, but clearly this can be thought of as an endomorphism).  I'm trying to find the kernel of this map in $F_2$.  Originally, I thought it would be spanned by elements like $x^{2^n} + x^{2^{n-2}}$, since $(x + \mu)^n$ would have a lot of non-zero terms when n isn't a power of 2.  But after trying to prove that, I found several counterexamples (exempli gratia $x^{12} + x^9 + x^6 + x^3$).  Additionally, if $\text{deg}f=n$, I have $n$ equations that the coefficients of $f$ must satisify for $f$ to be in the kernel, and I believe I can show that we can have polynomials of 8, 16, 32, et cetera, terms that aren't sums of something that has fewer terms and already is in the kernel, but that's quite a bit of work!  So I've decided to try looking for a different basis for $F_2[x]$ that would get close to diagonalizing the matrix of $D$. But as @Mariano, pointed out, this may not be any easier...

Edit before I provided and motivation, this question asked about idempotent maps and not nilpotent. But that was because I was being silly and got the terms ""idempotent"" and ""nilpotent"" confused.  I didn't catch my mistake until @Mariano reminded me that an idempotent operator is a projection when he answered the idempotent question.  The map $D$ is clearly not idempotent!

3747,3747,5969,URLs with final slash trigger hotlink protection on my server,"in all my Apache servers I use hotlink protection because I hate the idea someone could stick my images/flash in their sites using my server bandwidth.

In order to make hotlink protection work, in my Apache .htaccess I simply use this:

#Hotlink protection (only for www.domain.it cause http://domain.it is being redirected)
RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} !^http://www.domain.it/.*$      [NC]
RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} !^http://www.domain.it$      [NC]
RewriteRule .*\.(wav|swf|jpg|jpeg|gif|png|bmp|js)$ - [F,NC]


This works well, but I recently dicovered that when I ask for http://www.domain.com/somepage.htm/ (with final slash) the hotlink protection seems to be triggered and server stops page to download .(wav|swf|jpg|jpeg|gif|png|bmp|js) files

Do you know how could I fix this in .htaccess???

Before today I even thought that the server should return an error if I enter as URL http://www.domain.com/somepage.htm/ (with final slash). But I saw it's normal because if you look for http://www.php.net/docs.php it returns the same page of http://www.php.net/docs.php/ (final slash).
Why is that, could you explain me a bit?!

Thanks
",Marco Demaio,https://serverfault.com/users/34721,"Are you sure it's the hotlink protection?  If your website is laid out something like this:

/somepage.htm

Then if somepage.htm has relative paths to the image like &lt;img src=""images/a.jpg""&gt; and you go to http://example.com/somepage.htm/, then your web browser will think it's in the ""somepage.htm"" directory and try to load the image http://example.com/somepage.htm/images/a.jpg.

Putting a submit button at the bottom of the form will get the data to post and bind to Product if you change the top of the form to 

@using (Html.BeginForm(""AddToCart"", ""WHATEVERYOURCONTROLLERISCALLED""))


but I think you are missing a few key points here.

There are some conventions that you seem to be ignoring

ShoppingCart.cs should be named ShoppingCartController.cs and appear in the controllers folder of your project

Instead of naming each price on the model you can use a list of prices options and display them on the form as a series of radio buttons while putting the mutually exclusive choice. for example.

The Model

public class Product{

// remove all the different price properties. 

// other properties go here...And while you are at it Use Pascal case for property names Eg. displaySize would be DisplaySize but I guess that is up to you.

[Required]
public string PriceChoice { get; set; }

}


The Controller

public class ShoppingCartController : Controller
{

public ActionResult Details(int productId)
{
   // get the product from the database
    var model = Database.GetProductById(productId);

   // set a default if you want
   model.PriceChoice = ""a"";

    return View(model);
}

[HttpPost]
public ActionResult AddToCart(Product model)

@Html.ValidationMessageFor(x =&gt; x.PriceChoice )
&lt;input type=""submit"" value=""OK"" /&gt;
}


Now that's all very abridged and basic so I hope you get the gist of it.

Also you'll find some value in reading this Post Redirect Get So while it doesn't strictly apply to what you are doing it will explain the structure of the code you are reading in the examples where you see RedirectToAction.

Now if you want to do this really cleverly you will have to learn some javascript and issue an Ajax command.

It only lasts for a fraction of a second, doesn't continue once the engine is running, and doesn't happen if I shut the engine off and start it again a few minutes later.

A little background:

The car has 92,000 miles on it.  I've noticed that it burns oil pretty quickly, so I keep an eye on it and make sure to add more if needed.  Most recently, I got an oil change with a high mileage synthetic, but that has not solved the issue.

Does anyone know what this could be?  Is it a big deal?  I'm obviously worried about damaging the engine.  Is this a major thing?  Or is it something I can live with, provided I don't mind the frightening noise that occurs on startup.

  How to implement a white-list-based system in Gmail?  




I only want to accept email from two addresses, the rest I want to delete immediately, unseen.

I know how to make filters and I can white-list those two addresses. 

If I make 3 filter, in this order;

1) from a@a.com move to inbox, never mark as spam
2) from b@b.com move to inbox, never mark as spam
3) from *@*.* delete immediately, never move to trash

can I be guaranteed that that will do what I want?

For instance, can I be sure that the filters are executed in that order? I don't want to lose any mail from those two addresses.



[Update] The accepted answer was almost correct, but instead of doesn't have &lt;list of email addresses&gt; (which did not work) I used from ~{&lt;list of email addresses&gt;}

The tilde ~ negates and the curly braces {} delimit the list. So, mail from anyone who is not in the approved list will be filtered.

You can try setting up a filter that only looks for emails that are NOT from the intended recipients. In the case you list int he question, you would set up your filter like this:

Doesn't have: a@a.com, b@b.com (Delete it)


This means that the filter selects everything unless it either comes from these addresses, or contains these addresses somewhere in the email thread.

3988,3988,6366,"If $f : [-a,a] \rightarrow \mathbb{IR}$ is Scott continuous, why are $f^-$ and $f^+$ measurable?","In ""A domain theoretic account of Picard's theorem"" (http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~dirk/Publications/icalp2004.pdf), the authors assert the following.

Let $\mathbb{IR}$ be the interval domain $\lbrace [a^-,a⁺] | a^- \leq a^+, a^-, a^+ \in \mathbb{R} \rbrace \cup \lbrace \mathbb{R} \rbrace$.

Suppose $f = [f^-,f^+] : [-a,a] \rightarrow \mathbb{IR}$ is Scott continuous. Then $f^-$ and $f^+$ are measurable.

Their proof consists in asserting that $f⁻$ and $f⁺$ are lower (resp. upper) semi-continuous, which I have tried without success to establish. Can anyone help with either an explanation or a reference that proves it?
",user3078439,https://mathoverflow.net/users/44691,"This answers @user3078439's question in his comment to my original answer.

First, a short argument to show that if $P,Q$ are domains and $f:P\to Q$ is Scott-continuous, then $f$ is order preserving.

Let $a\leq b \in P$. So $D:= \{a,b\}$ is a directed set with $b=\bigsqcup D$. Since $f$ is Scott-continuous, $f(D) = \{f(a), f(b)\}$ is also directed, so at least one of the relations $f(a) \leq f(b)$ or $f(b) \leq f(a)$ holds in $Q$. Now $f$ being Scott-continuous means $$f(b) = f(\bigsqcup D) = \bigsqcup f(D) = \sup\{f(a), f(b)\},$$ which directly implies $f(a)\leq f(b)$. So if $f:P\to Q$ is Scott-continuous, then it is order-preserving. (The converse of this statement does not hold.)

Since in your question the ordering on $Q:= \mathbb{IR}$ is given by $\supseteq$, I hope that I have answered your implicit question ""if $f$ being Scott-continuous truly means that for all $x\leq y, f(x)\supseteq f(y)$"" in the positive.

As to the question whether $f(-a)\supseteq f([-a,a])$ there is a negative answer: $f(-a)$ is just a real interval, namely $[f^-(-a), f^+(-a)]$. But $f([-a,a])$ is a set of intervals.

What is true, though, is that $f(-a)=[f^-(-a), f^+(-a)]$ is an interval that is a superset of every interval $f(x)=[f^-(x), f^+(x)]$ for all $x\in[-a,a]$. If that was the intent of your question in the comment, then there is a positive answer.

PDF), the author asserts as follows.","This answers @user3078439's question in his comment to my original answer.

First, a short argument to show that if $P,Q$ are domains and $f:P\to Q$ is Scott-continuous, then $f$ is order preserving.

Let $a\leq b \in P$. So $D:= \{a,b\}$ is a directed set with $b=\bigsqcup D$. Since $f$ is Scott-continuous, $f(D) = \{f(a), f(b)\}$ is also directed, so at least one of the relations $f(a) \leq f(b)$ or $f(b) \leq f(a)$ holds in $Q$. Now $f$ being Scott-continuous means $$f(b) = f(\bigsqcup D) = \bigsqcup f(D) = \sup\{f(a), f(b)\},$$ which directly implies $f(a)\leq f(b)$. So if $f:P\to Q$ is Scott-continuous, then it is order-preserving. (The converse of this statement does not hold.)

Since in your question the ordering on $Q:= \mathbb{IR}$ is given by $\supseteq$, I hope that I have answered your implicit question ""if $f$ being Scott-continuous truly means that for all $x\leq y, f(x)\supseteq f(y)$"" in the positive.

As to the question whether $f(-a)\supseteq f([-a,a])$ there is a negative answer: $f(-a)$ is just a real interval, namely $[f^-(-a), f^+(-a)]$. But $f([-a,a])$ is a set of intervals.

I have talked to several senior mathematicians including my advisor, but they all seem to have different opinions. I just want to hear some more opinions on the following:


How important is prestige? Suppose that I have an offer from school X, which is fairly prestigious (something like top 10, which isn't a well-defined notion). Also suppose that I have an offer from school Y, which is not as prestigious but a better match research-wise. Suppose that the ranking of school Y is approximately n (again, not a well-defined notion). For which values of n should I choose school X over school Y? My goal is to become a tenure-track professor in a PhD-granting institution.

",hithere,https://academia.stackexchange.com/users/10447,"nagniemerg is absolutely right that at the end of the day, your results will be much more important than a name on your CV.  I think being at a prestigious institution is very useful for getting a first look at your application (which is a f***ing valuable thing, as Rod Blagojevich would say); if the rest of what's there doesn't stand up, getting that look won't help much.  

That said, I would think carefully about how sure you are that institution Y really will provide a better research environment.  Prestige tends to correlate (far from perfectly) with having an active department with a lot of seminars and visitors, which can often be more valuable than day-to-day contact with a single advisor.  Having higher-quality students and colleagues can make you a better researcher.

I also think there's a lot to be said for the uncertainty of life.  Maybe you'll go somewhere and whoever you were going to work with will get a job somewhere else, or have a baby, or go on sabbatical.  Maybe you'll start a collaboration with someone you don't even know exists yet.  It's all very hard to predict, and on some level you have to go with your gut.

About the sight, I think our eyes use the parallax. But is this enough? Is this the only way we can perceive distances with them?

About the sounds, I think it is merely by interferometry, but I am not convinced, because the distances between our ears and the wavelength are not always comparable to one another.

What do you think about it?

You can only work your way around this abstraction, by determining which areas of the visible workspace correspond to which monitor and then place windows at the correct offset.

Sensible toolkits support a -geometry option, which allows your application to request being placed at a specific position. If you don't have this option available, you can use wmctrl if you have an EWMH/NetWM compatible X Window Manager to move and resize already existing windows (see wmctrl (1), you need options -r and -e). I use devilspie to force placement of some windows and of course your window manager of choice may have its own facility to force window placement.

devilspie allows to apply certain actions on X windows and can use X window properties to discern different windows and applications. The key rule for you would be geometry ""&lt;width&gt;x&lt;height&gt;+&lt;xoffset&gt;+&lt;yoffset&gt;"".

Yet, you always need to do the calculations of when and where another physical monitor begins yourself. But this is not too hard and xrandr does tell you how and where it uses monitors in the form of ""&lt;width&gt;x&lt;height&gt;+&lt;xoffset&gt;+&lt;yoffset&gt; on each line staring with an output name.

There is not the foolproof-it-will-just-work way, because implementations may (and do!) vary. wmctrl usually works on the window title to identify the target. devilspie can also refer to its class, yet, I am not aware of any toolkit that lets you specify a X windows class but not its geometry.

Of course you could always start two xephyr instances and make one fill your left screen and the other your right screen and then address screens via the DISPLAY environment variable, but this solution has other downsides.

In theory, the authority to govern window placement is the window manager. Consequently, if you want stuff your window manager can't to, it will be hacky and it's also the reason why there is no generic way to accomplish this.

3220,3220,5138,How can I get a UIWebView's UIScrollView delegate methods called from within a standard UIViewController?,"So I just have a standard UIViewController with a UIWebView in it that displays a pdf. For the app functionality, I have need to be able to respond to the UIWebView's nested UIScrollView events like scrollViewWillBeginDragging, scrollViewDidScroll, etc. 

The only way I can get access to the scrollView is to (it seems like a hack) go in and get it by the subviews array:

for (id subview in webView.subviews){
    if ([[subview class] isSubclassOfClass: [UIScrollView class]])  {
        UIScrollView * s = (UIScrollView*)subview;
        s.delegate = self;
        s.tag = 1;
        scrollView = s;
    }
}


But that seems to introduce more problems than it's worth, because I lose native UIScrollView stuff like zooming.

So to sum up what I'm needing:

What is the best way to set my UIViewController class as the delegate of the UIScrollView inside of the UIWebView? Is there something I need to do with subclassing my own UIWebView so that it handles events from it's built in UIWebView a certain way and then pass it along somehow to the UIViewController? How does that passing thing work anyway?

Please advise!

Thank you!

Have you checked there is only one UIScrollView subclass in the subviews? Bung in a log in your loop to see. If there is more than one, then you'll only pick up the last one using your code.
If there is just one UIScrollView subclass, you could try saving a reference to its delegate and then in your own delegate methods passing messages on after you have done your business.


So, in your loop, something like

originalDelegate = s.delegate


And then for the delegate methods, something like:

- (void) scrollViewDidScroll: (UIScrollView*) scrollView;
{
     // do your stuff

     [originalDelegate scrollViewDidScroll: scrollView];
}


You might need to check whether originalDelegate responds to the selector before calling it, i.e. if ([originalDelegate respondsToSelector: @selector(scrollViewDidScroll:)) etc. If it were me, I'd start by implementing all twelve delegate methods defined in the UIScrollView delegate protocol.

Not tested this, so will be interested to know if it can be made to work. Do note, the docs explicitly say that UIWebView ""should not be subclassed""

It is just like a winapi function return success value? Zero = true and non-zero = false, or what is?

5784,5784,9166,Why choose an 80-200mm over an 18-200mm lens?,"Being a beginner, I can't see why I must choose an 80-200 over an 18-200. Are there scenarios where an 80-200 would be preferable over an 18-200?

I will be buying a D7000 soon and am looking at these:


AF Zoom-NIKKOR 80-200mm f/2.8D ED
AF-S DX NIKKOR 18-200mm f/3.5-5.6G ED VR II


but similar considerations would apply to other brands as well.
",Ygam,https://photo.stackexchange.com/users/2362,"The biggest reason for difference in the two lenses is aperture. The 80-200mm is a constant f/2.8 throughout the focal range and the 18-200mm varies from f/3.5 to f/5.6, so substantially slower, especially at the far end. All this really means is that the 80-200 can let in more light at the same focal length over the other. 

Also, generally, zooms with constant apertures are higher grade lenses. I hesitate to make this statement a truism, but it pretty much is. Consumer grade lenses are often massive zoom ranges with variable aperture whereas more professional grade variants are smaller zoom ranges and constant apertures. The professional variants tend to be fast, sharper, and better built. There are exceptions, but this is generally the case regardless of brand.

So, that is why you might make the choice of the 80-200mm lens. I made such a choice with a Pentax variant not so long ago...

Edit

To answer your other question, I would probably recommend the super zoom (18-200) for a newcomer if you want a single, general purpose, lens. I would expect the 80-200 to be optically superior, but also more expensive, and it would probably mean a second, equally expensive, lens to fill in the range.

I tried replacing it with a fresh one, but no luck.  There is electricity flowing to the socket, but the socket appears to have gone bad.

And how the socket is fastened: 



SOLVED: See Dan's answer below. I don't know how I missed it, but inside the socket there are screws.  The socket is not riveted to the enclosure.

This is because join() is going to block execution of the current thread and wait until the newly created thread returns before allowing the current thread to continue.

You can call detach() which will allow the thread to continue and the data will be written.

As far as what is the best way to write the data of the vector it depends on what size is it going to be and what behavior do you want.  You could make a copy if the vector is not that large and then write the copy to the file.

\setbeamercolor{frametitle}{&lt;color&gt;}

to change the position of the headers, you need to redefine the headline template as defined in the outer theme infolines (internally used by CambridgeUS). Here's the original definition:

2491,2491,3972,"What role is a ""Heavy"" supposed to fill?","Based on the name and my understanding of the TF2 class, a Heavy is a front-lines tanky soldier guy. But that doesn't really seem to be his role in XCOM. Assault soldiers are better at being in the front lines with their mobility and defensive abilities.

What, then, is the heavy supposed to be doing on the battlefield? What are the general strategies that are useful for heavy soldiers?
",StrixVaria,https://gaming.stackexchange.com/users/1719,"Hello just reading through all the above and realized that my play style is quite different from most people that have answered this question. Heavies are by far what I call as close as possible to the X-COM the original in the fight against the giant single eye @ Cydonia: You had an inventory grid and I would just cram the soldier with heavy plasma on 1 hand with extra clips, psi amp on the other hand, blaster launcher in back pack, 1st blaster ammo in the back pack, 2nd &amp; 3rd bomb ammo in the belt, an electro flair, and the rest with as many alien grenades and proximity grenades, and the flying suit.

So to mimic the original X-COM I built my heavy with the following skills:
shredder rocket and 1 more rocket giving it a total of 3 blaster bombs.
I gave the heavy grenadier for 2 alien grenades, if only there were prox grenades.
Bullet swarm to mimic auto shot, and rapid reaction - kinda like saving time units for snap shot and just sit in the corners waiting for aliens at the base.

I debated between psi suit vs. archangel suit vs. titan vs. ghost for psi ready soldiers and after some playing around, in the end I went for ghost suit. Ghost suit is just too good as you run as far as u can without triggering the enemy to move, and on the next turn I'd have so many opening moves to choose from: bullet swarm or mind control for single enemies when they are close by, grenade if their clustered but too close to friendlies, or blaster if i can hit a lot without hurting friendlies. 

This was so good I decided to have 4 heavies like this. All 3 heavies go cloak, run in and surprise fireworks. Now the good thing about running into the enemies with ghosted heavies is that you can mind control them and before the control wears off group them up and grenade/blaster bomb em to death or even use their own grenades on em while clustered. So my heavies are the front of the line. I usually go with 4, followed by 2 medics for health patch up. In the end game, it was mandatory to have one of my heavy's go with psi suit as a volunteer, but now I know it's not needed to have the highest will power soldier to finish the game. Although that heavy was kinda fun with 3 blaster bombs and rift. I'd take ghost armor any time. 4 ghosting blaster heavies is a total of 12 blaster bombs per mission, so blasting fun (just remember by late game you have everything you want and you don't need to worry about the loot).

I am NOT an XML guy so I have no clue how to tell you to extract that information dynamically. (More on this below.)

I can't see any way to determine whether isolation has been set (at the batch level or using things like WITH (NOLOCK)) - you might have to:


capture those in the act by polling sys.dm_exec_requests (though transaction_isolation_level really only tells you about things like SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL, not table-level hints, since you can apply NOLOCK only to some tables in the query), or
rely on parsing of the query text itself from sys.dm_exec_sql_text (noting that this can yield false positives if, say, NOLOCK is commented out, or you have a table name like dbo.SubmitNoLocks). 


I also can't see any difference in the plan for query hints like OPTION (FORCE ORDER) or OPTION (FAST n), so likewise these may also need to rely on parsing the query text as opposed to relying on the plan XML.

EDIT

Since you can get a non-XML version of the plan from an alternate DMF, sys.dm_exec_text_query_plan, you don't necessarily have to become an XML guru to perform this parsing. For example, the following will capture all query plans in the cache that used WITH (INDEX...), WITH FORCESEEK[(...)], WITH FORCESCAN, WITH (NOEXPAND) or WITH (NOLOCK):

SELECT t.[text]--, qp.query_plan 
FROM sys.dm_exec_cached_plans AS p
CROSS APPLY sys.dm_exec_sql_text(p.plan_handle) AS t
CROSS APPLY sys.dm_exec_text_query_plan(p.plan_handle, 0, -1) AS qp
WHERE 
 t.[text] NOT LIKE '%dm_exec%' -- to keep this query out of result
 AND
 (
  qp.query_plan LIKE '%ForceSeek=""1""%'
  OR qp.query_plan LIKE '%Forcescan=""1""%'
  OR qp.query_plan LIKE '%NoExpandHint=""1""%'
  OR qp.query_plan LIKE '%ForcedIndex=""1""%'
  OR t.[text] LIKE '%NOLOCK%'
 )
 -- t.[dbid] = DB_ID() -- to limit results, but may be too exclusionary
;


As identified earlier, this could produce false positives for queries like this:

SELECT * FROM dbo.table /* WITH (NOLOCK) */
SELECT * FROM dbo.RenoLocksmiths;


But outside of parsing the query text for NOLOCK, for all the plan attributes - since the XML gets entitized and characters like quotes get escaped - it will not return false positives for queries like this:

SELECT * FROM dbo.table /* Forceseek=""1"" */
SELECT * FROM dbo.[WITH (FORCESEEK)];

5934,5934,9403,When can an article be omitted?,"I am aware that articles are the modifiers, which introduce a noun/noun_phrase in a sentence, and by the rules of English grammar we should use an article before referring to a noun in a sentence.

However, I see that the above rule is not strictly followed. I have seen sentences where though a noun/noun_phrase is used in a sentence but an introductory article is not used.

Eg : Login to desktop and start the paint application [ Desktop is a noun, hence I expect either ""Login to a desktop and ...."" or ""Login to the desktop at the corner and .....""]

So please help me understand, when can an article be omitted ?
Thanks in advance.
",Flair,https://ell.stackexchange.com/users/8260,"There are various special cases, but in general: You need an article in English whenever you have a singular noun that is not a proper name. You do not use an article with a proper name. Articles are optional with plurals -- not in the sense that you can include them or not on a whim, but that they change the meaning. You should also not use an article when you use a possessive, like ""my"", or the adjective ""one"". (I'm sure I've seen other adjectives that take the place of an article, but I can't think of any right now.)

Maybe that's not entirely clear, so here are some examples:

""You can start the application."" ""Application"" is singular, so an article is required.

""You can start applications."" ""Applications"" is plural, so you don't need an article.

""You can start Microsoft Word."" ""Microsoft Word"" is a proper noun, the name of one particular application, so no article is used.

""You can start one application."" ""One"" takes the place of an article.

""You  can start his application."" ""His"" is a possessive that makes an article unneeded.

If you use ""the"" before a plural, it indicates that you are talking about some particular set. Like if you said, ""You can start applications"", that would mean any applications, but if you said, ""You  can start the applications"", that would indicate that you are talking about some specific set of applications, not any applications in the world.

In your example, I would have written ""You can log in to THE desktop"". ""Desktop"" is not a proper noun and so requires an article. Or perhaps in this case the writer is referring to some specific product called ""Desktop"" and so he is thinking of it as a proper noun. If that's the case, it should be capitalized.

I wanted to do more checks on segment_2 before deciding if I should set query param(checking if the segment is for pagination such as P1 or P4).

{exp:low_search:results

However, I don't think this will work. I think it has something to do with the parse order where you can't set complex conditionals inside a tag.

If so, is there an alternative way to set the query param?

UPDATE: The reason I am asking is because the code below does not work

{if {segment_2} == '' OR {exp:segment_search keyword=""/^P\d+$/"" segments=""2"" regex=""yes""}}

",arvinsim,https://expressionengine.stackexchange.com/users/636,"So yeah. Parse order. I take it you've seen this pdf. If not, take a look, study it well.

What you need is for the opening tag to be in order before you hit stage 5: the parsing of module/plugin tags. In order to do that, you can only use simple conditionals in combination with early parsed global variables and preload replace variables. Native early parsed vars are limited, so go and get the super useful (and free) Mo' Variables to get more useful early parsed stuff.

Once installed, you can use {if paginated}{/if} as a simple conditional. Just beware you don't use any AND or OR operators, nor use {if:else} in your conditionals, because that will turn it into an advanced one, and will be parsed too late for your use.

First of all, this: {if {segment_2} == ''} is an advanced conditional. The simple syntax is {if segment_2 == ''}. Using tags in conditionals, like you do with the {exp:segment_search} tag, means the conditional is advanced, too. So, avoid.

Here's my take, using preload replace vars and simple conditionals only.

{!-- Don't set the query param if there is no query --}

    // test points with 
    // if (arr[i].*member &lt; arr[j].*member) {/* i sorts before j */}
}

quicksort(arr, &amp;point::x, 0, n-1);


More generically, you could follow the example of std::sort and accept any comparison functor:

template &lt;typename RandIter, typename Compare&gt;
void quicksort(RandIter begin, RandIter end, Compare compare) {
    // test points with 
    // if (compare(*it1, *it2)) {/* *it1 sorts before *it2 */}
}

quicksort(arr, arr+n, 
    [](point const &amp;lhs, point const &amp;rhs) {return lhs.x &lt; rhs.x;});


And of course, unless you're learning how to implement a sorting algorithm, just use std::sort.

5097,5097,8105,how to resolve LM358's huge error as a current sense differential amplifier,"Ive built a current sense differential amplifier that measures the voltage across a 1 Ohm resistor to give me a reading for the current through it.

Ive connected it as follows, all resistors are matched 10K to give a gain of 1:



I am powering it from a single rail 12 volt source. The problem is even though this is a rail to rail opamp (Output Low swing from 5-20mv) im getting a constant error of 0.62v and it seems the opamp is not able to go below this value. 

I have tired to resolve this by connected Vout to ground using a 10K resistor but that makes no difference what so ever.

I tried it with dual supply configuration (+8v,-8v) and that seems to resolve the issue. But i want to run this off a single supply rail so this is not a viable option.

How can i resolve this? Im trying to measure the voltage drop across a 1ohm resistor to give me a reading for current through the circuit (0-1v represents 0-1 Amp) so i can set up a current limit. A better way (or practice) to doing this is also welcomed.The initial (but not ideal) fix i can think of is to offset the readings by a few volts?

Edit:

Changed R1-R4 from 10K to 100K and im down to about 30-50mv!

842,842,1340,Are mutliple database calls really significant with a network call for a web API?,"At one of my employers, we worked on a REST (but it also applies to SOAP) API. The client, which is the application UI, would make calls over the web (LAN in typical production deployments) to the API. The API would make calls to the database.

One theme that recurs in our discussions is performance: some people on the team believe that you should not have multiple database calls (usually reads) from a single API call because of performance; you should optimize them so that each API call has only (exactly) one database call.

But is that really important? Consider that the UI has to make a network call to the API; that's pretty big (order of magnitude of milliseconds). Databases are optimized to keep things in memory and execute reads very, very quickly (eg. SQL Server loads and keeps everything in RAM and consumes almost all your free RAM if it can).

TLDR: Is it really significant to worry about multiple database calls when we are already making a network call over the LAN? If so, why?

To be clear, I'm talking about order of magnitude -- I know that it depends on specifics (machine hardware, choice of API and DB, etc.) If I have a call that takes O(milliseconds), does optimizing for DB calls that take an order of magnitude less, actually matter? Or is there more to the problem than this?

Edit: for posterity, I think it's quite ridiculous to make claims that we need to improve performance by combining database calls under these circumstances -- especially with a lack of profiling. However, it's not my decision whether we do this or not; I want to know what the rationale is behind thinking this is a correct way of optimizing web API calls.

2965,2965,4719,Does a terminator have a form of self-preservation or prohibition against suicide?,"This weekend I was watching Terminator 2 (editor cut). In the end, after T-1000 is destroyed, Arnold asks Sarah and John to destroy him by melting and says ""I cannot destroy myself"".

So, what does this mean? The terminator cannot destroy himself unless it is absolutely necessary in order to succeed in his mission (like protect John?)?

In that case, what was the Terminator in part 1 going to do after the success of his mission (i.e. destroy Sarah)? Just live a long happy life and wait for Skynet arise?

Update:
I understand that this is not the exact Third law of Asimov, since the terminators definitely don't follow the First or Second law. Let's call it the law of self-preservation. Does terminator have a form of self-preservation to some point and the prohibition of suicide?

First, /dev/sda is NOT recognized correctly! This disk is 500GB.

Third, trying to format the disk, it really sees only the sectors until 320GB:
When I start fdisk I am warned:

Command (m for help): w
The partition table has been altered!

I have other USB hard drives with 320GB and they really mount fine. 


Is this a limitation of RPi? Or a problem with this specific Hard Drive?   
How can I use this large disk with my RPi? 


update: solved the issue with help of the commentators here...

here is what I did ...


I thought I have some weired issue with Debian Wheezy &amp; gparted. So, I reformatted the hard drive to NTFS. Before that I ERASED the partition table. 
And created a new single NTFS partition. 
Bingo! RPi, identified the partition. However, it claimed my Drive is now 2TB big, and recommended I will use GPT:

whoops! That is WRONG!

So, I disconnected the hard drive again. re-connented it to my laptop. I erased the partition table again, and re-created the partition table using fdisk on RPi! not on my laptop! This time, I took a short cut, and created the disk partition with ext4 directly. 
    I plugged the hard-drive to RPi and BINGO!

conclusion (?)

My guess is that gparted in Debian Wheezy includes some nasty bug which is sometimes showing it's ugly face. I would report a bug if I had more solid evidence. But ... since I have only one 500GB hard drive, and I don't want to
risk the health of this hard drive reformatting it so many time, I will settle this with it. If you happen to bump into this post, and you have had similar problems with large SATA drives and partitioning on wheezy, I would be happy to know.
",Oz123,https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/users/3505,"The comments on the original post are getting too long, so here is my answer.
I suspect that it's the drive itself. Maybe try update your Raspberry Pi and then try again.

Then try to access the drive. If this does still not work. I'd recommend trying to find someone with a HDD at least the same size or bigger and test that.

I created 2 partitions (180GB and 320GB).
RPi would only recognize the first partition. 

So, I tried creating the partitions using the raspberrypi. Here are my surprising findings:

First, /dev/sda is NOT recognized correctly! This disk is 500GB. 

Second, mounting /dev/sda2 is not possible:

root@raspberrypi:/home/ozn# mount -t ext4 /dev/sda2 /media/usbhdd1/
mount: special device /dev/sda2 does not exist
# although fdisk -l showed this device !


Third, trying to format the disk, it really sees only the sectors until 320GB:
When I start fdisk I am warned:

Building a new DOS disklabel with disk identifier 0x6784fc4b.
Changes will remain in memory only, until you decide to write them.
After that, of course, the previous content won't be recoverable.

Warning: invalid flag 0x0000 of partition table 4 will be corrected by w(rite)

Command (m for help): w
The partition table has been altered!

Calling ioctl() to re-read partition table.
Syncing disks.


I have other USB hard drives with 320GB and they really mount fine. 


Is this a limitation of RPi? Or a problem with this specific Hard Drive?   
How can I use this large disk with my RPi? 


update: solved the issue with help of the commentators here...

here is what I did ...


I thought I have some weired issue with Debian Wheezy &amp; gparted. So, I reformatted the hard drive to NTFS. Before that I ERASED the partition table. 
And created a new single NTFS partition. 
Bingo! RPi, identified the partition. However, it claimed my Drive is now 2TB big, and recommended I will use GPT:

root@raspberrypi:/home/ozn# fdisk -l /dev/sda

Disk /dev/sda: 2199.0 GB, 2199023255552 bytes

whoops! That is WRONG!

So, I disconnected the hard drive again. re-connented it to my laptop. I erased the partition table again, and re-created the partition table using fdisk on RPi! not on my laptop! This time, I took a short cut, and created the disk partition with ext4 directly. 
    I plugged the hard-drive to RPi and BINGO!

I recently took up Mobile Automation task and hence am completely new  to Appium. I am working with Appium 1.2.0.1 on Windows 7 and trying to automate the native Android Browser(not Chrome or an App) on an Android v4.3 real device. 
I have installed everything according to the instructions. I am using Selenium in Maven Build in JUnit Framework to execute the scripts through Appium. I use Appuim.exe in Admin mode and use the GUI to start the node. Then I run my scripts. 

My issue is that when I try ""adb devices"" in cmd, I am able to see the device. Whereas, during execution, Appium is throwing an Error ""Failed to start an Appium session, err was: Error: Could not find a connected Android device."" I tried many troubleshooting options and verified if everything is in place. No luck. Please help.

Is there any particular cause for the sudden popularity of .io domains?
",samthebrand,https://webmasters.stackexchange.com/users/13067,"
They're available…
…probably because they're significantly more expensive(from any registrar I've ever seen) than the usual TLDs…
…and somewhat desirable to techs because of a cheap I/O joke.


The usage itself among web/tech people isn't terribly new. There were several bloggers who started using the TLD years ago that I can't remember at the moment. Over time, it just seems to have slowly built an association with those sorts of people and their output/products. You have to remember that it's gotten really hard to find a decent short domain with .com et al, and very few alternative TLDs like .ws have ever gained much traction, so there's a bit of community convergence going on here, stemming in part from that shared joke.

As far as I can google, dd-wrt shares files through SAMBA. I know it's not the prefered option for Ubuntu users and we would prefer NFS, but does anyone know how bad or good it is this setup?

NFS isn't compiled into the dd-wrt kernel so if you want to use it, you need to use the userspace version which is somewhat slower.

Routers don't tend to be the best fileservers. They have a great networking stack but the interface between the router and the drive is pretty slow. On top of that CPU overhead that wouldn't be noticed on a proper server can cause a little router quite a lot of stress.

Acquiring a building, a few volunteers, how much to run it per day, ect? Anyone have any experience in this?

EDIT:
So, it was suggested that I make an eco orphanage in a forest. I accidently doomed the continent with demons, so that won't work. (Wish spell to get rid of orcs, things went horribly wrong) NO one knows it was me though! :D

",samuraiseoul,https://rpg.stackexchange.com/users/10381,"There isn't anything in the core rules about building ownership, but you (or your DM) can fake it in a good-enough way (at least, so long as nobody tries to break the game using such a ruling) by estimating off the equipment tables. You need three things: cost for building maintenance (or rent), cost for food, and (if not renting) initial price of the building.

In the equipment chapter under Food, Drink, And Lodging, a poor meal costs 1sp. I'm picking ""poor"" because no matter how much you have, you want to stretch it as far as you can to feed as many, right? So go with ""poor"". That price is assuming making a profit, so let's be conservative (on the ""more expensive for you"" side) and cut it in half: 5cp to feed an orphan. Maybe shave that down to 3cp, since they're kids and not grown adults eating at a poor inn. (This is really back-of-the-envelope stuff, not rigorous at all.)

We can do something similar for the rent/maintenance of the building: a night's stay in a poor inn is listed as 2sp. Let's cut it in half to 1sp to eliminate the profit normally involved. Since a normal poor inn can maintain the whole building on 2sp per room per night, we can be pretty sure that the 1sp per orphan per night will cover (sans profits) whatever costs are involved in paying rent or taxes, repairs, replacing bedding, laundering, upkeep of the non-sleeping quarters and so on.

Somewhere, between the price for meals and the price for rooms, a combined inn/tavern also pays for their kitchen, so we're probably safely in the black with our estimates. You probably don't need to maintain a stable like a normal inn, and you're not paying for the volunteer labour, so that makes the estimate even more likely to at least meet or exceed the costs of rooms and food.

Altogether, that makes it 1sp, 3cp to feed and house a single orphan per day, assuming one good meal every day (which is not far off the unfortunate reality of old orphanages). If you want to have them slightly healthier, but be able to take in fewer, make it two meals per day and double the meals costs to 6cp, for 1.6sp per orphan per day.

So, very roughly, you see how you can use the goods and services lists in the core book to get a gameable estimate of the costs per orphan per day. From there you can look at what money you've got stashed and what your incoming donations are, and estimate how many orphans you can house and feed at once on an ongoing basis.

As for the initial cost of acquiring the building, that the core rules don't provide anything even close to helpful for estimating. You don't have to worry about this if you find a willing landlord, but if you have to buy the building outright, this becomes a slightly sticky issue. If I was running this game I'd probably just play it out, maybe angling for the druid to find a donor with a vacant building.

What should I do? Buy a building, several volunteers, how much per day, and so on? Does anyone have any experience in this field? My character is a woodrui, who has never been to a city, seeing people's poverty and lack of food and housing. He wants to help! But I don't know how to build an ongoing helping behavior. It's easy to find out at one time when buying food for the town. How many people need how much food is the price. But who knows about the larger ongoing philanthropy?","There isn't anything in the core rules about building ownership, but you (or your DM) can fake it in a good-enough way (at least, so long as nobody tries to break the game using such a ruling) by estimating off the equipment tables. You need three things: cost for building maintenance (or rent), cost for food, and (if not renting) initial price of the building.

In the equipment chapter under Food, Drink, And Lodging, a poor meal costs 1sp. I'm picking ""poor"" because no matter how much you have, you want to stretch it as far as you can to feed as many, right? So go with ""poor"". That price is assuming making a profit, so let's be conservative (on the ""more expensive for you"" side) and cut it in half: 5cp to feed an orphan. Maybe shave that down to 3cp, since they're kids and not grown adults eating at a poor inn. (This is really back-of-the-envelope stuff, not rigorous at all.)

We can do something similar for the rent/maintenance of the building: a night's stay in a poor inn is listed as 2sp. Let's cut it in half to 1sp to eliminate the profit normally involved. Since a normal poor inn can maintain the whole building on 2sp per room per night, we can be pretty sure that the 1sp per orphan per night will cover (sans profits) whatever costs are involved in paying rent or taxes, repairs, replacing bedding, laundering, upkeep of the non-sleeping quarters and so on.

Somewhere, between the price for meals and the price for rooms, a combined inn/tavern also pays for their kitchen, so we're probably safely in the black with our estimates. You probably don't need to maintain a stable like a normal inn, and you're not paying for the volunteer labour, so that makes the estimate even more likely to at least meet or exceed the costs of rooms and food.

Altogether, that makes it 1sp, 3cp to feed and house a single orphan per day, assuming one good meal every day (which is not far off the unfortunate reality of old orphanages). If you want to have them slightly healthier, but be able to take in fewer, make it two meals per day and double the meals costs to 6cp, for 1.6sp per orphan per day.

So, very roughly, you see how you can use the goods and services lists in the core book to get a gameable estimate of the costs per orphan per day. From there you can look at what money you've got stashed and what your incoming donations are, and estimate how many orphans you can house and feed at once on an ongoing basis.

As for the initial cost of acquiring the building, that the core rules don't provide anything even close to helpful for estimating. You don't have to worry about this if you find a willing landlord, but if you have to buy the building outright, this becomes a slightly sticky issue. If I was running this game I'd probably just play it out, maybe angling for the druid to find a donor with a vacant building. At worst I'd just name a price in gold and get on with it, while making sure that the players know that the price is particular to this building from this seller, and they shouldn't expect it to set a precedent. Maybe, like 100gp or something.

Yes, but you will need a convincing argument for why graduate school will go better next time than it did the first time you tried it.  It's easy to say ""I didn't care about grades and didn't work very hard, but I'll work harder this time,"" while actually working harder is much more difficult, so vague excuses may be discounted.

You could get lucky and find a school that is happy to give you another chance (perhaps a less prestigious department, which sees potential in you beyond what's typical for their students).  You might also be able to give a more concrete excuse for your past grades (for example, if there were external factors in your life that troubled you last time but won't apply this time).  Otherwise, the best way to demonstrate that things have changed is probably to succeed at something else.  Finding a job and doing well at it can show that you are now more mature and responsible than when you were a student, and successfully taking a few classes part-time can also look good.

So I'd suggest following a two-part strategy.  Try applying again with the best explanations/excuses you can offer, and see whether it works.  If it doesn't, then you should start thinking about longer-term methods to demonstrate that you've changed.

4404,4404,6998,Bug in my C code to reverse words in a string,"I was practicing some programming problems and tried to code the popular ""reverse words in a string"" problem. 

I tried to come up with my own code in C. I am able to partially get it right. That is, ""hello world"" becomes ""world olleh"". I am wondering what the bug is here. I think somewhere I am creating an off by 1 bug. 

As much as possible, I wanted to do it without using library functions. I searched here for this problem &amp; found many solutions, but I'd like to know why my solution doesn't work.

void reverse(char*, int);

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
    char st[]= ""hello world"";
    int len = strlen(st);
    int i=0,j=0;

    reverse(st,len-1); // Reverse the entire string. hello world =&gt; dlrow olleh

    while(st[j]){ //Loop till end of the string
        if ( *(st+j) == ' ' || *(st+j) == '\0' ) { //if you hit a blank space or the end of the string
            reverse(st+i,j-1); // reverse the string starting at position i till position before the blank space i.e j-1
            i=++j; //new i &amp; j are 1 position to the right of old j
        }
        else {
            j++; //if a chacacter is found, move to next position
        }               
    }       

    printf(""%s"",st);
    return 0;
}

void reverse(char *s, int n)
{
    char *end = s+n; //end is a pointer to an address which is n addresses from the starting address

1409,1409,2218,Double weapons and switching hands,"I am playing a Warblade weilding a Spiked Chain.

I have one head of the chain enchanted with +1 Sweeping, and the other head with +2.

My question is, if I have the +2 end as my main attack, and the +1 as offhand, can I still choose to make a Trip attack with the +1 end anytime I choose?
How easy is it to switch the ends of a double weapon?
",EisenKreutzer,https://rpg.stackexchange.com/users/11719,"tl;dr: Yes, you may attack freely with either end of a double weapon, except when using Two-Weapon Fighting, where the offhand attack cannot be made with the same end as the main attack.

You may use any weapon you are wielding for any attack. You may choose which wielded weapon you use independently of the choice you made for any previous attacks; that is, you are never &ldquo;locked in&rdquo; to any particular weapon (or &ldquo;locked out&rdquo; for that matter, with one major exception explained below).

Choosing a weapon for an attack is not even a free action; it is a non-action component of the attack itself. There is not actually any point where you &ldquo;change&rdquo; which weapon you are using; each attack simply lets you choose a weapon, independently of any prior attacks you may have made.

Thus you may use a different weapon for each attack, or the same weapon over and over, or whatever. For double weapons, this means that both ends are available for any given attack. It does not matter if the previous attack was in the last round, or was an attack of opportunity just before your turn, or was a previous attack in a full-attack: the weapon you choose to use for this attack is completely independent of the weapon you chose to use for any previous attacks.

Note that choosing to use different weapons for each attack in a full-attack does not constitute using Two-Weapon Fighting. If you have multiple attacks for iteratives, haste, or whatever else, you may choose the weapon you use for each attack independently, and you take no penalty for choosing a different weapon than the last attack. You only take a penalty when you explicitly use Two-Weapon Fighting to get a bonus attack. This bonus attack is also the aforementioned big exception.

Big Exception: Two-Weapon Fighting

There is one major exception to the general case where you may use any wielded weapon: Two-Weapon Fighting (or Multiweapon Fighting). These combat options give a bonus attack, known as an offhand attack, but this offhand attack must be made with a different weapon than the main attack that it is paired with (and in the case of Multiweapon Fighting, a weapon different from any prior offhand attacks in the same set).

In other words, you are not free to choose a weapon you have already used when taking the bonus attacks offered by Two-Weapon or Multiweapon Fighting.

Double weapons explain that, as a special exception to the Two-Weapon Fighting rules, you may use the same double weapon for both attacks when using Two-Weapon Fighting, but they must be made with separate ends of the double weapon, and you take attack penalties as if you were wielding a one-handed weapon and a light weapon.

This is the only time where one end of the double weapon would not be available as an option for an attack: if you used an end as the main attack when Two-Weapon Fighting, the bonus attack must be made with the other end.

Also, note that you do not &ldquo;have&rdquo; one end as main and the other as offhand. The terms main and offhand are not used, and have no meaning, except during Two-Weapon Fighting. If you are not using Two-Weapon Fighting, it&rsquo;s just an attack, not main or offhand or anything else. Two-Weapon Fighting and the main/offhand designations apply only during the full-attack in which you use Two-Weapon Fighting; as soon as that full-attack completes, both ends become equal again (including for attacks of opportunity during that round).

""Enabled"" was displayed until the object came in contact with something, it outputted ""Collided with tag"". ""Disabled"" was never shown, proving that disabling/enabling an object takes immediate effect. It's probably just a flag that is checked when calling event methods.

This is assuming that Update methods are called after OnCollisionEnter, which they, according to the Unity documentation, are.

1139,1139,1785,Euclid's Algorithm (Greatest Common Divisor),"According to Donald Knuth in ""The Art Of Computer Programming"", the following is how to find the greatest common divisor of two positive numbers, m and n, using Euclid's Algorithm.


  
  Divide m by n and let r be the remainder.
  If r is 0, n is the answer; if r is not 0, continue to step 3.
  Set m = n and n = r. Go back to step 1.
  


Below is my implementation of this algorithm.

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int greatestCommonDivisor(int m, int n)
{
    int r;

    /* Check For Proper Input */
    if((m == 0) || (n == 0))
        return 0;
    else if((m &lt; 0) || (n &lt; 0))
        return -1;

    do
    {
        r = m % n;
        if(r == 0)
            break;
        m = n;
        n = r;
    }
    while(true);

    return n;
}

int main(void)
{
    int num1 = 600, num2 = 120;
    int gcd = greatestCommonDivisor(num1, num2); 

    printf(""The GCD of %d and %d is %d\n"", num1, num2, gcd);

    getchar();
    return 0;
}


Though it appears to work just fine, it doesn't seem to be as elegant as I'd like, especially in the do-while loop.  Also, the while(true) seems dangerous, though I'm pretty confident that r will be reduced to 0 eventually and we'll break out of the loop.

Do you have any suggestions on either making the code more elegant or robust?
",Fiddling Bits,https://codereview.stackexchange.com/users/33159,"Firstly, your implementation is (arguably) not quite correct:

 else if((m &lt; 0) || (n &lt; 0))
     return -1;


The GCD of two negative numbers is perfectly well defined. However, if you really don't want the user to pass in negative numbers, make it explicit in the function signature:

unsigned greatestCommonDivisor(unsigned m, unsigned n)


Euclid's algorithm is one of the most basic examples of where recursion shines:

unsigned greatestCommonDivisor(unsigned m, unsigned n)
{
    if(n == 0) return m;
    return greatestCommonDivisor(n, m % n);
}


We first check the base case, which is 2: If r is 0, n is the answer; if r is not 0, continue to step 3. The recursive call actually combines steps 1 and 3 here: m % n sets n to be the remainder r, and we call the function again with n = m.

As a final note, a lot of people avoid recursive functions in C/C++ because most compilers don't optimise tail-calls to use constant stack space. However, Euclid's algorithm will perform only O(log N) steps, hence it's easy to see on any computer with (reasonable) stack size, this won't cause a stack overflow for numbers whose size is constrained by int or unsigned.

886,886,1406,Are human males and females more genetically different than members of other species?,"I'm looking at this Ted talk about a Saudi Arabia woman who dared to drive a car in the last few years. This reminds me that until the last century or so, women (all over the world?) enjoyed less rights and might've been pigeonholed into roles predetermined by society. Those roles might've encouraged certain traits, and discouraged others. Those who did not conform might've been punished, like the woman in the talk above received death threats and was jailed.

This sounds to me like selective pressure, did it really exist, and did it have any effect on the genetics/traits of modern women?

This makes me interested in the question - compared to other species, are men and women more genetically different because of selective pressure put on women to conform to male-dominated world for thousands of years before 19th century?

Secondly, the degree of male-female differentiation appears to me to be much greater in species such as gorillas, lions and peacocks than it does in humans so I'm not convinced that humans would stand out on this front as a species we'd expect to have greater genetic differences.

Even so, the only genetic difference between male and female humans is the Y-chromosome. The X appears in both males and females and doesn't have exclusively female lineage so it can't acquire separate genes for male and female. The Y chromosome contains very few genes so its not capable of manifesting a major genetic gap and because there is no recombination in the Y chromosome it is not a fertile ground for new genes anyway.

So males and females have essentially the same genes. However, this isn't the whole story because how, when and whether genes are expressed is about as important as what genes are encoded anyway. It is these differences that enable big differences between the sexes not actual coding differences.

For instance, for a simple mono-component system $S=S(U,V,N)$ where $U$ is internal energy, $V$ is volume, and $N$ composition.

Taking the differential

$$\mathrm{d}S = \sum_i \left( \frac{\partial S}{\partial x_i}\right)_{j \neq i} \mathrm{d}x_i = \sum_i F_i \mathrm{d}x_i$$

The quantities $F_i \equiv ({\partial S}/{\partial x_i})_{j \neq i} $ are intensive entropic parameters and measure the change in entropy when variables change. For instance the intensive entropic parameter $(1/T)$ gives the change on entropy due to a change in the energy $U$.

Using the thermodynamic theory of fluctuations it can be shown that

$$F_i = k \left( \frac{\partial \ln P}{\partial x_i}\right)$$

",Bram Vanroy,https://wordpress.stackexchange.com/users/16574,"I don't think you need so many transients set, one for each category. You can only use one, that is enough. Transients are quite expensive to set as it requires additional db queries, so you would want to cut down on the use.

FEW NOTES


The first parameter, $taxonomy is the taxonomy to get terms and posts from. It defaults to 'category'
The second parameter is $args which is the arguments which should be passed to get_terms(). For more info, check get_terms()
The third parameter, $query_args is the arguments that should be passed to the custom query. Remember to avoid using any taxonomy related parameters. For more info, see WP_Query
If the second parameter is not set and the third parameter is set, pass an empty array to the second parameter
Modify and abuse the code as you see fit


USAGE

You can now use the function as follow in your templates

$post_list = get_term_post_list( 'category', ['exclude' =&gt; '1, 4, 9, 10, 2899'], ['posts_per_page' =&gt; 3] );
if ( $post_list !== null ) {
    echo $post_list;
}


If you do not pass anything to the second parameter but to the third, you should do the following (pass empty array)

$post_list = get_term_post_list( 'category', [], ['posts_per_page' =&gt; 3] );
if ( $post_list !== null ) {
    echo $post_list;
}


EDIT

In a rush, I totally forgot to add a function to flush the transient when a new post is published, updated, deleted or undeleted. As your code stands, the list will only be updated when the transient expires. 

To flush the transient on the above post conditions, simply use the transition_post_status hook. Add the following to your functions.php

add_action( 'transition_post_status', function ()
{
        global $wpdb;
        $wpdb-&gt;query( ""DELETE FROM $wpdb-&gt;options WHERE `option_name` LIKE ('_transient%_term_list_%')"" );
        $wpdb-&gt;query( ""DELETE FROM $wpdb-&gt;options WHERE `option_name` LIKE ('_transient_timeout%_term_list_%')"" );
});


EDIT 2

From your comment to this answer


  As you might have guessed I'd liked to use this in combination with my other question. How would I go about doing that? Should the exclusion of the terms happen in get_term_post_list()? Or should the two functions be merged somehow? (As I don't need them seperately.) 


The best way to accomplish is to merge the two functions into one. That would make the most sense. I have merged the two functions and modified the functionality with the exclude parameters. What I have done is, you can now add an array of term id's to excludse via the get_terms() exclude parameter and you can also within the same function set an array of term slugs to exclude. The results will be merged into one single exclude parameter before being passed to get_terms()

Here is the function, again I have commented it well to make it easy to follow (This goes into functions.php)

function get_term_post_list( $taxonomy = 'category', $args = [], $query_args = [], $exclude_by_slug = [] )  
{
    /*
     * Check if we have a transient set
     */
    if ( false === ( $output = get_transient( 'term_list_' . md5( $taxonomy . json_encode( $args ) . json_encode( $query_args ) ) ) ) ) {

        /*
         * Check if any array of slugs is passed and if it is a valid array
         */
        if ( is_array( $exclude_by_slug ) &amp;&amp; !empty( $exclude_by_slug ) ) {

            foreach ( $exclude_by_slug as $value ) {

                /*
                 * Use get_term_by to get the term ID and add ID's to an array
                 */
                $term_objects = get_term_by( 'slug', $value, $taxonomy );
                $term_ids[] = (int) $term_objects-&gt;term_id;

            }

        }

        /*

As far as usage, you first need to look at the parameters that you can pass


Parameter 1 - $taxonomy -> taxonomy to get terms from. Default category
Parameter 2 - $args -> The arguments that should be passed to get_terms(). Please see get_terms() for a full list of parameters that can be passed as an array. Default empty array []
Parameter 3 - $query_args -> Custom argument to be passed to WP_Query. You should not pass taxonomy related parameters here as it cause issues with the deafult build in tax_query. For a full list of valid arguments which can be passed in an array, see WP_Query. Default empty array []
Parameter 4 - $exclude_by_slug -> An array of slugs to exclude. Please note, this has to be a valid array for this to work. Strings will be ignored. Default empty array []


You can now call the function in any of your template files as

$a = get_term_post_list( 'category', ['exclude' =&gt; [1, 13, 42]], ['posts_per_page' =&gt; 3], ['term-slug-1', 'term-slug-2'] );
echo $a;


OR

$taxonomy = 'category';
$args = [
    'exclude' =&gt; [1, 13, 42]
];
$query_args = [
    'posts_per_page' =&gt; 3
];
$exclude_by_slug = [
    '0' =&gt; ['term-slug-1', 'term-slug-2']
];
$a = get_term_post_list( $taxonomy, $args, $query_args, $exclude_by_slug );
echo $a;


Final note, if you don't need to pass a specific parameter, remember to just pass an empty array like

$a = get_term_post_list( 'category', [], [], ['term-slug-1'] );
echo $a;


All the above replaces all your code in your question

FEW NOTES


The first parameter, $taxonomy is the taxonomy to get terms and posts from. It defaults to 'category'
The second parameter is $args which is the arguments which should be passed to get_terms(). For more info, check get_terms()
The third parameter, $query_args is the arguments that should be passed to the custom query. Remember to avoid using any taxonomy related parameters. For more info, see WP_Query
If the second parameter is not set and the third parameter is set, pass an empty array to the second parameter
Modify and abuse the code as you see fit


USAGE

You can now use the function as follow in your templates

$post_list = get_term_post_list( 'category', ['exclude' =&gt; '1, 4, 9, 10, 2899'], ['posts_per_page' =&gt; 3] );
if ( $post_list !== null ) {
    echo $post_list;
}


If you do not pass anything to the second parameter but to the third, you should do the following (pass empty array)

$post_list = get_term_post_list( 'category', [], ['posts_per_page' =&gt; 3] );
if ( $post_list !== null ) {
    echo $post_list;
}


EDIT

In a rush, I totally forgot to add a function to flush the transient when a new post is published, updated, deleted or undeleted. As your code stands, the list will only be updated when the transient expires. 

To flush the transient on the above post conditions, simply use the transition_post_status hook. Add the following to your functions.php

add_action( 'transition_post_status', function ()
{
        global $wpdb;
        $wpdb-&gt;query( ""DELETE FROM $wpdb-&gt;options WHERE `option_name` LIKE ('_transient%_term_list_%')"" );
        $wpdb-&gt;query( ""DELETE FROM $wpdb-&gt;options WHERE `option_name` LIKE ('_transient_timeout%_term_list_%')"" );
});


EDIT 2

From your comment to this answer


  As you might have guessed I'd liked to use this in combination with my other question. How would I go about doing that? Should the exclusion of the terms happen in get_term_post_list()? Or should the two functions be merged somehow? (As I don't need them seperately.) 


The best way to accomplish is to merge the two functions into one. That would make the most sense. I have merged the two functions and modified the functionality with the exclude parameters. What I have done is, you can now add an array of term id's to excludse via the get_terms() exclude parameter and you can also within the same function set an array of term slugs to exclude. The results will be merged into one single exclude parameter before being passed to get_terms()

Here is the function, again I have commented it well to make it easy to follow (This goes into functions.php)

function get_term_post_list( $taxonomy = 'category', $args = [], $query_args = [], $exclude_by_slug = [] )  
{
    /*
     * Check if we have a transient set
     */
    if ( false === ( $output = get_transient( 'term_list_' . md5( $taxonomy . json_encode( $args ) . json_encode( $query_args ) ) ) ) ) {

        /*
         * Check if any array of slugs is passed and if it is a valid array
         */
        if ( is_array( $exclude_by_slug ) &amp;&amp; !empty( $exclude_by_slug ) ) {

            foreach ( $exclude_by_slug as $value ) {

                /*

As far as usage, you first need to look at the parameters that you can pass


Parameter 1 - $taxonomy -> taxonomy to get terms from. Default category
Parameter 2 - $args -> The arguments that should be passed to get_terms(). Please see get_terms() for a full list of parameters that can be passed as an array. Default empty array []
Parameter 3 - $query_args -> Custom argument to be passed to WP_Query. You should not pass taxonomy related parameters here as it cause issues with the deafult build in tax_query. For a full list of valid arguments which can be passed in an array, see WP_Query. Default empty array []
Parameter 4 - $exclude_by_slug -> An array of slugs to exclude. Please note, this has to be a valid array for this to work. Strings will be ignored. Default empty array []


You can now call the function in any of your template files as

$a = get_term_post_list( 'category', ['exclude' =&gt; [1, 13, 42]], ['posts_per_page' =&gt; 3], ['term-slug-1', 'term-slug-2'] );
echo $a;


OR

$taxonomy = 'category';
$args = [
    'exclude' =&gt; [1, 13, 42]
];
$query_args = [
    'posts_per_page' =&gt; 3
];
$exclude_by_slug = [
    '0' =&gt; ['term-slug-1', 'term-slug-2']
];
$a = get_term_post_list( $taxonomy, $args, $query_args, $exclude_by_slug );
echo $a;


Final note, if you don't need to pass a specific parameter, remember to just pass an empty array like

$a = get_term_post_list( 'category', [], [], ['term-slug-1'] );
echo $a;


All the above replaces all your code in your question

",kce,https://serverfault.com/users/62491,"Anycast is not a widely accepted type of communication in IPv4, but it is present in IPv6.

Three type of communication in IPv4 are 1) Unicast, 2) Multicast 3) Broadcast.

1) IPv4 Unicast One-to-One type of communication. A network device communicates with another network device. Layer 3 address used for Unicast is IPv4 Class A, Class B, Class C addresses. Layer 2 address is a unicast MAC address.

Example: Browse a website, Download file using FTP, Connect to another device using SSH (Secure Shell) etc.

2) IPv4 Multicast One-to-many type of communication. A network device send an IPv4 data packet and it is delivered to the devices who are interested in that traffic. Layer 3 address  used for IPv4 multicast is Class D IPv4 addresses (starts from 224 to 239) Layer 2 address for IPv4 multicast starts with ""01:00:5e"".

Example: IPTV, OSPF Hello messages, EIGRP Hello messages, RIPv2 Route Updates.

3) IPv4 Broadcast One-to-All type of communication. A network device send an IPv4 data packet and it will be delivered all devices in that LAN Segment. Problem with broadcast traffic is, broadcasts disturb all devices in LAN and cause bandwidth wastage.

Example: DHCPv4 Discover messages

In IPv6, we have Unicast, Multicast and Anycast. The concept of Unicast and Multicast are same in IPv4 and IPv6, except the changes in IPv6 Layer 3 addresses used for broadcast &amp; multicast and the Layer 2 address used for multicast. Layer 2 address used for IPv6 multicast traffic starts from ""33:33:"" (in Ipv4, it is ""01:00:5e""). 

IPv6 Anycast IPv6 Anycast type of communication is used to identify an interface from a group of interfaces, which provide the same service, but near to the client in routing distance (we can compare routing distance similar to geographical distance). Anycast is possible only with the help of routing protocols.

Scott Guthrie says the two will exist side by side, but I'm curious just how much of the mind share ASP.NET MVC is expected to grab.

I know this is a speculative question; I'm just interested in your subjective hunches.

  ""but I am trying to assess my future job opportunities if I invest in this skill""


If you want to increase your future job opportunities then what you rather should ask yourself is; ""What is the hysterically coolest and funnyest thing I could possibly work on today?""

Because if you think of ""what will make you valuable"" you will always end up being mediocre. If you however do what's FUN to do you will end up creating competency few others have the capacity to outperform - which always seems to be valuable in the world... ;)

Not to mention that your professional life will be so much better!

Do what's FUN and what you get the most ""kicks"" out of, then your ""value"" will increase!

4501,4501,7136,conditional probability - 2 different tests done,"Question:

A medical research team wanted to evaluate a screening method proposed for 
Alzheimer's disease. The method was evaluated on 450 patients randomly selected 
patients with Alzheimers (in 436 cases, the screening was positive). Moreover,
the method was also done on 500 patients without the disease and returned 
positive for 5 out of the 500. 7.7% of all Canadians over the age of 65 have
Alzhiemers. Find the probability that a Canadian over the age of 65 has Alzhiemers
given the test was positive.




It seems that the test returns a 96.8% chance of success given that the patient has alzhiemers and a .01% chance of success given the patient DOESN'T have alzhiemers. 

So I used bayes theorem for this one, so that I would find

  A = Alzhiemers
  Positive = Positive test result given the patient actually had alzhiemers 
  Positive2 = Positive test result given the patient doesn't have alzhiemers


$$P(A | Positive) = \frac{P(Positive|A)(A)}{P(Positive|A)(A) + P(Positive2|A)(A)}$$

$$= \frac{(.968)(.077)}{(.968)(.077) + (.01)(.077)}$$

$$= approx. .98$$

Did i do this correctly? As in was i supposed to even use bayes theorem for this problem?



ahh seems like i multiplied the probability of positive test result given the person doesn't have alzhiemers with the probability of all canadians who do have alzheimers. Thanks guys.

I want to use the google developed calendar app as my main calendar app. My phone (a Galaxy S2) came with a samsung developed calendar app (both very conveniently named ""Calendar""). At this point, I simply want to disable the samsung calendar app from displaying any sort of notifications (since the google app also displays notifications and I want to use that app).

I have been able to do this by going to settings->Notifications in the samsung app and toggling to ""Off"".

However, as soon as I restart the device, the notifications are back on their original settings. Anyone else experience this? Anyone know how to make the settings stick?

EDIT: I notice the notification settings of the google developed app (sound, default reminder time, popup) are also not sticking after reboot. Is my device broken? It seems to only be for calendar. Gmail and other apps hold their settings fine.

EDIT 2: Ok, so disabling the samsung app allows my google app calendar settings to stick after reboot. So looks like that is what I will be doing. Anyone know how I can change the vcs file association to this app now?

Yes, that's exactly right.

If a static method only refers to local variables, it is automatically thread safe. (In fact, this holds for non-static methods as well.)

Generally speaking though, I would say you should avoid static if possible. In general it makes code harder to test and to reason about due to the fact that static members are in a sense global.

If a static method only refers to local variables, it is automatically thread safe. (In fact, this holds for non-static methods as well.)

Generally speaking though, I would say you should avoid static if possible. In general it makes code harder to test and to reason about due to the fact that static members are in a sense global.

4471,4471,7094,"Multiple-prime RSA; how many primes can I use, for a 2048-bit modulus?","In standard RSA, the modulus $n=p_1 p_2$ is a product of two primes $p_1,p_2$ of the same size.  Suppose we construct the modulus as a product of multiple primes $p_1,\dots,p_k$, i.e., $n=p_1 p_2 \cdots p_k$, where all the primes are of about the same size.  I'm wondering how much this reduces the security of RSA, for typical modulus sizes.

Let me be more concrete.  I want security comparable to that obtained with standard RSA with a 2048-bit modulus.  Can I use $k=3$ (three primes) without significant loss of security?  $k=4$?  What's the largest number of primes $k$ that I can use, without significant loss of security?  Assume that each prime is $2048/k$ bits long, so all the prime factors are of equal length.

Related: see also Who first published the interest of more than two prime factors in RSA?, which asks about the inventor of this technique.  I'm asking something slightly different; in this question, I'm not asking about its inventor; I'm asking about concrete security levels.

I've found two sources that support this conclusion:

For $k=2$ and $k=3$, the security level is 107 bits (NFS is the best attack).  For $k=4$, the article claims that the security level is 106 bits (ECM is slightly faster than NFS for four primes), so we've lost about one bit of security, though this estimate seems like it might over-simplify.

5096,5096,8104,Find volume of cask,"I was given the following question:

A wine cask has a radius at the top of $30 cm$ and a radius at the middle of $40 cm$.
The height of the cask is $1m$.
What is the volume of the cask in litres, assuming the shape of the side is parabolic?

I have to come to parabolic function of

$$y = \frac{-1}{250}(x-50)^2+40$$

The derivative of $y$ is:
$$\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{2}{5} - \frac{x}{125}$$

Then I integrate and end up with an expression the length of $\pi$. Am I on the right track?
",Luke Taylor,https://math.stackexchange.com/users/86007,"We place the centre of the cask at the origin, and assume that the cask is symmetrical about its mid-plane. 

Consider the parabola $y=40-kx^2$. At $x=50$ we want $y=30$. So $k=\frac{10}{2500}=\frac{1}{250}$.  

We will rotate this parabola about the $x$-axis. The resulting solid is the cask.

It is useful to integrate from $x=0$ to $x=50$, and double. By the usual formula, the volume, in cubic cm, is
$$2\int_0^{50}\pi\left(40-\frac{x^2}{250}\right)^2\,dx.$$

1441,1441,2270,Can the socket in my recessed light be replaced without replacing the entire framing kit?,"I have recessed lighting in my living room.  One of the bulbs went out.  I tried replacing it with a fresh one, but no luck.  There is electricity flowing to the socket, but the socket appears to have gone bad.

I bought a replacement socket at Home Depot, but upon disassembling the light, I realized that I might not be able to replace the socket alone.

I have a Lightolier Lytecaster 1102 Frame-In-Kit.  Details here:

http://www.lightolier.com/MKACatpdfs/1102D1.PDF

http://www.lightolier.com/MKACatinstr/IS_1102.PDF

It doesn't look like the socket can be removed from the porcelain socket housing.  Does this mean I have to replace the entire framing kit?  I tried calling Lightolier support, but so far I've only gotten an answering machine.

Here are photos of the enclosure:



And how the socket is fastened: 



SOLVED: See Dan's answer below. I don't know how I missed it, but inside the socket there are screws.  The socket is not riveted to the enclosure.  Alas, I did have to buy the whole Frame-in-Kit to get the correct socket, but at least I didn't have to remove the entire frame from the ceiling.  I just unscrewed the socket and screwed in the new one.
",Rob Sobers,https://diy.stackexchange.com/users/167,"I've done it twice, in 2008 and just now.  Several problems:  1) old socket is riveted; 2) tight space to rewire.

I drilled the old socket out (through the rivet).

Next cut off any remaining rivet bur for a smooth flat surface.

Buy a replacement ceramic socket for a ceiling light.  The one I bought had both black and white wires attached to the socket and a few inches of wire to work with.  This is better than a replacement socket without the lead wires as it is very difficult to attach the black and white wire coming out of the pot to the replacement socket.  

Detach the mounting bracket that allows you to screw the socket onto a threaded post.  You don't want it because it will bring your socket down an inch or so and you wont get your end cap back on the fixture.

That mounting bracket was secured by a small screw.  Find a larger sheet metal screw narrow enough to go throw that hole. Also make sure the head of the screw is small enough to fit in the recess area of the replacement fixture.

Drill a hole into the top of the ceiling pot, the right size to securely hold the screw.  When I just recently removed my socket there was a black circular washer spacer attached to the top of the pot used as a buffer against the old socket.  There was a center rivet (which I had cut out) but at 12, 3, 6, and 9 o'clock positions there remained marks (I guess from the four screw hold openings of the old socket).  One of these had been drilled but it was too big for my new screw.  So I drilled a smaller hole in another position.

Secure the socket with the new screw.

There is only one place for this new screw so it will make for a lopsided attachment.  That is the socket wanted to lean towards the side where it was attached by the screw.  To solve this I added three tiny washers to the top side of the screw.  This way the socket was not leveraged to that end when tightened.

Indeed, there is a 50px difference. You could change the midpoint of rotating before rotating by translating:

5131,5131,8162,How to modify source port in mount application linux,"I need to modify mount app, so that I can specify the source port to be one specific one not the randomly generated by the OS.

so when you do the command the destination port (ie the port 10.0.0.55 is listening ) is fine but when you do the command the source port is randomly generated by the os and that is the port 10.0.0.55 uses to reply back to the other pc that pc is behind a router so there have to be an specific port

4368,4368,6947,What are the rules of thumb for margins in web design?,"My web designer tells me that in a web page, the empty margins or padding should always be multiples of a standard. For example 6 px, 12px, 18px. This should produce nicely balanced lay-outs. I would like to learn a little bit more about it:

Should one really not violate this at all?

Should the standard be the same horizontally and vertically?
",Tintels,https://ux.stackexchange.com/users/4703,"
The best learning resource for this would be a good introduction on typography – probably the seminal classic by Bringhurst (see http://webtypography.net for a good roundup applied to the web), though e. g. Spiekermann's ‘Stop Stealing Sheep…’ is not bad for starters, either – and on design grids (see my answer here on UXexchange).
When designing grids you are mostly using a basic module (proportions ideally defined by working from the content outwards) that all content is fitted to (i.e. multiples of it).
Vertical and horizontal margins between blocks are in most cases different. Vertical whitespace is often oriented on the baseline grid (see e.g. Bringhurst, again). Using one is highly recommended to achieve at a unifying vertical rhythm.
The minimum amount of horizontal whitespace, i. e. primarily the separation between columns of body text (gutter), is governed by Gestalt psychology with font size, line spacing, and line width as main influencing factors. You should place text blocks far enough from another such that your recipients will be able to see them as distinct units of their own. A traditional rule of thumb would make the gutter at least 1.5 ems wide in order to appear significantly wider than any possible whitespace within a line of text. On the screen, good line spacing tends to be a little bit wider than in traditional print, though. Hence you will probably need a little bit more than that. Using the same value as your baseline grid is a good guess to start with in most cases.
BTW: design standards – unless significantly backed up by ergonomics or cognitive psychology – are never standards in the more rigid sense of the word. You may violate any ‘standard’ as long as you know why you are doing it.

I thought I have some weired issue with Debian Wheezy &amp; gparted. So, I reformatted the hard drive to NTFS. Before that I ERASED the partition table. 
And created a new single NTFS partition. 
Bingo! RPi, identified the partition. However, it claimed my Drive is now 2TB big, and recommended I will use GPT:

whoops! That is WRONG!

So, I disconnected the hard drive again. re-connented it to my laptop. I erased the partition table again, and re-created the partition table using fdisk on RPi! not on my laptop! This time, I took a short cut, and created the disk partition with ext4 directly. 
    I plugged the hard-drive to RPi and BINGO!

conclusion (?)

My guess is that gparted in Debian Wheezy includes some nasty bug which is sometimes showing it's ugly face. I would report a bug if I had more solid evidence. But ... since I have only one 500GB hard drive, and I don't want to
risk the health of this hard drive reformatting it so many time, I will settle this with it. If you happen to bump into this post, and you have had similar problems with large SATA drives and partitioning on wheezy, I would be happy to know.

whoops! That is WRONG!

So, I disconnected the hard drive again. re-connented it to my laptop. I erased the partition table again, and re-created the partition table using fdisk on RPi! not on my laptop! This time, I took a short cut, and created the disk partition with ext4 directly. 
    I plugged the hard-drive to RPi and BINGO!

conclusion (?)

My guess is that gparted in Debian Wheezy includes some nasty bug which is sometimes showing it's ugly face. I would report a bug if I had more solid evidence. But ... since I have only one 500GB hard drive, and I don't want to
risk the health of this hard drive reformatting it so many time, I will settle this with it. If you happen to bump into this post, and you have had similar problems with large SATA drives and partitioning on wheezy, I would be happy to know.
",I have a 500GB hard disk formatted with ext3. I have connected to my RPI using a USB - > SATA enclosure and everything is OK. It's just archilinus. So I don't think there is any limit to the disk size of RPI.

3060,3060,4874,Lychrel calculator (Project Euler 55),"
  If we take 47, reverse and add, 47 + 74 = 121, which is palindromic.
  
  Not all numbers produce palindromes so quickly. For example,

349 + 943 = 1292,
1292 + 2921 = 4213
4213 + 3124 = 7337

  
  That is, 349 took three iterations to arrive at a palindrome.
  
  Although no one has proved it yet, it is thought that some numbers,
  like 196, never produce a palindrome. A number that never forms a
  palindrome through the reverse and add process is called a Lychrel
  number. Due to the theoretical nature of these numbers, and for the
  purpose of this problem, we shall assume that a number is Lychrel
  until proven otherwise. In addition you are given that for every
  number below ten-thousand, it will either (i) become a palindrome in
  less than fifty iterations, or, (ii) no one, with all the computing
  power that exists, has managed so far to map it to a palindrome. In
  fact, 10677 is the first number to be shown to require over fifty
  iterations before producing a palindrome: 4668731596684224866951378664
  (53 iterations, 28-digits).
  
  Surprisingly, there are palindromic numbers that are themselves
  Lychrel numbers; the first example is 4994.
  
  How many Lychrel numbers are there below ten-thousand?


This is my solution:

from datetime import datetime

candidates = []

def reverse(number):
    ''' Returns the reverse order of an integer,
        for example: reverse(123) returns the integer 321 '''
    number = str(number)
    return int(number[::-1])

def is_lychrel(number):
    ''' Returns True if 'number' is a lychrel candidate,
        but works only with numbers from 1 to 10000 '''
    iterated = number + reverse(number)
    for i in range(25):
        rev_iterated = reverse(iterated)
        if iterated != rev_iterated:
            iterated = iterated + rev_iterated
        else:
            return False
    return True

if __name__ == '__main__':

    start_time = datetime.now()

    for number in range(10001):
        if is_lychrel(number):
            candidates.append(number)

    time = datetime.now() - start_time # To get the time of the calculation

    print('In {} were found {} lychrel candidates'.format(time, len(candidates)))
    print(' '.join(map(str, candidates)), 'are candidates.')
    suml = input('Press ENTER to close ')

",matheussilvapb,https://codereview.stackexchange.com/users/37913,"1. Comments on your code


Python has a built-in module, timeit, for measuring the execution time of small code snippets. So there is no need for all that fussing about with datetime.
Project Euler problem 55 says:


  you are given that for every number below ten thousand, it will either (i) become a palindrome in less than fifty iterations


but your code only tries 25 iterations. It happens to be the case that 25 iterations are enough in this case, but how did you figure that out? If you had a mathematical proof that showed that 25 iterations were enough, then that would be fair enough, but I suspect that in fact you re-ran the program with different values for the count of iterations until you found that smallest one that produces the right answer. This seems like cheating to me: if you are willing to do that, why not just replace the whole program with:

print(answer)


which would be even faster?
The problem statement asks:


  How many Lychrel numbers are there below ten-thousand?


but you test range(10001) which is off by one. Luckily for you, 10,000 is not a Lychrel number, so this doesn't lead to an error.
You've made candidates into a global variable, and run some of your code at top level. This makes it hard to test your program from the interactive interpreter. You need something like this:

def problem55(n):
    """"""Return a list of Lychrel candidates below n.""""""
    candidates = []
    for number in range(n):
        if is_lychrel(number):
            candidates.append(number)
    return candidates

2. Speeding it up


The problem statement only asks how many Lychrel numbers there are, so there is no need to construct a list of them.
Function calls in Python are moderately expensive, so you can save some time by inlining them. This leads to an implementation like this:

def problem55_1(n, m):
    """"""Return the count of numbers below n that do not lead to a
    palindrome after m iterations of reversal and addition.

    count = 0

5809,5809,9202,Performance Counters for SQL Server Related to iSCSI Disk Access,"I am planning to my SQL server databases (plus TLogs and TempDB) to a new LUN on our iSCSI SAN.

I want to measure the performance of the current configuration and the new configuration as I move each database over and ensure that I am not starting to hit any disk performance issues (or see if I am actually increasing the performance).

There are a bunch of posts on the internet on SQL performance counters such as this one, but I am really interested in just the few that are related to network/disk usage and any latency or limits that associated with disk reads/writes.  What are some of the important SQL or Windows performance counters that I should look at to create a current baseline/comparison for iSCSI disk access for SQL?
",bmccleary,https://dba.stackexchange.com/users/21462,"I agree with Mr. Denny.  

When analyzing disk performance issues I would look into this counters. 

Avg. Disk sec/Read - is the average time, in seconds, of a read of data from the disk.

Avg. Disk sec/Write - is the average time, in seconds, of a write of data to the disk.

1883,1883,2993,Implementing a NoSQL and RDBMS compatible DAO,"What would be the correct way to design a DAO which implementation is first going to be targeting a MS SQL database with a STAR model, but yet, business requirements specify the application must be flexible enough that it would be able to be migrated to a NoSQL database in the future if required. Which type of NoSQL, no idea...

My confusion is that i cannot seem to figure out how could I build independent DAOs for the STAR Dimensions and Facts tables which could then be swapped for a completely different model that might not even be table oriented (riak/mongo/whatever). 

Therefore,

Should I create DAOs which rather than abstracting the table, it abstracts the CRUD operations - for example create IDaoInsert which can then be implemented as SQLInsertDaoImpl and MongoInsertDaoImpl, each with a completely different model logic etc.

or

Should I just create the typical DAO design whose interface would be something like IDaoCustomerDimension, and the implementation SqlDaoCustomerDimesionImpl and MongoDaoCustomerDimentionImpl respectively?

Hibernate/Etc are out of the scope of this question for the time being.

5654,5654,8963,Goalkeeper Jumping Algorithm?,"This may be a ""best way to"" question, so may be susceptible to opinion-based answers (which is ok for me). But I would also like if there are any tutorials , research papers , etc.

I'm trying to make a 3D free kick game, and I want to decide on the Goalkeeper algorithm.

Usually (and in my game) the shot is a function of direction , power and swerve. Maybe wind can be a factor too. So the shots trajectory is pre-deterministic, i.e., the point that intersects the goal (or out) plane is determined as soon as the shot fires.

So what could be a good approach for the goalkeeper to jump (or walk) ?

I have two approaches in mind :

1- determine the point, and jump to there. 
2- when the ball is closer than a threshold distance, estimate the point by the ball's velocity vector, and jump to there.

The problem with the first approach is, goalkeeper will always save the shot, which I want to prevent. So there should be some kind of randomness, or the goalkeeper's ability to jump and walk will be restricted.

The problem with the second approach is, when there is a high amount of swerve, the goalkeeper will always fail to save the shot.

So how could these approaches be better?

Thanks for any help !

If they are just chosen values, then they shouldn't have such a direct effect, or the player will always choose them to be high.

You could set a percentage of the time you want the goalkeeper to save (based on the speed and swerve), and simply pick a random number, if it's below that percentage, play the correct animation (diving the right way) for the save, if it's higher, play the wrong one and allow the score.

I cannot find mentions of skills being fixed in such fashion in hotfix logs since 2.0.1, and the only mention in patch notes is that before 2.1.0 Ancients did snapshot attack speed when summoned. But latest hotfixes mention fixes to legendary item procs snapshotting quite a bit.

5184,5184,8236,Does a terminator have a form of self-preservation or prohibition against suicide?,"This weekend I was watching Terminator 2 (editor cut). In the end, after T-1000 is destroyed, Arnold asks Sarah and John to destroy him by melting and says ""I cannot destroy myself"".

So, what does this mean? The terminator cannot destroy himself unless it is absolutely necessary in order to succeed in his mission (like protect John?)?

In that case, what was the Terminator in part 1 going to do after the success of his mission (i.e. destroy Sarah)? Just live a long happy life and wait for Skynet arise?

Update:
I understand that this is not the exact Third law of Asimov, since the terminators definitely don't follow the First or Second law. Let's call it the law of self-preservation. Does terminator have a form of self-preservation to some point and the prohibition of suicide?
",SPIRiT_1984,https://scifi.stackexchange.com/users/4435,"Disclaimer:  For the sake of building a rational explanation, I am going to assume that skynet does not have any knowledge of the three laws.  That assumption is based on the obvious fact that they do harm humans, and allow humans to come to harm by any means necessary.

I do believe that a T800 as designed by SkyNet is fully capable of self termination.  For example, if one were facing capture by the resistance, it would be beneficial to SkyNet for the terminator to destroy itself, thus rendering the technology useless to the enemy.  Plasma weapons would be effective in rendering any computational hardware unrecoverable, while the endoskeleton is less of a concern in 2018-2027.

So why would a Terminator capable of self termination be unable to self-terminate when sent back in time?  Ignoring the fact that plasma rifles are in short supply in the 1990's, prior to being sent back, John Connor instructed the Terminator with its mission parameters one of which could have been to have John or Sarah destroy the Terminator in a way that would not leave any recoverable technology behind.

A Terminator can only self terminate itself to the point it stops functioning, but technology can still be recovered.  Recovering this technology in the present is what allows SkyNet to be developed.  Self-termination would not completely satisfy the requirements set forth by the parameter, and thus the Terminator cannot comply.  The only other alternative would be for someone to continue to reduce the machine into harmless metal.  It's convenient, however, that the movie ends in a metal foundry. 

I know someone is going to ask ""Why not jump into the molten metal, then?""  I like to believe that John would have wanted his younger self to learn a lesson of loss, and having to face a tough decision.  Old John knows his mother is going to die soon, and losing the Terminator will help him do a practice run through the grieving process. He might also want to have himself develop an animosity toward the machines as he gets older...hating them for forcing him to destroy the machine he grew to love.  We can see some of this resentment in T3, when he has an attitude with the Terminator.  This could be some of the fuel for the fire inside John Connor of the future...

4312,4312,6869,How do animal perceive distances with their eyes and ears,"I am studying how animals (including the human beings) can perceive distances thanks to their eyes and their ears. I am focusing on the fact that they always go in pairs: two eyes, two ears, etc.

About the sight, I think our eyes use the parallax. But is this enough? Is this the only way we can perceive distances with them?

About the sounds, I think it is merely by interferometry, but I am not convinced, because the distances between our ears and the wavelength are not always comparable to one another.

What do you think about it?
Thanks in advance,

All of these systems work together when you look at objects in the real world, but in for example 3d movies and tvs only some are active, which can cause various sorts of dizziness or headache among viewers.

With regards to hearing, apart from loudness and phase the auditory system also uses timing of onset, this obviously relates to phase discrimination depending on the audio frequency and size of the head.

3438,3438,5468,Developing a dynamic language,"I have created several hand written compilers for very simple languages but now I want to try my hand at developing a dynamic language, similar to a simplified Python or Ruby.  However, it was easy for me to wrap my head around how compilers work.  Primitive compilers just translate.  But I can't do this if the language is dynamic.  I have to write an interpreter or VM that keeps track of information at runtime and puts a lot more work on me.

In short, are there any resources I should check out considering I know how compilers work but want to migrate to creating an interpreter?  There are a few VMs out there for dynamic languages, but I have no problem with rolling my own.  This is all just for my personal experience.

EDIT: I am seeking information on how to go from a compiler to an interpreter.  If I have already made a compiler for language X but now what to write an interpreter, what needs to be done and are there any resources that go over the process?

I do not want broad or abstract resources that go over how compilers or virtual machines work.  I have plenty of textbooks on the subject.  All of the resources I found online either assume you have 0 experience and thus start you off with lexical or syntactic analysis or they are extremely abstract.  I have a working compiler, but I now want to turn this into an interpreter and add dynamic features to the language.

I could not find resources on this process, it may be too limited in scope, or resources on the ""back end"" of an interpreter without being too theoretical which is why I posted here.
",Austin Henley,https://programmers.stackexchange.com/users/37315,"If you want to learn the basics of implementing an interpreter for a dynamic language, I can't imagine a better place to start than the origins of the very first dynamic, interpreted programming language: Lisp. 

In his original 1960 paper, John McCarthy defined 5 primitive functions necessary to a Lisp. Of course, McCarthy only intended his paper on Lisp as an academic exercise; it was a graduate student who implmented eval in assembly and created the first Lisp interpreter. Paul Graham identifies seven primitives: quote, atom, eq, cons, car, cdr, and cond.

I know that if you create a subclass object in the subclass and assign to a superclass reference that is outside of the subclass's package and try to call a superclass method, this is not allowed.

Thanks for all the comments, I drive a lot (30kmiles/year) and I saw (to my surprise) a significant difference with nitrogen.

Does it mean that if I press the pedal (or whatever) of the engine, it will apply force? Either on a diesel or a gasoline engine.

Another question: Lets say I'm driving down a hill in a relatively high speed in a car, and I'm not pressing the gas pedal at all. Does the engine burn fuel at all, in both diesel and gas? If I (while in gear) turn off the engine, will something actually happen? If I would press the pedal after turning it off (while it still rotates) - will it apply force? (in both diesel and gas).

If, while driving, I disconnected the idler (i.e the engine won't apply any force if I'm not pressing the pedal at any RPM and pressing the clutch will take it to zero RPM) and press the brake until I get to a complete stop, will the engine ""stall""? If I'm doing it in a hill facing down, after releasing the brakes I'd accelerate and the engine would gain RPMs, will it be able to continue applying force?

Finally: What's the difference between a ""running engine"" and one thats not running, assuming both are rotating?

I'm sorry if I'm asking too much so if you would at least explain the principle I'd be very happy. Thank you!
",Mark Segal,https://mechanics.stackexchange.com/users/3112,"I will explain it for an EFI engine with a manual transmission because it might not be as straight forward with a carbureted engine or automatic.

For ease of explaining this I will consider the engine as ""on"" whenever the ignition switch is set to the ""on"" state. This means that the ECU is on and is monitoring the engine state and controlling it's behavior. 

For the bicycle example with an EFI engine if you had your ""ignition"" to on while you started cycling then the ecu would start to inject fuel and cause spark so yes it would apply force and use fuel. If the ignition were off then the ecu would be off and you wouldn't get any fuel or spark so no you won't get any force if you apply the accelerator.

Going downhill not pressing the accelerator with the ignition on will use significantly less fuel (not sure if the ecu uses zero fuel though) and the engine will still be sparking for sure. If you were to turn the ignition to accessory while coasting downhill the ecu will shut off and you will stop injecting fuel and stop spark as well so the accelerator would no longer do anything.

If you have the clutch in and you stop the engine will stop. If you then release the brakes and roll down a hill then one of two things will happen.

1) if your ecu is on (ingition on) then the engine will start to use fuel and spark. (It will be really rough until it gets to ~700rpm)
2) if your ecu is off then the engine will rotate but no fuel or spark so therefore no acceleration.

Finally the difference between a running engine and not if they are both spinning :

A running engine is one which can continue to run from the energy it is producing without an external force. Modern engines require fuel air and spark to satisfy this requirement. eg. ECU on and rotating

An engine is off if when all external forces are removed then engine would stop. eg. the ecu is off so the engine isn't producing any of its own power and is only spinning because it is connected to wheels that are being accelerated by gravity.

Hope this clarifies it somewhat....

2117,2117,3371,Developing a dynamic language,"I have created several hand written compilers for very simple languages but now I want to try my hand at developing a dynamic language, similar to a simplified Python or Ruby.  However, it was easy for me to wrap my head around how compilers work.  Primitive compilers just translate.  But I can't do this if the language is dynamic.  I have to write an interpreter or VM that keeps track of information at runtime and puts a lot more work on me.

In short, are there any resources I should check out considering I know how compilers work but want to migrate to creating an interpreter?  There are a few VMs out there for dynamic languages, but I have no problem with rolling my own.  This is all just for my personal experience.

EDIT: I am seeking information on how to go from a compiler to an interpreter.  If I have already made a compiler for language X but now what to write an interpreter, what needs to be done and are there any resources that go over the process?

I do not want broad or abstract resources that go over how compilers or virtual machines work.  I have plenty of textbooks on the subject.  All of the resources I found online either assume you have 0 experience and thus start you off with lexical or syntactic analysis or they are extremely abstract.

For your language, you'll be able to reuse the compiler's front-end (parser, mostly) and run-time library (GC, data structures, primitive operations, etc).

Of course, you can also implement a dynamic language with a compiler that produces code that manipulates (some of) the same data structures that you would use in an interpreter. For example, in an interpreter you might implement global variables as a string-indexed hash table. In a compiler, you would compile global variable references into the code that does the lookup using the same table.

2365,2365,3771,Is it usual for finished PhD students to send out physical copies of their thesis to unknown persons?,"Some time ago, a recently-graduated PhD has sent me a physical (book) copy of his dissertation. The graduate works in a somewhat-related field, but is personally entirely unknown to me (I have some loose connections to the advisor, though). I was reasonably confused by this - I personally have never heard of a custom of sending physical theses to anybody besides maybe parents. I was 100% convinced that I received the dissertation in error (also because the mailing was addressed to my name, but using a wrong department name).

Last week I by chance got hold of the graduate and told him that he sent me his thesis by accident, and asked whether he wants to have it back. He seemed confused and a little bit annoyed that I wanted to give his thesis back - it turns out he actually sent me the book on purpose, assuming that I would be interested in his work. He told me that he thought it is customary to send a finished PhD thesis to people that he thought might profit from its results.

So, is this a thing, at least in some fields? If so, why not just send the core papers or a link to a digital version of the thesis? Mailing out printed copies seems extremely expensive, and also (at least for me) very unlikely to result in anything else than me having another book gathering dust in my office shelf. I am honestly very unlikely to read an entire thesis, especially if I only have it in a dead-tree book version.

357,357,566,Are some tires safer than others?,"I bought a Bell Road tire from Walmart. Since I haven't exactly had great luck with Walmart bicycle products, I looked up the reviews... not so great.

In their defense, they are 1.375, not 1.25, but still, the things couldn't stay on my bike... in a sharp, low-speed turn with minimal leaning from me, the bead just popped off!

Then there is the Continental Gatorskin tire with a much better set of review on amazon.  But, does it matter?

I know I'm being a little specific, but what I want to know is how do I minimize my chances of my tires trying to kill me?

I realize this may look like a shopping question, but I have to purchase tires that I use!

I'd appreciate any advice from guys who actually have enough experience to really comment on tires.
",user1833028,https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/users/7136,"It sounds as though your problem was a somewhat loose tyre not properly seated. It may have been loose enough that it couldn't be properly seated, but in that case I'd expect it to pop off and the tube explode while you were pumping it up for the first time. You may also be running the tyres at too low a pressure, with a skinny tyre like that I'd expect them to need 70psi or more.

So, seating a new tyre: 


fit the uninflated tyre and tube as you normally do
pump it up to 10-15psi - just enough that there's air in there but it's still very spongy
ideally spin the wheel, but just looking around it also works. Look for bulges or dips in the tyre sidewall relative to the rim, ideally using a line around the tyre (a moulding line or the reflective strip).
when you see a dip down into the rim, grab the tyre firmly on both sides and rock your hand to pull that bulge up into the correct position.
when you see a bulge upward you need to pull the rest of the tyre down. Start 1 few inches past the bulge and rock the tyre up (as above), then repeat this around the tyre until you're back at the bulge (which should be gone by now)
repeat on the other side of the tyre.


Steps 4 and 5 are easy to skip, and the reason why you want very little air in that tyre. The ""explode on first inflation"" thing happens occasionally in bike shops, and it's a chance for everyone else to laugh at whoever did it. After getting over the shock of the loud noise!

Normally this is just a quick eyeball check of both sides of the tyre, and I'll often skip it with tyres that are tight on the rim. If it's hard to get on, it'll usually seat firmly as soon as air goes in. But loose tyres I'm very careful of (see ""loud noise"" above).



(edit to add)

Picking Tyres

My impression is that many (most?) cyclists I know go to a local bike shop and talk to people, see what's available, and buy something they can actually touch. At least once, anyway, before going ""I can get these much cheaper online"". Having decided on a brand or brands, and a preference for fat/slick/kevlar-studded and so on, they then grind through a few options over the next few thousand kilometres of riding before developing either very strong preferences (like the bike geeks here), or a complete lack of interest. Working in a bike shop I really did get people who brought bikes in and said ""tyre. flat. replace. bye"" then walked out, leaving me holding a bike going ""can I at least get your phone number?""

Availability is also important. If you're going to try some tyres with a view to picking one you like, pick a manufacturer that's been around for a while and doesn't change their darn tyres every year. Otherwise every time you buy a tyre you have to work out which one best matches the one you bought last year. If you're buying online, try to pick a store that keeps stuff in stock. It's annoying buying something only to wait a month while it gets shipped from a warehouse in China when you chose a ""local"" online store.

So, my preference is for puncture resistant to very, very puncture resistant slicks, with more puncture resistance on my commuter and less on my touring bike (where rolling resistance is more important). On my velomobile I went for extreme puncture resistance because going much faster also meant that the time taken to stop and fix a puncture stood out a lot more. Spending 10 minutes fixing a puncture on a 20km ride that should have taken under 30 minutes is more annoying than I expected, so after it happened once I went for serious puncture resistance. I also prefer a brand (Schwalbe) and apart from a few older Maxxis tyres that haven't worn out yet, all... 6... bikes in our shed have Scwalbe tyres. Marathon Plus through to Marathons, with Duranos on my 700c ""lazy bike"" (takes less effort to go faster than by other bikes, therefore ""lazy"")

Somewhere there's a photo of a 3"" nail sticking through a marathon plus on my bike. Not, I emphasise, puncturing the marathon plus, just ""zombie tyre"" poking through it, with one side of the nail head ground flat where it had hit the ground every time the wheel went round. That's freakishly unusual, but it's one reason why I like the marathon plus tyres.

84,84,139,I want to build a portable railgun and I'm a complete rookie,"I'd like to enter the world of electronic hobbies by making a railgun, and so far I know that I understand the basics of the device and that I need high amounts of direct current.

However, I am puzzled, as to where to begin calculating. I'd like to set myself X amount of joules/kjoules of electric energy and work from that, but I know stuff like rail length and how the rails push eachother apart would affect performance, so I'd like to know;


How Farads relate to Joules (I know the J/V^2 formula but that wasn't clear enough)?
Should I opt for a single powerful capacitor or a bunch of smaller ones, especially since I want to unload the charge as fast as possible?
What kind of conductive metal should I use that would be both conductive enough for acceleration and durable enough to resist the recoil and other forces involved?
How should I cool it or deal with the heat? 
Would there be much heat to begin with in a portable railgun?
Would ABS coating be a proper body for the gun, protecting the user from the lethal amperages that will be involved?
How exactly does rail length help the case, as I would use a bipod for a long rifle if that will increase my efficiency?
Would it be a better idea to have conductive bullets, insulated bullets with discarding and conductive sabots, or a stable aperture that will simply stop at the end of the barrel by whatever means I can come up with while letting the unbound insulated bullet out? 
Should I keep my circuit simple as to just use switches, a battery, capacitor, and some LEDs, or are there more efficient circuit components?
I'd like to have a control mechanism that lights the Red LED when it is charging, green when it is charged, how can I do that? In my simple sketchup of the circuit I have V-switches (don't know the technical name) aligned in a way that the lights should light correctly during the course of my planned three stage trigger, but better ideas are obviously welcome.
Will a capacitor lose its current when neither of the ends are connected to a complete circuit but both of them have wires attached to them? I am guessing not but better safe than sorry.
Is there a way to make sure the capacitor has depleted its entire charge? 
What would be a good idea to improve safety and efficiency?


Thanks in advance!
",lychnus,https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/23933,"A 10g projectile moving at 100m/s has a kinetic energy given by 1/2 m (v^2), ie 50J.

Assume 10% efficiency, so you need to supply 500J from the capacitor bank. Assume we're using your 16milifard suggested number. Rearrange F = J/V^2 to V = sqrt(J/F). That yields a comparatively modest 176V. Of course, that's the energy in fully charging them, and you can't use all of it due to the voltage drop.

Assume a 50cm rail and a stationary projectile to start (in practice they're launched in mechanically). By s = (v1 + v2) t/2 that gives us 1/100s time of acceleration. That yields an instantaneous power of 50kW and current of ~280A. Delivering that kind of current requires extremely low resistance wiring and busbars and will be quite hard to achieve in a portable design. I suspect that a practical design will use a higher voltage to offset this problem and offset the voltage drop as the capacitors discharge. Perhaps only the top 10-20% of charge can be used effectively.

Putting switches in the power path is to be avoided as the current will tend to weld them shut.

Heat issues: one shot will dump a few hundred J of heat into the rails and air around them. Air cooling will do for low rates of fire.

Safety: is a relative term. You're never going to get this thing CE approved. Shrouding the whole thing in ABS (or PVC piping) to keep fingers away from high voltage, temperature, and moving parts is a good start. I'd apply an insulating varnish or conformal coating to all exposed metal on the internals (except rail active surfaces) as well, as an attempt at double-insulation and to keep out moisture.

Charge indicator: this is really the least of your problems. Start with a voltmeter.

Cap discharge: they will stay charged to lethal voltages! ""Bleeder resistors"" are usually used to drain them off. Note that discharging a 500J pack through a 1W resistor will have to take at least 500 seconds. Voltmeter comes in handy here for watching the discharge.

Sabot: I don't think this is normally done, and it complicates the whole thing hugely.

Construction: you have a bit of a mechanical engineering problem in ensuring that the rails are securely fixed but at the same time electrically isolated from each other and the chassis. You can get insulators to fit around screws and bolts, but the clearance required to do this at kV levels may be a problem.

Getting the rails parallel enough and contacting the projectile without too much friction or arcing is also going to be a problem.

System.out.println(""The number of vowels in \"""" +phrase+""\"" is ""+ vowels+"".\n\nThe number of consonants is ""+consonants+"".\n\n"");


When ""y"" is by itself it says its a consonant, it should be a vowel. Where do I state this?
",MrAwesome8,https://stackoverflow.com/users/3250237,"There are several things going on here:


j.equalsIgnoreCase(""a,e,i,o,u"") will check if j (a length 1 string) is the string ""a,e,i,o,u"", which is almost certainly not what you want (since it's always false and therefore you set y=true for every consonant). Instead, consider setting a boolean value to false at the beginning of each iteration and setting it to true in the vowel branches. Then, if that variable is true, you know that this time you saw a vowel. Or just have the else branch.
You initialize y to false outside the loop, but once y is true it never gets reset, and so for each letter you will run the if (y == true) block.
Right now, your system only accounts for words with 1 y and no vowels. If you enter ""yyy"", you'll get 1 vowel &amp; 2 consonants.


Stylistically, there are a lot of other changes you can make to make your program easier to read through and debug. Here are a few:

You don't have to do ""== true"" when checking a bool. For example, instead of ""if (y == true)"" just do ""if (y)"".

All the vowels are handled the same, so you don't need separate branches for each. For example, you could have:

if (j.equalsIgnoreCase(""a"") 
    || j.equalsIgnoreCase(""e"")
    || j.equalsIgnoreCase(""i"")
    || ...)
{
    vowels++;
}


In fact, you can simplify this further by checking against a collection of vowel values, using a regex, or in this case, simply using contains:

boolean isAVowel = ""aeiou"".contains(j.toLowerCase());


Consider counting y's separately, so you keep track of vowels, ys, and constants in 3 separate counters. Then, at the end you can decide whether to add ys to vowels or consonants.

Finally, add a System.out.println(""vowels = "" + vowels + "", consonants = "" + consonants + ""..."") to the inside of your loop during the debugging stage. This will make it a lot easier to see what is going on and where things start to go wrong.

5708,5708,9047,Windows Software to Mount Volume/Partition Image File,"Last night I had a BSOD a couple of minutes after moving a file. After a reboot, I found that the file was gone (it was deleted from the source partition and not present on the destination).

I took an image of the source volume (ie from the Boot Sector to the last cluster of the partition). Then I wrote a program to extract the unused clusters from a disk and save them as files.

Some of the free clusters on the original volume have now been overwritten so I need to use the image to do my final extraction. That means I need some software that can mount a volume/partition image, but all of the image mounting software I can find can only mount disk images (ie from the MBR—the master partition table—on).

Does anyone know of (hopefully free) Windows software that can do this?

I’ve already tried (without success): VirtualCloneDrive, DaemonTools, VirtualFloppyDrive (and probably a couple of others I can’t think of). They all either nag that the file is no good, or try to mount it, resulting in a disk that Windows complains has an unknown/corrupt filesystem.

3677,3677,5863,2D AABBs and resolving multiple collisions,"Okay, so this is a problem I've been trying to figure out for quite some time. Mine is a 2D platformer game with a world made up of (usually) immobile tiles and mobile sprites, both of which use AABBs to represent their hitboxes. This game is NOT grid-based due to some complications with moving layers of tiles.

I can detect collisions and easily figure out the depth of the collision. I use the ""shallowest axis method"" to determine which way to resolve a collision between the sprite and the tile. If the sprite is deeper horizontally than vertically, the direction to resolve is either up or down. If the sprite is deeper vertically than horizontally, the direction to resolve is either left or right.



This is simple enough, and it works pretty well. That is, until you have a sprite colliding with more than one tile. As, by their nature, each collision has to be checked separately, different collisions may have different direction to resolve in. For example, if a sprite is trying to walk across a row of tiles, for one frame they will intersect the next tile such that the horizontal depth is shorter than the vertical depth. As the collision says ""resolve left"", it will be pushed back and will be stuck on the corner.



I've been mulling this problem over, on and off, for quite some time, and several solutions have come to me, but all have flaws. I could mark certain sides as unreachable, but without a grid-based engine, determining ""unreachability"" is remarkably complex, especially with moving layers of tiles always a possibility.

Another possible method would be to predict collisions before they happen and ""work back"" the movement to the point of the collision, I suppose, but I'm not sure how the math on that works.

I feel that I'm missing something incredibly obvious, especially since games from the 80s have already solved this problem.
",Celarix,https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/users/34552,"The problem

The problem lies in your method of collision resolution. Your method goes as follows:


Move the player.
Check for collision.
Determine the shortest collision depth.
Resolve collision.


The problem with this, is that it can easily move the player in the wrong direction. You can see how this might happen in the image below:



Because the player is moving down to the right, and is above the ground, you would expect the player to land on top of the ground (by the green box). But instead, it gets pushed out of the ground to the left (represented by the red box). This can be a problem if the player is trying to jump from one platform to another, because the player may end up falling to his death due to bad collision code.

The solution

The solution to this problem is actually pretty simple. Instead of using the above method, you resolve collision like so:


Move the player along the X axis.
Check for colliding tiles.
Resolve X collision.
Move the player along the Y axis.
Check for colliding tiles.
Resolve Y collision.


Now I hope that you didn't throw your depth check code away, because you are still going to need it for steps 3 and 6.

To resolve collision between tiles on either of the two axes (after moving the player), you first get the depth of the collision. You then take the depth of the collision, and subtract that from the axes that you are currently checking for collision. Note that the depth should be negative if you are moving to the left, so that the player moves in the right direction.

Using this method, you will not only not have to worry about collision bugs like the one in the scenario in the above image, but this method also can handle collision with multiple tiles.

Example code:

void move(velocity)
{
    top = player.y / TILE_HEIGHT;
    bottom = top + (player.height / TILE_HEIGHT);
    left = player.x / TILE_WIDTH;
    right = left + (player.width / TILE_WIDTH);

    // Check X

    player.x += velocity.x;
    player.updateAABB();
    for(int tx = left - 1; tx &lt;= right + 1; tx++)
    {
        for(int ty = top - 1; ty &lt;= bottom + 1; ty++)
        {
            aabb = world.getTileAABB(tx, ty);
            if(aabb.collidesWith(player.aabb))
            {
                depth = player.aabb.getXDepth(aabb);
                player.x -= depth;
            }
        }
    }

    // Now check Y

    player.y += velocity.y;
    player.updateAABB();
    for(int tx = left - 1; tx &lt;= right + 1; tx++)
    {
        for(int ty = top - 1; ty &lt;= bottom + 1; ty++)
        {
            aabb = world.getTileAABB(tx, ty);
            if(aabb.collidesWith(player.aabb))
            {
                depth = player.aabb.getYDepth(aabb);
                player.y -= depth;

4688,4688,7433,Silverlight: Returning value from synchronous method using Rx,"I am writing a simple Silverlight application and WCF Service.
I want to create a synchronous method that return a value.
The method itself, call an asynchronous method from WCF Services. After I call asynchronous method, I want to get it value, and return to sender.
I hear that Rx can solve this kind of problem.

This is my code :

    private void btnCreate_Click(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
    {
        string myResult = getMyBook(txtBookName.Text);
        MessageBox.Show(""Result\n"" + myResult);
        // myResult will be use for another purpose here..
    }

    // I want this method can be called anywhere, as long as the caller still in the same namespace.
    public string getMyBook(string bookName)
    {
        Servo.ServoClient svc = new ServoClient();
        string returnValue = """";

        var o = Observable.FromEventPattern&lt;GetBookCompletedEventArgs&gt;(svc, ""GetBookCompleted"");
        o.Subscribe(
            b =&gt; returnValue = b.EventArgs.Result
            );

        svc.GetBookAsync(bookName);
        return returnValue;
    }


When I click btnCreate, myResult variable still empty. Is that something wrong with my code? Or maybe I am just don't understand with Rx concept? I am new to Rx.

My goal is : I need to get the result (myResult variable) from asynchronous method, and then used in later code.

2577,2577,4101,Exporting (bullet) collision shapes,"I'm writing a scene exporter from blender to a format to be used by a game. I need to be able to export physics information the game needs, mainly the collision shape of every object (either the one set in Blender Render or Blender Game but the latter is better).

I cannot seem to find anywhere that the collision shape is available to python. I've seen references to PhysicsConstraints.exportBulletFile() but this appears to be under the bge module, which as far as I can tell, is not accessible by exporter scripts. Is there any way to determine the details of a shape (rotation and scale, width, height, depth for box or radius and height for cylinder, vertices for convex hull, etc...)?
",luminus,https://blender.stackexchange.com/users/1789,"Finding the parameters necessary to generate such a shape should be possible with python.

From the wiki:


  The Shape setting determines the collision shape of the object. The
  following shapes are available:
  
  Primitive shapes - these are best in terms of memory/performance but don't necessarily reflect the actual shape of the object. They're
  calculated based on the object's bounding box. The center of gravity
  is always in the middle for now.
  
  
  Box: The size per axis is calculated from the bounding box
  Sphere: The radius is the largest axis of the bounding box
  Capsule: This points up the Z-Axis.
  Cylinder: This points up the Z-Axis. The height is taken from the z-axis, while the radius is the larger of the x/y-axes.
  Cone: This points up the Z-Axis. The height is taken from the z-axis, while the radius is the larger of the x/y-axes. 
  
  
  'Mesh based shapes' - these are calculated based on the geometry
  of the object so they are a better representation of the object. The
  center of gravity for these shapes is the object origin.
  
  
  Convex Hull: Convex approximation of the object, has good performance and stability.
  Mesh: Allows to simulate concave objects, but is rather slow and unstable.
  


To build these shapes using the UI:

Box:


Select the target object and press CtrlShiftAltC > Origin to goemetry, and then press F6 and select bounds center.
With the target object selected, press ShiftS> Cursor to selected to move the cursor to the objects origin.
Add a cube to be the bounding box. It will automatically be centered at the 3D cursor, which is snapped to the target object's origin point.
Copy the Dimension and Rotation values from the target object to the bounding cube. These values are located on the Properties region (N in the 3D view):



You can quickly copy and paste values by hovering over the number field and pressing CtrlC/CtrlV accordingly.

Since this process of copying and pasting the values of each channel can be a bit tedious, you can use a quick bit of python to do this for you:

import bpy

active = bpy.context.active_object
selected = bpy.context.selected_objects

for obj in selected:
    obj.dimensions = active.dimensions


This copies the dimensions from the active object to the selected objects.
Parent the bounding box to the target object so the relative location, rotation, and scale is kept the same. You can also set the bounding cube's Draw type to Wire in Properties > Object > Display > Maximum Draw Type.


Sphere


Do steps 1 to 3  from the Box instructions, adding a sphere instead of a cube. 
Copy only the largest dimension value from the target into all three dimensions of the sphere.
Do step 3 of the instructions for Box (Parent the bounding mesh and set the draw type to wire)




Cylinder


Do steps 1 to 3  from the Box instructions, adding a cylinder instead of a cube.
Copy the largest dimension value of the target excluding the Z axis, so the value of either X or Y into both the X and Y dimensions of the Cylinder.
Copy the Z dimension value of the target to the Cylinder.
Do step 3 of the instructions for Box (Parent the bounding mesh and set the draw type to wire).


Cone


Do the same as for Sphere.


Convex Hull

This is more complex. you could try to generate your own using python, or you could try one of these existing options:


The Convex Hull operator built into blender. 


Duplicate target object (ShiftD)
With the duplicate selected, enter edit mode (Tab) and select all (A)

Very nice sounding trumpet although it needed more frequent cleaning than other brands I played. It originally came with a ""Frank Holton 7C"" mouthpiece but I have been using all sorts of trumpet mouthpieces on it with no problem. The only thing it wasn't very fond of is very big mouthpieces like Bach 1C and bigger, wich would make the tuning too low. After trying out many many mouthpieces I settled on a Bach 10.5C wich is considered quite small by modern standards (not by older standards), but perfect for me, even though I am a tall guy. No idea about you, mouthpieces are like shoes, they have to fit. For some reason, the general consensus is that bigger(lower number) is better, based on a 1920ties recommendation from Vincent Bach that everyone keeps repeating, but I don't agree with that. I'm sounding better than ever on this small piece and it's less straining also.

In the movie, the conflicting stories about his past are there on purpose to continue this nature of just being an agent of chaos.  

Notice how we're never given a flashback of events during his story-telling, something very prominent in the movies in order to remind the audience of events past.  Even Ra's' origins were given flashbacks, although brief and nondescript. 

The only facts to his backgrounds are that he started in Gotham, pitting low-level criminals against each other in elaborate robbery schemes where he comes out on top, with money.  

As a point of reference, the opening scene of The Dark Knight shows his most recent attempt, with a lack of surprise from Gordon on the situation of criminals killing each other during a heist.

But this is only the past year (time between the end of Batman Begins and the beginning of The Dark Knight) and the rest of his timeline is what we see in the movie.

For clarification and emphasis of the answer:

There is no true origin of the Joker in any media.



As far as the comics, the same is true: 

There are a multitude of origins of the Joker told from being a washed up comedian that went nuts, to just being that way from the start.


  Though many have been related, a definitive history of the Joker has never been established in the comics, and his true name has never been confirmed. 
  
  No recounting of the Joker's origin has been definitive, however, as he has been portrayed as lying so often about his former life that he himself is confused as to what actually happened. As he says in The Killing Joke: ""Sometimes I remember it one way, sometimes another... if I'm going to have a past, I prefer it to be multiple choice!""


source

The one true constant of any depiction of the Joker is that he wants to assert to Batman that all it takes is One bad day to send anyone into the insanity that he lives everyday.  

The most prominent of this is during the short story The Killing Joke where he tortures Gordon almost to this point.

And this is also what makes the Joker such the notorious villain that he is.  No one can ever be certain of anything of him or what he will do.  Whether it be something as simplistic as his background to any of his plans, constantly fooling even the pinnacle of detectives like Batman on multiple occasions.



As a final side note about Joker origin, the story that is most accepted as the ""true"" origin is The Killing Joke Where he quits his job to be a comedian and goes completely nuts after being knocked into a vat of acid that bleaches his body the traditional Joker colours (all caused by Batman during a heist gone wrong).  

But as there is no confirmation of this origin to the Joker, even this can be taken with a grain of salt.


  The Dark Knight's interpretation of the Joker is based primarily on the character's first two appearances in the Batman comics, as well as Alan Moore's one-shot comic book Batman: The Killing Joke, which was given to Heath Ledger in order to prepare for his role.

$('table tr').on('click', function(e) {
  var $button = $(this).find('button');  
  console.log('trigger click on', $button);

});


The click event propagates up, and will cause a never ending loop (can be seen here: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/kDxHy) 

After some searching on SO, it is clear that the solution is to call event.stopPropagation,
like this (can be seen here: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/BnlfA):

$('table tr').on('click', function(e) {
  var $button = $(this).find('button');

      e.stopPropagation();

    return true;
  });

  console.log('trigger click on', $button);

  $button.trigger('click');

The solution above works. But it feels like a hack, and I don't like it. 

Do I have to register a click handler on the on the $button just to call event.stopPropagation? Are there any better way(s) of preventing the click event from bubbeling?

389,389,611,Doctors working on Shabbat,"What are some general guidelines regarding the halakhic permissibility for Jewish doctors to work on Shabbat?  I know that saving lives generally overrides Shabbat, but I am curious about less black-and-white situations that may occur on Shabbat, such as having a shift where one must be in the hospital or be on call, receiving medical training, etc.  Also, in a practical halakhic sense, are there any situations in which the appropriateness of violating Shabbat would depend on whether the patients are Jewish?  I'm sure that these are not simple questions and that there are likely multiple opinions on various issues, but some insight into this topic would be welcome.
",Sam,https://judaism.stackexchange.com/users/9,"I'm sure there are several lectures on YUTorah.org about this; probably an article or two in Journal of Halacha &amp; Contemporary Society as well.  But in short:

""having a shift where one must be in the hospital or be on call"" -- we generally try to avoid putting ourselves into a situation in which a matter of life-or-death might occur which would necessitating violating Shabbat; this ""try to avoid"" can be balanced out by other considerations, though.  (That's one explanation given for why the Mishna prohibits getting on a ship too close to Shabbat -- a life-or-death situation may occur -- but if taking the trip is a mitzva, it's allowed.) 

""receiving medical training"" -- a tough issue, as usually the life-or-death situation must be fairly immediate, not ""oh this may allow me to save some life out there someplace, ten years from now.""  Nonetheless, I'm told that Rabbi Dovid Cohen of Brooklyn has allowed people to take residencies that may require working on Shabbat.  But check with your own rabbi.  

""are there any situations in which the appropriateness of violating Shabbat would depend on whether the patients are Jewish?"".  That's easy.  No.  The Halacha is that we violate Shabbat to save any human life; that's the Halacha, that's the practice, that's what we do.

2472,2472,3939,Nuclear fusion - Hydrogen isotopes,"What is the isotope composition of hydrogen atoms in the sun? Are the ratios of protium:deuterium:tritium similar to those we find on earth?

What does the nuclear fusion of hydrogen atoms in the sun look like? Can protiums participate too? Where does, then, the helium atom get a neutron from, as there are no neutrons in protiums?
",Roll,https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/66492,"The main fusion reaction in the sun is the proton-proton chain reaction, which takes six protons and produces two protons, one alpha particle, two anti-electrons, and two electron neutrinos.

The deuterium nucleus is only barely bound and can be destroyed — dissociated into a proton and neutron — by absorbing a gamma ray with energy more than 2 MeV. This means that all of the sun's ""primordial"" deuterium, formed in the first minutes after the Big Bang, was destroyed before the sun got hot enough to begin fusing on its own. Essentially all of the deuterium in the sun exists as an intermediate step in the proton-proton fusion cycle.

Tritium, furthermore, is naturally unstable, with a half-life of only 12 years. This means that any tritium in the sun (or anywhere else) has been mostly produced in the past few dozen years.  On Earth tritium is produced by cosmic rays interacting with stable matter.  In the sun most of the tritium would come from neutron capture on deuterium (where I suppose the neutrons would have come from dissociated deuterium) or nucleon-exchange or proton-knockout reactions on helium-3 and helium-4.

A relatively authoritative solar model I grabbed some time ago from this paper (or more properly, from here) lists the helium-3 fraction, but not the deuterium fraction or tritium fraction.

Is the ratio of protons to deuterium and tritium similar to what we found on earth?,"The main fusion reaction in the sun is the proton-proton chain reaction, which takes six protons and produces two protons, one alpha particle, two anti-electrons, and two electron neutrinos.

The deuterium nucleus is only barely bound and can be destroyed — dissociated into a proton and neutron — by absorbing a gamma ray with energy more than 2 MeV. This means that all of the sun's ""primordial"" deuterium, formed in the first minutes after the Big Bang, was destroyed before the sun got hot enough to begin fusing on its own. Essentially all of the deuterium in the sun exists as an intermediate step in the proton-proton fusion cycle.

Tritium, furthermore, is naturally unstable, with a half-life of only 12 years. This means that any tritium in the sun (or anywhere else) has been mostly produced in the past few dozen years.  On Earth tritium is produced by cosmic rays interacting with stable matter.  In the sun most of the tritium would come from neutron capture on deuterium (where I suppose the neutrons would have come from dissociated deuterium) or nucleon-exchange or proton-knockout reactions on helium-3 and helium-4.

A relatively authoritative solar model I grabbed some time ago from this paper (or more properly, from here) lists the helium-3 fraction, but not the deuterium fraction or tritium fraction. If we assume they are comparable (or at least related) then you can see that it still depends on where you are in the sun:

You can't build them on industrial scale (to put it somewhat insensitively, OCP didn't have a ready supply of highly trained and freshly killed police officers)

So, Robocop seemed like a prototype that could never have entered production. Total waste of R&amp;D money.
And having a police brain (because he already know police procedure) seems not necessary since at the same time OCP could build fully AI robots (from robot chicken, flawed as it was, in Robocop 1, to Ninja Androids in Robocop 3).

However, when the ED-209 spectacularly failed during a boardroom meeting, Bob Morton took the initiative:

3179,3179,5066,Understanding one-way hash functions construction,"I understand the needs that lead to the development of cryptography and I am quite familiar with the uses we make of the cryptographic tools.

But, as a programmer, I am conditioned to see them as ""black boxes"" with specific properties. To me, SHA-X (with X being 1, 2 or 3) is some dark magic, even though I understand why I need it and use it.

That said, I am eager to find some literature to light this up.
From what I have read so far, I have seen that the common mathematical demonstrations consist of games and the evaluation of the winning advantage of an enlightened attacker over a player that would just randomly take decisions. This is exactly the kind of things I am looking for : what mathematical background lead to this construction for this hash function. Learning through an example can be worthy, but the more global this maths background is, the better.

To say it in other words, how does a cryptographer prove the essential properties of his design ? In the case of cryptographic hash functions, these properties are one-wayness, collision resistance and preimage resistances.

What are the logical steps, starting from the required properties, that lead to the specification of a hash function ? How are these properties translated into mathematical definitions ?

Note : I think I needed to ask that last question because for a cryptographic hash function, I feel there is the need to define some thresholds somewhere.
",Rerito,https://crypto.stackexchange.com/users/4977,"First, it's important to understand that no one knows how to build a practical hash function that is provably secure.

The stuff you've read about games and advantage are part of a theory for proving schemes secure, but that theory doesn't help you build a provably secure hash function all that much.  Rather, it starts from the assumption that a particular hash function is secure (or a block cipher or stream cipher is secure), and then builds more complicated stuff out of those basic building blocks.  So, that theory doesn't help us design the basic building blocks, like hash functions, in the first place.  (Sometimes the theory is used to help guide the design of the structure of a hash function, where designers build a hash function out of a building block like a compression function.  The designers might use the theoretical analysis to demonstrate that if the compression function is good, then the hash function will be good -- but it doesn't help you with the question of how to design a good compression function.)

For more details on how we know that a hash function is secure, see my answer to a similar question (on the IT Security Stack Exchange site).

Generally speaking, to learn how to build a secure hash function, you start by learning about all of the various attacks on hash functions.  Then, you try to design a hash function that will resist all of those attacks (as well as all others you can imagine).  Therefore, a good starting place for you would be to read about attacks on hash functions.

You could start by reading Chapter 9 of the Handbook of Applied Cryptography.  Also check out Wikipedia's articles on cryptographic hash functions and the Merkle–Damgård construction.

1221,1221,1916,How to synchronize actions like jump in multiplayer?,"I am a newbie game developer and I have been researching about multiplayer games. I observed that there's always some latency, the players always get updates from past actions. But there are techniques like dead reckoning to handle the latency. I can predict the movement and make movements smooth. But how would I make actions synchronize like jumping, stopped walking, etc.

Suppose, client A was moving, he was at 100m at 10.2 time with 100m/sec velocity and sended this information. Client B would receive this information somewhat later, let it be 10.4. So at client B, I can use prediction and place client A at 120m. But what if, client made a jump at 110m at 10.3. I can't predict that and since I have been using prediction I can't show client A jump in past.

I may deal with this problem by not sending jump action at all. But what if my game has some voids where players can fall and die. So, If I don't sync jump actions, other players will observe that one player was running then he falls in void and then again appear on the screen destroying the visual engagement. 

Jump is just an example, there might many scenarios where prediction can't work. So, How do deal with them. One such example can be Multiplayer Online battle arena games like Awesomenauts.

4157,4157,6628,Replace multiline string in files,"I have a number of files I want to update by replacing one multi-line string with another multi-line string. Something along the lines of:

* Some text, 
* something else
* another thing


And I want to replace it with:

* different text


The result would be that after the replacement the file containing the first block of text, will now contain the second string (the rest of the file is unchanged).

Part of the problem is that I have to find the list of files to be updated in the file system, I guess I can use grep for that (though again that's not as easy to do with multiline strings) then pipe it in sed maybe?

Is there an easy way to do this? Sed is an option but it's awkward because I have to add \n etc. Is there a way to say ""take the input from this file, match it in those files, then replace it with teh content of this other file"" ?

An interesting functor $F_H:\bf Semigroup^1 \to \bf Monoid$ is given by the functor which leaves the monoid objects unchanged, and modifies the homomorphisms by replacing the image of the identity by the identity of the target monoid. Is this a left or right adjoint functor to $G_H$?

As Martin Brandenburg wrote in a comment, it is not clear whether $F_H$ and $F_O$ are functors at all. In fact, they fail to be functors, because $F(g\circ f)=F(g)\circ F(f)$ fails.

For $F_H$ look at
$\begin{matrix}

Hence $F_H(g) \circ F_H(f)$ and $F_H(g \circ f)$ are different.

Here, the vertical stars ""describe"" specific semilattices (commutative idempotent semigroups), where the result of a multiplication is the lower of the two involved stars (i.e. the meet or the greatest lower bound).

Yes, it is very likely in your best interests.  If you have other interviews at comparable schools, then you will benefit from saying so.  If you don't, then it's not so clear.  However, departments will assume your job search is not going well if you are reluctant to address the issue and they haven't heard impressive rumors about your interviews, so avoiding discussing interviews won't really help.  Instead of saying something awkward like ""I'd rather not talk about that"", it's better to be up front and optimistic.  ""This is my first interview"" is better than ""This is my only interview so far"".

Here are a few reasons why telling about other interviews can help your case:


As a general rule, people want something more if they know other people also want it.  Valuing a second opinion is rational behavior.
Even when it doesn't change the outcome, competition can speed things up.  If a search committee member is trying to make an offer and still needs some final committee or administrative approval, it's helpful to be able to say ""Let's move fast, since she is also interviewing at X, Y, and Z, and we'd like to make a good impression by coming up with the first offer.""  If it's too late for that, they can say ""She already has an offer from X, so we need to act before she decides.""


In principle, you could hurt your chances if you list a lot of schools typically considered much more desirable (which could make the school you are currently interviewing at feel they would just be wasting their time trying to compete).  However, in this case you are probably already in trouble, since the rumors of your busy interview schedule may already worry the search committee.  Instead of trying to cover things up, it's better to acknowledge that you have these other interviews.  If you are worried about this risk, you can address it by making your interest clear throughout the interview.

Instead of trying to cover things up, it's better to acknowledge that you have these other interviews.  If you are worried about this risk, you can address it by making your interest clear throughout the interview.

6049,6049,9599,Are mutliple database calls really significant with a network call for a web API?,"At one of my employers, we worked on a REST (but it also applies to SOAP) API. The client, which is the application UI, would make calls over the web (LAN in typical production deployments) to the API. The API would make calls to the database.

One theme that recurs in our discussions is performance: some people on the team believe that you should not have multiple database calls (usually reads) from a single API call because of performance; you should optimize them so that each API call has only (exactly) one database call.

But is that really important? Consider that the UI has to make a network call to the API; that's pretty big (order of magnitude of milliseconds). Databases are optimized to keep things in memory and execute reads very, very quickly (eg. SQL Server loads and keeps everything in RAM and consumes almost all your free RAM if it can).

TLDR: Is it really significant to worry about multiple database calls when we are already making a network call over the LAN? If so, why?

To be clear, I'm talking about order of magnitude -- I know that it depends on specifics (machine hardware, choice of API and DB, etc.) If I have a call that takes O(milliseconds), does optimizing for DB calls that take an order of magnitude less, actually matter? Or is there more to the problem than this?

Edit: for posterity, I think it's quite ridiculous to make claims that we need to improve performance by combining database calls under these circumstances -- especially with a lack of profiling. However, it's not my decision whether we do this or not; I want to know what the rationale is behind thinking this is a correct way of optimizing web API calls.

1035,1035,1628,A family of polynomials with symmetric galois group,"Consider the following family of polynomials in $K[x,y]$, where $K$ has characteristic zero:

$f_n(x,y)=(x+y)^n+(x-1)y^n,$

for $n\geq 3$.  I can prove that $f_n(x,y)$ has an irreducible factor of degree $n-1$ in $x$. I also know that the galois group of $f_n$ over $K(y)$ is the symmetric group of degree $n-1$, but am having trouble proving this.

Here is an alternative form for $f_n$: make the substitution $x\rightarrow xy$ and divide by $y^n$.  this gives:

$g_n(x,y)=(x+1)^n+yx-1.$

Substituting $-n$ for $y$ in $g_n(x,y)$ we get:

$g_n(x,-n)=x^2h(x),$

where $h(x)$ is separable (EDIT: $h(x)$ is the subject of this question).

Alternatively, substituting $x\rightarrow x-1$ into $g_n(x,y)$ gives us a polynomial which factors as:

$(x-1)(x^{n-1}+x^{n-2}+\ldots +x^2+x+y+1)$

It seems as though it shouldn't be hard to show that some specialisation of $y$ into this gives a polynomial with galois group $S_{n-1}$ over $K$...but I'm well and truly stuck.

Any advice much appreciated! 
",MrB,https://mathoverflow.net/users/2189,"[Edited mostly to incorporate references etc. from Michael Zieve]

The polynomial $(x^n-1)/(x-1) - y$ has Galois group $S_{n-1}$ over ${\bf C}(y)$ for each $n$, as expected.  This answers one of the three problems; the question statements asserts that they are equivalent, which doesn't seem to be the case (see my comment there), so I hope I'm answering the intended one.

The proof combines group theory and polynomial algebra (as might be expect) with algebraic topology, which might be a bit less expected.  The connection is as follows.  Let $S$ be the Riemann sphere with coordinate $y$, let $P(x,y)$ be any polynomial of degree $d&gt;0$ in $x$, and let $S'$ be the Riemann surface corresponding to $P(x,y)=0$.  The rational function $y$ on $S'$ gives a map $S' \rightarrow S$; let $B = \lbrace y_1,\ldots,y_b\rbrace$ be its set of branch points, and fix some $\eta \in S$ not in $B$.  Then $\pi_1(S-B,\phantom.\eta)$ is a free group on $b-1$ generators, with generators $g_1,\ldots,g_b$ (where each $g_j$ is a loop from the base point $\eta$ around $y_j$ and back to $\eta$) subject to the single relation $g_1 g_2 \cdots g_b = 1$.  These lift to automorphisms $\tilde g_j$ of $S' - y^{-1}(B)$ such that $y = y \cdot \tilde g_j$, and thus to permutations $\pi_j$ of the $d$ sheets of $S'$ above $S$.  Then the key fact is that


  The Galois group of $P(x,y)$ as a polynomial over ${\bf C}(y)$ is the subgroup of $S_d$ generated by the permutations $\pi_j$.


In our case $P\phantom.$ has the form $p(x) - y$.  In general I think it is known which polynomials (or even rational functions) $p$ yield $p(x)-y$ with Galois group other than $S_d$, but it's not easy and involves the classification of finite simple groups!
[Actually even less is known; the groups have been determined, but the polynomials, not quite, even in the polynomial case.  See below.  But this is tangential to the question at hand (albeit a fascinating tangent) because the ensuing argument is enough.]
Fortunately in our case the following sufficient condition is all we need:


  Let $p\in {\bf C}[X]$ be a polynomial of degree $d$.  Assume that the derivative $p'$ has distinct roots $x_1,\ldots,x_{d-1}$, and that the numbers $y_j = p(x_j)$ are also pairwise distinct.  Then $p(x)-y$ has Galois group $S_d$ over ${\bf C}(y)$.


[Naturally this result is not new, but I was still surprised to learn from Mike Zieve of its true age and pedigree: Hilbert (1892)!  See below.]

Proof: Here $b=d$ and the branch points are $y_1,\ldots,y_{d-1}$ and $y_d = \infty$.  Since $P$ is a polynomial, $\pi_d$ is a $d$-cycle.  (This already proves that the Galois group is transitive, that is, that the polynomial is irreducible; but we already knew this because it is obviously irreducible over ${\bf C}[y]$.)  Each $\pi_j$ for $j&lt;d$ is a simple transposition.  So we have $d-1$ transpositions whose product is a $d$-cycle.  But we readily prove the following by induction on $d$:


  Let $s_1,\ldots,s_{d-1}$ be $d-1$ simple transpositions of $d$ letters.  Then TFAE: (i) $s_1 s_2 \cdots s_{d-1}$ is a $d$-cycle; (ii) $s_1,\ldots,s_{d-1}$ generate a transitive subgroup of $S_d$; (iii) $s_1,\ldots,s_{d-1}$ generate $S_d$; (iv) the graph on $d$ vertices in which two vertices are adjacent iff they're permuted by some $s_j$ is a tree.


Here (i) is satisfied, so (iii) holds and the Galois group is $S_d$ as claimed.

[NB we cannot drop the condition that the $y_j$ be distinct; e.g. the Čebyšev polynomial $T_d$ has dihedral Galois group, which is smaller than $S_d$ once $d&gt;3$, even though $T'_d$ has distinct roots $x_j$, because $T_d(x_j) = \pm 1$ for each of them.]

It remains to check that the hypothesis on $p$ is satisfied when $d=n-1$ and $p=(X^n-1)/(X-1)$.  For lack of a better idea I did this by computing the discriminant of the polynomial
$$
q(y) = \frac{(n-1)^{n-1} y^n - n^n (y-1)^{n-1}}{(y-n)^2} \qquad (1)
$$
of degree $n-2$ whose roots are the $y_j$, and checking that it is nonzero; in fact
$$
\mathop{\rm disc} q(y) = \pm 2 \Delta_{n-1} \Delta_n
$$
where $\Delta_m := m^{(m-1)(m-3)}$ (and the sign depends on $n \bmod 4$).  The formula for $q$ was obtained from the familiar expression $\pm \bigl( (n-1)^{n-1} A^n - n^n B^{n-1} \bigr)$ for the discriminant of the trinomial $x^n - Ax + B$.  It follows that the numerator of (1) is $\pm$ the discriminant of $x^n - xy + (y-1) = (x-1) (p(x)-y)$ as a polynomial in $x$, whence (1) soon follows; substituting $y = nz/(nz-(n-1))$, and using the covariance of the discriminant under ${\rm PGL}_2$ together with the same trinomial formula, soon gives the claimed $\pm 2 \Delta_{n-1} \Delta_n$ (the factor of $2$ arises at the end from a double application of L'H&ocirc;pital's rule), QED.

What can i possibly do wrong? The passphrase IS the word pass .

I created my .crt by doing :

openssl req -config openssl.cnf -new -out ipm.csr -keyout ipm.pem

openssl rsa -in ipm.pem -out ipm.key

openssl x509 -in ipm.csr -out ipm.crt -req -signkey ipm.key -days 365

410,410,636,"""God is Fire"": Trying to Source an Analogy for Prayer","I remember reading once a very clever analogy, which I was sure that I had found in the writings of Yeshayahu Leibowitz (who sourced it, from memory, in the writings of the Rav, R' Yosef Ber Soloveitchik, who himself sourced it in the Rambam), but I can no longer locate it at all. In essence, the analogy stated that God is like fire. Different objects, when dropped into the fire, react differently. Some become hard. Some become soft. Some let off smoke. Some change their hue. Some make a noise. Some might explode. But while all of these different reactions can be found, at no stage is the fire anything other than a fire; the difference in responses to it is to be found in the different objects that come into contact with it.

So too, the analogy concluded, when it comes to our relationship with God. When we pray, we change ourselves in order that God might interact more favourably with us. We do not hope for God to change in any way, but for ourselves to change instead. God's influence upon the world is constant and unchanging; it is we who are in flux.

Does this analogy sound familiar to anybody? If you can direct me to a printed source (be it in the writings of the Rav, or Prof. Leibowitz, or whomever it was who came up with this), I would be much obliged.
",Shimon bM,https://judaism.stackexchange.com/users/1659,"From zaq's answer to a related question:


  In the Moreh Nevuchim [(Part 1 ch.53)], Rambam explains how God's attributes should be understood without compromising God's unchangingness.
  
  He compares God's mood to a fire. If you put ice in a fire, it melts, then evaporates. If you put clay in a fire, it hardens. If you put wood in a fire it burns... The fire causes many different and contrasting effects without changing the fire's properties. The same ""fire melts certain things and makes others hard, it boils and burns, it bleaches and blackens."" It is the properties of each individual material that elicit a different interactions with fire.

2549,2549,4056,Scaling FFT output by number of points in FFT,"When computing the N-point FFT of some signal, the result is always divided by N. I can understand why this is the case for a summation over the N points, but often the result of the FFT operation is a vector of length N rather than a summation. Why then is the length-N vector that is the output of the FFT scaled by the number of points (N) used to compute the FFT? Thanks.
",john,https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/7814,"The difference is that the digital Fourier transform (and FFT as well) gives a vector of size N (or M in some cases) that contains sums of N samples.

So, basically, each point of the FFT transform is the result of a sum over a certain time interval of the time-based samples. That's why you divide by N.

You can consider it this way: you take an interval of N samples of your signal; then, you basically sum all the samples N times, but each time multiplying them for a different function, that allows to extract the information for a specific frequency (or frequency range, to be more accurate).

At the end, in summary, instead of having N samples, each one associated to a time interval, you have N samples (as before) but each of them related to the whole interval and describing the component of the signal for a specific frequency range.

Just for completeness, there are four cases of Fourier transform:


Continuous Fourier transform, for continuous signals in time, over a finite interval, that gives a continuous frequency response;
Fourier series, taking a continuous and periodic signal and giving the discrete series of harmonics, so with discrete frequencial components;
Time discrete Fourier transform, the reciprocal of (2), in which from a discrete-in-time signal gives a periodic function in the frequency domain;
Digital Fourier Transform, that takes a discrete and periodic signal to give a discrete and periodic spectrum.


So transforming a periodic signal gives a discrete spectrum and vice versa.

3116,3116,4964,Lock for extremely frequent use,"Are there lock products out there specifically designed for easy handling when locked unlocked dozens of times a day?

I'm using a normal, chain-based lock at the moment and I'm annoyed because


I'm doing constant slight damage to the frame when removing the lock from the bicycle
I need to carry a key at all times, fumble it from my pocket when it's time to go (often in a thankless, noisy, roadside environment), and fumble the lock back onto the bicycle


Are there any solutions out there that make frequent use as painless, and still as secure, as possible? I'm thinking about something that works like a remote-controlled car door lock. It should, however, still be possible to attach the bike to an object to prevent it from getting carried away.

82,82,135,"What's a better method, using Large Array vs SQL Joins?","I can't decide on w/c technique to go w/... although I am tempted to go the Array way as it is much more straight forward and easier/cleaner to code...

lemme explain in a simple way..

For my messaging app, I have 2 tables


Contacts - contains name, and phone number (currently 5,000+ records)
Messages - messages and the phone number, but not the name of the member


I need to list 1000 Messages, w/ the corresponding phone number and name if possible...

eg.


""Hi dude"" - from 565-1111 (John)
""Bring Cheese"" - from 565-2222 (Bieber)
""Hehehe "" - from 565-2332
""iron man is cool!"" - from 565-7748 (Arnie)


etc...

I would normally join contacts to messages via the phone number... pretty standard stuff...
(but in reality my queries are a bit more complex than a simple left join)

Now, i've been playing around w/ the idea of fetching all contacts and putting it into an array where my app/system could use it in a much easier , more straight forward and cleaner code... where:


query SELECT * contacts


and store them into an array:

contacts['555-7748'] = ""John"";
contacts['555-1111'] = ""Joe"";
contacts['555-2233'] = ""Borat"";
contacts['555-4234'] = ""Arnie"";
etc


this way i can easily lookup the NAME of the Contact via accessing the array, many times in my page/script, just by simply doing:

$name = contacts[$phoneNumber];


I have actually implemented this and it's really cool .. no more join headaches and re-querying contacts table etc.. 

now the question is.. is this OK? Practical? or could i be hitting some memory cap or something here? 

it's basically running JOIN query on EACH message my script outputs
or
store ALL THE CONTACTS/RECORDS into array (memory) and refer to that instead, making queries are more simple.. 
my only worry is, querying thousands of records into an array, may be a bit too much? or is this really OK/practical? specially since there are times when my script needs to fetch specific contacts more than once...

To add, I was also thinking of storing that array into a Session variable! lolz.. so my scripts can simply share this data.. lol 

looking forward to some good inputs
Thanks guys.



---- UPDATE as of 03-31-2013 (Sunday)  ----



Ok... I'm thinking about a totally different approach now..

1) SINCE all this is really me needing  to show the ""CONTACT NAME"" for each message for neat/presentation purposes (better to see the name of the contact on a message rather than phone number yeh?) .... 

2) and since each message will need to show 2 contact names  (receiver and sender) based on their phone numbers on the MESSAGES table..... 

3) I now am thinking of ADDING 2 fields into the MESSAGES table instead... ""sender_name"" and ""receiver_name"" ..  I have seen Bulletin board / Forum software use this technique a lot ..

4) when system receives a message , it checks for existing Contacts entry of the numbers associated w/ the message...and if it exists, get the respective names and include it into storage/insert 

5) ..problem is if during the message was received, contact info isnt available, so no NAMES are saved.. and later CONTACT info is then created... the OLD messages wont show the contact names as intended... 

6) 3 way solution... 1st, evertime a new contact is added/changed my php will make updates to all messages w/ the matching numbers... 2nd, from time to time perhaps once / month, run a ""synchronize routine"" to make sure things are in sync..  or, when a user Actually OPENS a message, mandatory routine will run to check if contact name of that particular message is still in sync w/ the contacts table information... and make updates as necessary.. 

hmmm... better approach you thing? this way, i just need to issue straight forward SELECT queries , simple, fast.. but am able to display the names.. 

then again, i still kinda find that QUICK array reference thing so cool though.. lolz

",BrownChiLD,https://stackoverflow.com/users/1797947,"It sounds as if you've decided how to proceed, in which case I'd suggest looking into the most efficient method to manage your list. ""Sharing"" it across sessions I've not encountered (who do not share sessions for security reasons, or shouldn't). You've nixed redis.io and Memcached as too complicated. 

One way you could do this, and minimize it's impact in efficiency, would be to setup a CRON or configure some workers to periodically run a script that outputs the contacts table to a PHP-parseable file.

For instance:

&lt;?php

// Let's not run this if the app isn't accessing it.
if (!defined('APP_RUNNING_CONST')) {
    header('HTTP/1.1 401');
    exit;
}

$contacts = $db-&gt;query()... // Get the contacts list.
$lines = array();
$num_contacts = $contacts-&gt;getRows();

while ($contact = $contacts-&gt;nextRow()) {
    $contact-&gt;field-&gt;contactname = addslashes($contact-&gt;field-&gt;contactname);

    array_push($lines, ""\$contacts['$contact-&gt;field-&gt;phone'] =&gt; '$contact-&gt;field-&gt;name';"");
}

if (!empty($lines)) {
    $o_array = implode(PHP_EOL, $lines);
    $c_date = date('r');

    $o_array = ""&lt;?php

// CRON contact table cache to array
// Saved $c_date by __file__
// Number rows: $num_contacts

$contacts = array();
$o_array

"";
}

// Write the PHP file over the last:
$contactsfilename = 'contacts.php' ...


Then all you need to do is 

include '/secure/lists/contacts.php';


in the pages you need it. You should be careful how you replace the file (copy, save and delete when finished) as well. 

Some other improvements you could make might be to output files for each area code/prefix....

contacts.403.555.inc.php
contacts.403.585.inc.php
contacts.461.550.inc.php


And then create a function to autoload the appropriate file group only as you need them (""lazy loading"") and use static variables to keep the references in the function. This also overcomes the global variable problem, as well as helps keep the functional code accessing the files in a central place. Of course you could use a class, maybe with an array interface implementation.

Anyhow, yet another option could be to use a ini file format.

3953,3953,6307,Open Source Scripting Languages that work well with Microsoft SQL Server,"I have been using PHP for a number of years now and have found it to be (relatively) well documented, easy to work with, to setup and to use.

One of its main advantages is its capablility of working, without many modifications, similarly on a Windows or *nix platforms.

It also has good support for connecting to Microsoft SQL Servers, in particular 2005 + 2008 through the mssql module + ntwdblib.dll or FreeTDS.

That being said, the more time I spend developing PHP, the more I feel the need to pick up another scripting language to broaden my skill set and to develop better web-based applications.

Because of this I've spent some time exploring alternative scripting languages in an effort to evaluate their suitability.

At present the biggest hurdle I have come accross is support provided by recent versions of the Open Source scripting languages, specifically: Python 3.2.2, Ruby 1.9.2, Node 0.5.7 for the Windows OS (WinXP in my case) and Microsoft SQL Server (2005 + 2008).

My existing working environ necessitates the requirement for connecting to a MSSQL database.

I'm looking for answers from developers who have experience working with either Python, Ruby or Node.js and using them to interacting with a MS SQL Server.

351,351,557,Making sure that you have comprehended a concept,"Hi,

I have a question that I've been thinking about for a long time.

How can you assure yourself that you've fully comprehended a concept or the true meaning of a theorem in mathematics?

I mean how can you realize that you totally get the concept and it's time to move on to the next pages of the book you're reading?

Thanks in advance for your responses.
",Axiom,https://mathoverflow.net/users/3124,"Although we all want to ""understand the concepts"", I would encourage you to measure how well you are learning mathematics not by whether you ""understand a concept"" or not (because this is in the end too vaguely defined) but by whether you can use what you have learned to do something useful. For students, this usually means doing the problems at the end of the section or chapter. For those using mathematics as a tool (like Steve Huntsman), it means writing software that uses the mathematics learned. For both students and professionals, it also often means working out the details usually via computations of examples that illustrate what you have just learned. And, of course, if you are or are striving to be a pure mathematician, it can also mean using what you learned to prove other mathematical statements you want or need.

If you are able to do any of these things with what you have just learned, then you should definitely move along to the next thing. Because, as others have already advised you, you might want to move along, even if you can't do anything useful yet. When learning mathematics, you should definitely try to be able to do something useful (e.g., work out examples and/or solve problems) with most of what you are learning. However, everybody runs into things that just don't sink in despite intensive effort. As long as you're learning most of everything else, it is often advisable to just move ahead and return later after you know more and are more experienced. Everything gets easier, if not on the second try, usually by the tenth.

1588,1588,2503,Is OTP useful in modern electronic communication?,"I have seen from time to time questions about various OTP schemes and ""OTP"" (i.e. stream cipher) schemes. The most common OTP troubles appear to be:


How to extend size of previously generated key or how to generate key.
How to get key material securely to the recipient.


In electronic communication or storage encryption OTP appears scheme that is impossible to make work and if it works benefits are not clear. Requirement that the key needs to be the same size than input seems to be unbearable for many of modern use cases for encryption.

Is there any practice where OTP is useful in modern cryptography except:


As a component used on some proofs.
As a example ideal of encryption algorithm.


I.e.: Is it possible to base on OTP and provide the ""information theoretic"" strength to hashing (apparently not), authentication, etc.

When I disconnect the existing circuit from the receptical, that will leave pigtails for the old circuit.

What do I do with the pigtails from the old circuit that the outlet will no longer be wired to?  

-Do they need to stay in the box(which would mean they would be pigtailed in the box, but not connected to the outlet, and new wiring would also run into the box for the new circuit connected to the outlet)?

-Get pushed into the wall?

-What seems the safest thing: Remove the outlet, leave the pigtails in the box, and put a blank over it. Then cut a new hole for a new box for the receptacle and new wiring to go into.

I am aware of the fact that if I comment on the performance of the student, it could be used against me, since it is good practice to ""erase"" all the material, marks, personal information of the students and staff relationship at a previous job. So I am hesitant to go in that direction. On the other hand, I could comment only very generally on the skills of the student, which could backfire their application to a new job

Differently from this question I am not looking for a recommendation, but giving one...

2401,2401,3832,How do native speakers 'guess' the pronunciation of the letters in a word they see for the first time?,"I confess! Being a non-native speaker, I struggle a lot especially when I come across a new word. And I wonder how do native speakers pronounce perfectly even though they read the word for the very first time. There should be some rule/technique? I'm not sure.

Let's take a case. 

If I see a word having 'ch' for the very first time, how do I guess it? Remember, I don't have dictionary. Nor do I have access to this great site when I encounter that word. For example, 

Take the word 'chariot'. Being a non-native with quite limited knowledge of orthography, I know that 'ch' is pronounced as in 'Charles'

But then, imagine, I came across the word 'charade'. Undoubtedly, for me, it is 'ch (as in Charles)-re-d-s'. But then, actually, 'ch' there is 'sh' (as in Shane). 

It's not just 'ch' but it goes for 'g' as well. 'G' as in 'goat' or 'g' as in 'gymnastic'. Is there any source that teaches how to pronounce a letter if it is placed after/before certain letter? Is there any such rule? The one I remember is when a word ends with 'mb', you don't pronounce 'b'. 'Bomb', 'Comb', 'Tomb' and many other words ending with 'b'.  



There are a few more words that add another nail in the coffin of my pronunciation complexity! 


  penis (pee, and not as in 'pen')  asthma (no 'th' pronounced)  Dengue (dengeee)  and many more...

",Maulik V,https://ell.stackexchange.com/users/3187,"Since pronunciation changes over time, any system of spelling that was mapped to pronunciation at a point-in-time would eventually get out-of-sync with the way people are speaking.  

The system of spelling also has to make a choice (explicitly or implicitly): 

a) nominate a ""standard"" pronunciation, so that from the get-go the system would not map to regional variations in pronunciation; or 

b) reflect regional pronunciation, so there would be many ways to spell the same word. 

The latter was the case before English spelling was standardized. There are dozens of ways to spell the word for 'sister' in Old English, for example.

The Googles of the world would have a difficult time searching if a word might be spelled in a given text in any number of ways. All searches would have to be phonetic, and the search engine would have to understand the rules of regional pronunciation, and to the degree it did not, there would be misses and false positives galore.

It's possible to ""get close"" when guessing a pronunciation, but that's about it.
If you don't recognize the word as a loan-word from another language, say, and so may be following some special rule, you won't stand much chance of guessing right. For example: depot. But for the most part, spelling of English  words does follow some basic phonetic rules that can be learned.

      i mean listen port, min max

if someone shows me how to fix this i will be very greatful
thanks 
","Either pasv_address needs to be the external IP address, or pasv_addr_resolve=YES needs to be set so that the hostname you entered will be resolved when vsftpd starts.  If you use a hostname with pasv_addr_resolve, vsftpd has to be restarted if the IP address changes.

My target is to have a very fast 2-d data structure to store cells in a spreadsheet.

I'll store ""all columns within a row"" in a hash table. Then do this to all 'r' number of rows. Next make the final hash table for rows and store all the 'r' number of hash tables in the new hash table. is this way efficient? or is there a better way?

3452,3452,5493,Are programming books in other languages useful for Python?,"I'm a self-taught intermediate Python programmer; I frequently come across popular books on software development and programming written in other languages (often Java). 

Typical examples:


Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code
Design Patterns, Gang of Four
Test Driven Development: By Example
The Art of Unit Testing: With Examples in .NET


Generally speaking, how useful is it to read a book written for another language? Specifically, what about Python? Should one stick to language specific books? 

For example, a lot of people praise Design Patterns by the GOF, I've never read it because the model applies to other languages (after all Python is about anti-patterns, right?) yet I feel the urge to because of it's place in the CS literature cannon. 

Likewise, would The Art of Unit Testing: With Examples in .NET help a Python programmer learn unit testing even though the examples are in .Net? 
",Jason Wirth,https://programmers.stackexchange.com/users/21104,"First of all, some of the books you mentioned are written with examples in multiple programming languages. For example, GOF's DP is written with C++ and, if fewer, Smalltalk examples, and TDD is written with Java and Python examples.

If you are well trained in picking up what's useful, dropping what's not, and translating what you've picked up, you'll benefit from reading most of generally recommended books for programmers. However, if you have little experience in doing this, you could start from ""near-transfer"" books. Otherwise, you will learn very little, or even you will learn bad ideas and habits -- some of the practices are language-paradigm dependent. I have seen a good deal of Python programmers with all the hassles for implementing GOF's DP in C++.

Transfer is psychological and educational term for applying what you have learned in a different context. They differentiate between near and far transfer. Usually near-transfer is easier and more effective, which means you need to put more effort for far-transfer.

For near-transfer learning, I highly recommend learning from similar languages, in terms of its paradigm, to your target language -- siblings in the language typology. For Python, that would be something like Smalltalk -- or nowadays Ruby but Smalltalk's legacy is greater.

For instance, you will learn a lot more from reading DPSC than from solely reading GOF's DP. (BTW, reading both DPSC and GOF's DP at the same time with careful contrasting and comparing is a very rewarding learning experience)

From my near-transfer experiences, I remember leaps of improvement in my Python programming from reading books(articles, papers, and etc) for Smalltalk, APL, Io, and ICON, all of which are dynamic in nature.

Is there some way, to alter envelope sender on delivery ?  

Are smtp_generic_maps ment for this ?

",Chris.Stover,https://mechanics.stackexchange.com/users/7751,"Electric cars use high tech lithium batteries. These batteries are dangerous in a variety of situations but they're also full of electronics to compensate.

Cars are expected to handle all kinds of weather and Ford is a reputable company. I would expect all high voltage power sources to be perfectly protected from water splashing up from the wheels which would mean shallow water is fine. If the water gets up into the doors though, then you might be in trouble.

Doing some research, I found someone who's nissan leaf that was submerged for an extended period it of time (the water was half way up the door, wheels totally under water) and the car computers had detected various faults and shut everything down. A mechanic cleaned things up as best they could and the car was able to start, but more errors were detected so they declared the car a write off.

My guess is that car could have been repaired if it was taken to a more competent mechanic, but most mechanics don't know anything about electric vehicles and they're not going to risk telling you everything is fixed when they honestly don't know.

Tesla says that there is no safety risk at all if the car is fully submerged in water, but obviously it would destroy the car just like happened with the Leaf. If the battery catches fire they recommend using ""large amounts"" of water to cool the batteries down. You're likely to need to keep the battery cool for up to 24 hours, so make sure you have a lot of water available to keep the batteries cool.

My understanding is water won't put out a lithium battery fire, but it should prevent the fire from spreading into neighbouring battery cells, and eventually the ones already burning will run out of fuel.

I have an electric car that seems to be able to drive through a big puddle in the last storm, but I'm curious if anyone can tell me what the potential dangers of driving an electric car in a huge pool of water are.","Electric cars use high tech lithium batteries. These batteries are dangerous in a variety of situations but they're also full of electronics to compensate. If anything at all bad happens (for example, a short circuit due to water) the battery itself will shut down, and you'll have to get the car towed.

Cars are expected to handle all kinds of weather and Ford is a reputable company. I would expect all high voltage power sources to be perfectly protected from water splashing up from the wheels which would mean shallow water is fine.

5397,5397,8574,Vixion IRUX Tablet battery will not charge,"I bought this tablet recently in Tenerife.  Can find no information about the manufacturer.  

Now the battery will not charge through the mains adapter. It did charge at first.  However, I have found it does charge through USB connection to my PC.
When it charged previously a light at the connector would be red.  When it was not charging it would be green.  It is red while USB connected. 

Also it tells me now that it is charging, but if I remove the USB connection it stops charging. It has a screen showing battery condition in the form of a graph.  I could see the graph of battery % decreasing gradually.  A few days ago there was a sudden drop as if some App had used a lot of power.  

I decided to remove all Apps and did a factory reset.  This made no difference regarding the failure to charge. I have tried shutting down completely (hold the off button for a while and it asks if I want to power off)  

This made no difference.
Any advice please?

Edit #1: Thanks ce4 for your response. The charger is stated to be 5v and when I check it with a voltmeter, it shows 5.2v. Also I have tried pushing the plug into the tablet to varying amounts and makes no difference. Another point maybe I didn't make clear is that when I connect with USB only, the light does not come on but the device tells me it is charging.

But when I connect the power supply as well, the light comes on red as if indicating charging. But when I remove the USB leaving the power supply connected, the light goes back to green and is not charging from the power supply.

Despite apparently charging on USB, the percentage of battery left charged has not yet increased from 10%. I understand that USB cannot deliver high current. It appears you are right - something wrong with the charger - maybe it is not the correct one for this model - I guess it needs to be able to deliver power at a higher current level?

How many pumps you would need to fill up a tire depends on many variables. First, the volume of your inner tube, which can be approximated as a torus (doughnut-shape) atop the rim size of a given diameter. You can find yours approximated on this graph.


26"" Mountain Bike, 2.1"" tire width = 4.8L
29"" Mountain Bike, 2.1"" tire width = 5.2L
700C Road Bike, 35mm tire width = 2L

I'm finding pump specifications quite difficult to find (I need piston diameter and stroke length), but here's a comparison of some shock pumps on an empty shock cylinder of a 2007 Fox 36 RLC 160mm Fork.


Average Accu-Gage Pressure Reading after 100 strokes: 77.2 psi
My best guess at RC2 air chamber specifications: 1"" (25.4mm) diameter, 160mm length (max travel). If someone can find accurate specs or the true volume, I'd appreciate it.
Fox RC2 Air Volume (estimated): Vcylinder = pi*r^2*h = 81 mL


So then, IF pumping air into different volumes is linearly proportional (it's not, but somewhere in the ball park), and you wanted to inflate the tires listed above to ~77.2psi, it'd take about this number of pumps with the 'average' shock pump:

You twist the handle to select between uses, and save yourself a few thousand pumps.

3603,3603,5751,Words for meat differ from the words for the corresponding animal,"In English we have:


""beef"" for ""cow"", ""cattle""

""pork"" for ""pig""

I'm not aware of this separation for ""fish"", ""goat"" or ""chicken"" (Spanish has ""pollo"" and ""gallina"") and other poultry. Are these words used simply to distinguish the meat from the animal (i.e. to avoid saying ""cow meat"") or is there a psychological separation to avoid the association? I doubt the latter since these words developed when people were likely less squeamish than some are today. 

Why are there not meat words for some animals? 

What are some others I didn't list?

Is this a limitation of RPi? Or a problem with this specific Hard Drive?

update: solved the issue with help of the commentators here...

here is what I did ...


I thought I have some weired issue with Debian Wheezy &amp; gparted. So, I reformatted the hard drive to NTFS. Before that I ERASED the partition table. 
And created a new single NTFS partition. 
Bingo! RPi, identified the partition. However, it claimed my Drive is now 2TB big, and recommended I will use GPT:

whoops! That is WRONG!

So, I disconnected the hard drive again. re-connented it to my laptop. I erased the partition table again, and re-created the partition table using fdisk on RPi! not on my laptop! This time, I took a short cut, and created the disk partition with ext4 directly. 
    I plugged the hard-drive to RPi and BINGO!

conclusion (?)

My guess is that gparted in Debian Wheezy includes some nasty bug which is sometimes showing it's ugly face. I would report a bug if I had more solid evidence. But ... since I have only one 500GB hard drive, and I don't want to
risk the health of this hard drive reformatting it so many time, I will settle this with it. If you happen to bump into this post, and you have had similar problems with large SATA drives and partitioning on wheezy, I would be happy to know.
",Oz123,https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/users/3505,"Basically instead of fdisk -l, you should use parted -l (install parted if you do not have it installed) to see the actual data partition and then mount the actual data partition (/dev/sdb2, etc) directly.

I wrote a short tutorial on how to do this:

http://www.zayblog.com/computer-and-it/2013/07/22/mounting-gpt-partitions-on-raspberry-pi/

I was able to mount 2 8TB partitions directly, without wiping the data/reformat the drive.

whoops! That is WRONG!

So, I disconnected the hard drive again. re-connented it to my laptop. I erased the partition table again, and re-created the partition table using fdisk on RPi! not on my laptop! This time, I took a short cut, and created the disk partition with ext4 directly. 
    I plugged the hard-drive to RPi and BINGO!

conclusion (?)

My guess is that gparted in Debian Wheezy includes some nasty bug which is sometimes showing it's ugly face. I would report a bug if I had more solid evidence. But ... since I have only one 500GB hard drive, and I don't want to
risk the health of this hard drive reformatting it so many time, I will settle this with it. If you happen to bump into this post, and you have had similar problems with large SATA drives and partitioning on wheezy, I would be happy to know.
","Basically instead of fdisk -l, you should use parted -l (install parted if you do not have it installed) to see the actual data partition and then mount the actual data partition (/dev/sdb2, etc) directly.

I wrote a short tutorial on how to do this:

http://www.zayblog.com/computer-and-it/2013/07/22/mounting-gpt-partitions-on-raspberry-pi/

I was able to mount 2 8TB partitions directly, without wiping the data/reformat the drive.

dx[t_] := Piecewise[{{0, y[t] &lt;= 0}, {x[t]^(3/4) - x[t], y[t] &gt; 0}}]
dy[t_] := Piecewise[{{0, y[t] &lt;= 0}, {(1 - y[t])/x[t]^(1/4) + y[t], y[t] &gt; 0}}]

NDSolve[{x'[t] == dx[t], y'[t] == dy[t], x[0] == 1, y[10] == 2}, {x, y}, {t, 0, 10}]


which produces the error

 NDSolve::bvdisc: NDSolve is not currently able to solve boundary value problems with discrete variables.


I tried the answers here by entering

funs = ParametricNDSolveValue[{x'[t] == dx[t], y'[t] == dy[t], x[0] == 1, y[10] == yt}, {x, y}, {t, 0, end}, yt]

FindRoot[funs[yt][end], {yt, 2}]


which yields the same error.

Is there any way to solve this system? Thanks for the help.
",Mauricio,https://mathematica.stackexchange.com/users/19635,"There is no need to use Piecewise because both $x(t)$ as well as $y(t)$ remain non negative.

Finally we verify our first statement about the non-negativity.

Ok, here we go.

The eqution for $x(t)$ is

sx = DSolve[x'[t] == x[t]^(3/4) - x[t] &amp;&amp; x[0] == 1, x[t], t]


We can safely ignore the error messages; they are just information which is not relevant here.

Now solving numerically the equation for $y(t)$ using the previously obtained function $xx(t)$:

Works out smoothly, no precision problems.
Here's the function itself

yy[t_] = y[t] /. sy

Finally ploting both functions together, magnifying $x(t)$ by a factor of ten for better visibility:

1184,1184,1860,"How should I take a potential PhD supervisor's age into account, when planning to follow PhD with habilitation?","I plan to apply for PhD in Finance/Statistics next semester, and hence searched for potential supervisors.

An issue I have is that many interesting candidates are above age 60, and in Germany Professors retire at 65, such that a subsequent post-doc/habilitation would most likely require a different supervisor after PhD. One Professor just started his position at age 40, but so he has not many notable publications and I am unsure whether he might change university soon (he just changed it from another 4 years position).

Could someone advise me on the importance of age for selecting a PhD supervisor in context of a long-term future academic career?

The time for PhD would be 4-5 years, and PostDoc/Habilitation/AssociateProf usually again 4-6 years, with goal of potentially becoming Full Professor in Finance/Statistics.

So I would say you demonstrate good long-term thinking. Already thinking about your academic career will help you prepare to work out a research program, network (more on this below) etc.

Second: there is no problem whatsoever with changing advisors between the Ph.D. and the postdoc period. To the contrary! If you stay at the same place for almost ten years, you will need to explain why you never moved, never checked out other places to work, other approaches to research.

You may just meet someone at your first conference who you could collaborate with or spend your postdoc time with.

So I would definitely recommend that you consider the older potential advisor. He sounds like he could introduce you to lots of people, and you will likely not need to pack up and move somewhere else during your Ph.D. period, which seems possible with the younger professor and which could somewhat mess up your personal life.

4) Draw map using SVG.

Requirments are supporting pathfinding and gps navigation.

For first 2 ways I think that it's expensive in terms of performance way, redraw all elements on scaling; and I don't think that this way may have GPS-navigation support.

Using AutoCad pictured maps is hard to understand for me how to connect it with graphs\paths for pathfinding.

",Aft3rmath,https://stackoverflow.com/users/1286212,"Generally there are two types of map application:

A) They display a map, (with or without  a user position) without needing to calculate a path like a navigation system does (see point B)

B) Application that use the vectors of a map and calculate something: e.g to find a best path. The shortest connection, e.g A navighation system , etc.

Application for A) are usually less complex then that of B), because the vectors can be somewhat inacurate, have no conections, have small gaps, have no logic between the edges, etc. 

1) To only display a building map, you would only need a list of edges. (An edge is pair of coordinates (x1,y1) - (x2,y2). How ever you get that. E.g MapInfo Professional format mif/mid. 
Or even you could dispaly a pdf that contains the map of the builing. Right with the built in PDF View, (also with SVG but more difficult). 

Things get much more complicated if it is not a relative map, but also a map that is positioned with an reference coordinate system, like latitude/longitude (WGS84).
In that case you would use a Tool (mapInfoProfessional, to import AutoCad DXF Files, and apply 3 GPS measured reference points at the corner of the house, and convert that to LatLong WGS84 coordinates system.
With ios you cannot measure that 3 Points because you cannot average a position,  ios stops sending when you are standing still at one corner of the house.
You could try to extract the positions from a google earth satellite foto if you are living in a region where google Sattelite fotos have high resolution. (But  this might violate the license conditions of that Satellite Foto provider (Topic: derived data))

Finally you now have a list of edges in Lat Lon coordinate System.

For Displaying I personally would either do with 1) OpenGL) or 2) Quartz2D.

Now the Path finding part.

Probaly you need a second ""map"" that defines the possible paths inside the building.
This structure must be a connect graph (points with connected neighbours).
Computer games do it that way. (Some even allow you to display that path in developper  mode)

The path can be drawn, in a different layer of the floor plan. But  this path
 has higher requirements: No gaps are allowed, all must be perfect connected.

Call that layer ""Path"" and export it as own plan.
Now use only this path layer, and import, and create a graph of nodes with connect neighbours.

Use Dijkstra Algo to search for shortest path.

Things get much more complicated if it is not a relative map, but also a map that is positioned with an reference coordinate system, like latitude/longitude (WGS84).
In that case you would use a Tool (mapInfoProfessional, to import AutoCad DXF Files, and apply 3 GPS measured reference points at the corner of the house, and convert that to LatLong WGS84 coordinates system.
With ios you cannot measure that 3 Points because you cannot average a position,  ios stops sending when you are standing still at one corner of the house.
You could try to extract the positions from a google earth satellite foto if you are living in a region where google Sattelite fotos have high resolution. (But  this might violate the license conditions of that Satellite Foto provider (Topic: derived data))

Finally you now have a list of edges in Lat Lon coordinate System.

For Displaying I personally would either do with 1) OpenGL) or 2) Quartz2D.

Now the Path finding part.

Probaly you need a second ""map"" that defines the possible paths inside the building.
This structure must be a connect graph (points with connected neighbours).
Computer games do it that way. (Some even allow you to display that path in developper  mode)

The path can be drawn, in a different layer of the floor plan. But  this path
 has higher requirements: No gaps are allowed, all must be perfect connected.

Call that layer ""Path"" and export it as own plan.
Now use only this path layer, and import, and create a graph of nodes with connect neighbours.

Use Dijkstra Algo to search for shortest path.

2561,2561,4076,Didn't Say Uno Before Running Out of Cards,"So my family is having a disagreement on the uno rules. Here's what happened:

Player 1 completes turn by playing a regular numbered blue card

Player 2 has 3 cards left. Player 2 plays a blue skip, and plays a red skip. Player 2 has 1 card now. Player 2 plays their last card (a red numbered card). 

They are out of cards, having played 3 cards really close together, with no chance for Player 1 to call them out on not saying uno. Player 1 calls it right after Player 2 has already run out of cards.

Here's the question - Player 2 is already out of cards, and never said Uno, and now Player 1 is calling them out on it. Has player 2 already won, or must Player 2 now take 2 cards?
",James T,https://boardgames.stackexchange.com/users/11745,"From the rules, the hand is over. 

http://www.wonkavator.com/uno/unorules.html


  When you have one card left, you must yell ""UNO"" (meaning one).
  Failure to do this results in you having to pick two cards from the
  DRAW pile. That is, of course if you get caught by the other players.
  Once a player has no cards left, the hand is over. Points are scored
  (see scoring section) and you start over again. That's UNO in a
  nutshell.


Further, you only have until the next player starts playing a card before it is to late to call them out. In this scenario once Player 2 started his 3rd turn (by starting the motion to play his last card), it was too late to call him out.


  A player who forgets to say UNO before his card touches the discard
  pile, but ""catches"" himself before any other player catches him, is
  safe and is not subject to the penalty. You may not catch a player for
  failure to say UNO until his second to last card touches the DISCARD
  pile. Also, you may not catch a player for failure to say UNO after

  cards are counted when points are totaled. If no one is out of cards
  by the time the DRAW pile is depleted, reshuffle and continue play.

The two lenses you indicate are really fairly different; the 80-200 is a fast lens (f/2.8), while the 18-200 is quite a bit slower.  You'd be giving up a lot of optical performance to get that extra range, which is why most people end up covering this range with two lenses, more or less.

""beef"" for ""cow"", ""cattle""

I'm not aware of this separation for ""fish"", ""goat"" or ""chicken"" (Spanish has ""pollo"" and ""gallina"") and other poultry. Are these words used simply to distinguish the meat from the animal (i.e. to avoid saying ""cow meat"") or is there a psychological separation to avoid the association?

352,352,559,XSLT Sort with variable select,"I have a HTML select dropdown:

                &lt;select name=""sortby""&gt;

                &lt;/select&gt;


When the user submits this it sends a URL query string to the page and it gets added to the XML of the page:

&lt;querystring&gt;
 &lt;sortby&gt;number_bathrooms&lt;/sortby&gt;
&lt;/querystring&gt;


I then set an XSL variable in my XSLT: 

        &lt;xsl:variable name=""sortby""&gt;
            &lt;xsl:choose&gt;
                &lt;xsl:when test=""/querystring/sortby != ''""&gt;
                    &lt;xsl:value-of select=""/querystring/sortby"" /&gt;

            &lt;/xsl:choose&gt;
        &lt;/xsl:variable&gt;


In the above XST I am setting a variable called $sortby and testing whether the querystring exists.  If it does exist then set the variable to its value.  If it doesn't exist then default it to ""onenightavg"".

Then I use that variable in my sort:

&lt;xsl:sort data-type=""number"" order=""ascending"" select=""$sortby"" /&gt;


This doesn't work.  It doesn't sort my items, but when I hardcode the select to any one of the values like this it works:

Is the sentence comparing personality of good people and personality of bad people? or comparing personality of good people and bad people?

How to avoid ambiguity when using of with compound nouns?
",zx_wing,https://english.stackexchange.com/users/88615,"As I understand it, your question about the sentence


  This is a main difference between the personality of good people and bad people.


involves determining whether ""the personality of good people"" is being contrasted with ""bad people"" or with ""[the personality of] bad people."" Structurally the sentence permits (with a little logical fudging) either reading, though I suspect that the author intends the second one.

That being the case, the biggest weakness of the sentence as written is that it seems to favor a logical reading that finds the intended contrast to be between ""the personality of good people"" (where ""personality"" is obviously a singular noun) on the one hand and ""bad people"" on the other. We can start to overcome that problem by changing personality to personalities:


  This is a main difference between the personalities of good people and bad people.


At this point, we still have (from a strictly logical reading of the sentence) a contrast between ""the personalities of good people"" on the one hand and ""bad people"" on the other. But beyond that, we have a plausible set of parallels attaching to the stem word of: ""good people"" and ""bad people."" And whereas before that of linked problematically to a singular personality, it now links to the plural personalities—a better platform for the parallelism. And we can strengthen the parallelism of these phrases by adding the word  of before ""bad people"":


  This is a main difference between the personalities of good people and of bad people.


Now the parallel phrases ""of good people"" and ""of bad people"" attach to the stem word personalities—and a reader cannot logically misread the intended contrast as being between ""the personalities of good people"" on the one hand and ""bad people"" on the other, without ignoring the of immediately preceding ""bad people.""

As other answerers and commenters have pointed out, there are alternative ways to make the sentence unambiguously present a contrast between the two types of personalities. For example, you could say


  This is a main difference between the personality of good people and the personality of bad people. 


But the shorter form that I suggest is every bit as clearly parallel and yet (to my mind) somewhat less tedious.

Conversely, if you wanted to establish a contrast between ""bad people"" on the one hand and ""the personality of good people"" on the other, the simplest way to proceed would be to flip their order in your original sentence:


  This is a main difference between bad people and the personality of good people. 


Either way the things that the sentence is seeking to compare are clearly defined, and readers won't be tempted to misread the writer's meaning.



As a side note, I acknowledge that the form ""the personalities of good people and of bad people"" may suggest to some readers that the author is comparing multiple personalities of good people to multiple personalities of bad people, whereas the original wording seems to take the view that good people have one unitary personality and people a very different unitary personality. If this change runs afoul of the author's intentions, we could revise the wording (again) to say something like this:

The IP of the proxy is 85.214.85.193, but on my other computer which was also proxied the IP was something different (I forgot to write it down).
",Bill,https://security.stackexchange.com/users/6615,"This all depends on the proxy itself. A proxy intercepts, and redirects. Everything going towards the Internet was intercepted, but it doesn't mean that all was readable. When you log into certain sites (banks, to buy something) most use SSL which means that, unless the proxy was intercepting with a trusted certificate, most data would be encrypted. If in the event the proxy intercepted SSL, and was capable of forging a certificate, or making you believe a certificate was trusted, then you're data is readable. You would have gotten a certificate error via your browser: ""Warning this site uses an untrusted certificate..."" 

Can you elaborate more on the proxy server. E.g. the IP (if possible). Some ISPs use proxies (rare) to cache and provide content quicker.

ADDED

The IP space belongs to Strato in Germany http://bgp.he.net/net/85.214.0.0/15#_whois and is listed in a lot of ""free proxy"" like sites. The bigger question for you is, how did your machine manage to get proxied in the first place. This is likely caused by some form of malware that made its way onto your machine if you did not configure that proxy. As noted, SSL could have been stripped so that is something to take into consideration.

Personally, I would try and determine how my machine got compromised, I would clean it up, preferably re-install from a clean source, then go and change all my passwords AFTER the fact I cleaned up. (Makes no sense to type much via way of credentials when you don't know what's on your machine)

A proxy intercepts, and redirects. Everything going towards the Internet was intercepted, but it doesn't mean that all was readable. When you log into certain sites (banks, to buy something) most use SSL which means that, unless the proxy was intercepting with a trusted certificate, most data would be encrypted. If in the event the proxy intercepted SSL, and was capable of forging a certificate, or making you believe a certificate was trusted, then you're data is readable. You would have gotten a certificate error via your browser: ""Warning this site uses an untrusted certificate..."" 

Can you elaborate more on the proxy server. E.g. the IP (if possible). Some ISPs use proxies (rare) to cache and provide content quicker.

ADDED

The IP space belongs to Strato in Germany http://bgp.he.net/net/85.214.0.0/15#_whois and is listed in a lot of ""free proxy"" like sites. The bigger question for you is, how did your machine manage to get proxied in the first place. This is likely caused by some form of malware that made its way onto your machine if you did not configure that proxy. As noted, SSL could have been stripped so that is something to take into consideration.

Personally, I would try and determine how my machine got compromised, I would clean it up, preferably re-install from a clean source, then go and change all my passwords AFTER the fact I cleaned up. (Makes no sense to type much via way of credentials when you don't know what's on your machine)

My opinion is that better frame quality only is possible with better techniques or when other settings are used. I think it can’t be because of only a frame increasement. It’s true that more frames per second makes new techniques available.

But why do they think that the screen quality is better? Is it maybe because of a higher resolution? Or do they just use other settings?
",Laurence,https://movies.stackexchange.com/users/3733,"There is a huge difference in the feeling of the film based upon the Frames Per Second it was shot in.

There are a number of films that were shot using a digital camera, but at a higher 30FPS that were reviewed to have a ""poor quality or feel"" because the faster shutter rate gave it a television feeling.

Many professional digital camera now shoot at the slower 24FPS to capture that film feeling.

Many faster 30FPS digital cameras often produced a cleaner, sharper, wider range of color image that was perceived to be to different from traditional film stock. That the color space and feel of film could not be reproduced digitally. Much of this is true.

Today, many digital cameras now use all the same lens, hardware and mounts that older traditional film cameras used. The sensors are much more refined and adjusted to give a more natural color space. Post-processing has also greatly improved to reproduce many film stocks as a digital filter.

If you were speaking to someone who was not technical, but experienced in the film industry. He may have experienced producing films at 30FPS which were much sharper and cleaner then traditional 24FPS film stock. As a result. I can totally understand his perspective that 30FPS has a higher quality image.

The techniques to produce 30FPS and 24FPS films at one time was very different. Today, it's better to clarify that the difference is not frame rate, but film versus digital.

Additionally, frames per second can have a direct impact on the type of motion blur produced in an image. The higher the frame rate the less motion blur there is. Resulting in a cleaner sharper image for objects in motion.

There are a number of films that were shot using a digital camera, but at a higher 30FPS that were reviewed to have a ""poor quality or feel"" because the faster shutter rate gave it a television feeling.

Many professional digital camera now shoot at the slower 24FPS to capture that film feeling.

Many faster 30FPS digital cameras often produced a cleaner, sharper, wider range of color image that was perceived to be to different from traditional film stock. That the color space and feel of film could not be reproduced digitally. Much of this is true.

Today, many digital cameras now use all the same lens, hardware and mounts that older traditional film cameras used. The sensors are much more refined and adjusted to give a more natural color space. Post-processing has also greatly improved to reproduce many film stocks as a digital filter.

If you were speaking to someone who was not technical, but experienced in the film industry. He may have experienced producing films at 30FPS which were much sharper and cleaner then traditional 24FPS film stock. As a result. I can totally understand his perspective that 30FPS has a higher quality image.

The techniques to produce 30FPS and 24FPS films at one time was very different. Today, it's better to clarify that the difference is not frame rate, but film versus digital.

Additionally, frames per second can have a direct impact on the type of motion blur produced in an image. The higher the frame rate the less motion blur there is. Resulting in a cleaner sharper image for objects in motion.

407,407,633,Battery Drains Every 1-3 Weeks,"I have been experiencing a slow draining of the battery for the past 1-2 months wherein the vehicle will be fine and suddenly the vehicle will not start.  

First thought was the battery, as the vehicle has about 90000 on it.  I could have tested it, but didn't; just bought another one thinking it would save the trouble soon enough if it wasn't the battery.  On installing the battery, I checked for the usual: lights left on, doors left open, etc.  But there was nothing out of the ordinary.

Two weeks later, the new battery drained. I charged up the old one swapped it in.  One week later, that one was drained.  

Determined now that it was not the battery, I searched high and low for some good tests.  I did a ground test (all less than 2-1ohm), point to point resistance check(all 1-2ohm), parasitic draw test (30mA after entering sleep mode), and charging voltage test.  Everything looked satisfactory.  The only thing that I noticed was, if I left the nominal voltage charging test run, for minutes, I would slowly watch the voltage creep down.  After twenty minutes I was seeing 13.8V after starting at 14.3V (measured across the battery terminals).  I ran out of time to swap out the battery on my multimeter (thinking this might be the culprit), so it could just be that.  But, I'm curious.  Does a slow fall of the charging voltage (across the battery terminals) indicate an alternator problem?  Belt tensioner problem?  Looking for thoughts on this slow decline in charging voltage across the battery to determine where to dig into next.  I didn't see how low it could go, but if the community thinks it's worth a shot, I'll do it (even if it means an hour to find it).

The vehicle:  '08 Nissan Rogue,  AWD. 90k miles.  
",N8sBug,https://mechanics.stackexchange.com/users/6216,"I would place this as being an issue with the alternator.

5143,5143,8176,Extracting useful information from free text,"We filter and analyse seats for events.  Apparently writing a domain query language for the floor people isn't an option.  I'm using C# 4.0 &amp; .NET 4.0, and have relatively free reign to use whatever open-source tools are available.  &lt;/background-info&gt;

If a request comes in for ""FLOOR B"", the sales people want it to show up if they've entered ""FLOOR A-FLOOR F"" in a filter.  The only problem I have is that there's absolutely no structure to the parsed parameters.  I get the string already concatenated (it actually uses a tilde instead of dash).  Examples I've seen so far with matches after each:


101WC-199WC  (needs to match 150WC)
AAA-ZZZ   (needs to match AAA, BBB, ABC but not BB)
LOGE15-LOGE20  (needs to match LOGE15 but not LOGE150)


At first I wanted to try just stripping off the numeric part of the lower and upper, and then incrementing through that.  The problem I have is that only some entries have numbers, sometimes the numbers AND letters increment, sometimes its all letters that increment.  Since I can't impose any kind of grammar to use (I really wanted [..] expansion syntax), I'm stuck using these entries.

Are there any suggestions for how to approach this parsing problem?
",Bryan Boettcher,https://programmers.stackexchange.com/users/17309,"The only pattern I can see is that you have either letters followed by digits, or digits followed by letters, or letters only.

From this point, the first step would be to separate the string into the beginning and the end, then to separate each part into a group of one or two entities:

""AB12-ZZ789"" → [""AB12"", ""ZZ789""] → [[""AB"", ""12""], [""ZZ"", ""789""]]


The numeric entities can be then converted to numbers:

[[""AB"", ""12""], [""ZZ"", ""789""]] → [[""AB"", 12], [""ZZ"", 789]]


Then, letters can be converted to their respective numeric representation. For example, if ""A"" is mapped to 0, ""B"" - to 1, etc., ""AB"" is 0 × 26 + 1, while ""ZZ"" is 25 × 26 + 25.

[[""AB"", 12], [""ZZ"", 789]] → [[26, 12], [675, 789]]


Once you do this conversion, it's pretty simple to know if the value is in a range. For example,

""HC52"" → [""HC"", ""52""]
       → [""HC"", 52]
       → [(7 × 26 + 2), 52]
       → [184, 52]


26 ≤ 184 ≤ 675 and 12 ≤ 52 ≤ 789, so the value is in the range.

""HC999"" → [""HC"", ""999""]
        → [""HC"", 999]
        → [(7 × 26 + 2), 999]

686,686,1083,What should I look for in a recording microphone for personal use?,"I was browsing through mics on Amazon and quickly realized I was out of my depth.  There are a couple closely related questions I am wondering about:


Are there different types of mics for (1) singing into at a concert, (2) singing into in a quiet room, and (3) picking up sound at more of a distance (e.g., singing and playing guitar and having both recorded with the one mic)?  What are they?
I'm most interested in a mic for case (3).  This is obviously not professional, I just want something with passable quality and not too much noise considering I'll be in a random room in a house or apartment.  What kind of things should I look for in a mic to achieve that?  What are the factors that most depend on price?  (If it's feasible I'd like to try to fit it into my $50 contest reward.)
There are a few terms I saw like ""moving coil"", ""condenser"", and ""dynamic"" that I saw used to describe mics.  If you could touch on these and any other relevant terminology that would be awesome.

",Matthew Read,https://music.stackexchange.com/users/28,"Great question.  What all this really boils down to is the polar pattern or pickup pattern of the microphone.  Some mics will pick up more sound from the front and less from the sides and rear.  Mics that are extremely directional are good for rejecting the loud drums behind you and also rejecting the sound from a PA speaker that might be right in front of you.  Many handheld mics have this type of cardioid or supercardioid pattern.  Other specialty mics have different patterns that may pick up from all around or just from the front or back.  These may be options for you, but won't be as flexible in the long run.  

Once you decide on a pickup pattern for your needs, you can start looking at the mechanics of how the mic works - condenser, dynamic, ribbon ... all that stuff.  You could stick a dynamic in front of you and your guitar and end up with a passable result.  Personally, I'd go for a large diaphragm condenser since they seem to pick up a bit more of the bass and give a nice sound in a solo context.  The range of choices is dizzying, so nail down a price range and pick one based on reviews and whatever else matters to you.  More expensive mics have higher quality components that will produce a better sound.  Audio equipment gets expensive fast and there's not much payoff over a certain level.  You also have to think about WHERE you are recording, as room acoustics can 'cheapen' your sound.

You need to have something to plug this microphone into - typically called a preamplifier or preamp.  These are built into mixers, computer audio interfaces or stand alone units.  A shure 57 or 58 can really shine with a good preamp.  If you plug it into a low quality preamp, you'll get a low signal, a noisy signal or a quiet/noisy signal - yuck.  If you have a condenser microphone, the preamp will need phantom power in order for the microphone to work.

Some other ideas for you...

Another option might be a hand held recorder which can be carted around, run off battery power and then transferred to your computer for editing and distribution.  Super easy and cheap.  And you don't need a computer with you - which is always nice.  Other options are recording with a phone using some kind of USB microphone.

Unicast is used when two network nodes need to talk to each other. This is pretty straight forward, so I'm not going to spend much time on it. TCP by definition is a Unicast protocol, except when there is Anycast involved (more on that below).

When you need to have more than two nodes see the traffic, you have options. 

If all of the nodes are on the same subnet, then broadcast becomes a viable solution. All nodes on the subnet will see all traffic. There is no TCP-like connection state maintained. Broadcast is a layer 2 feature in the Ethernet protocol, and also a layer 3 feature in IPv4.

Multicast is like a broadcast that can cross subnets, but unlike broadcast does not touch all nodes. Nodes have to subscribe to a multicast group to receive information. Multicast protocols are usually UDP protocols, since by definition no connection-state can be maintained. Nodes transmitting data to a multicast group do not know what nodes are receiving. By default, Internet routers do not pass Multicast traffic. For internal use, though, it is perfectly allowed; thus, ""Defined horizon"" in the above chart. Multicast is a layer 3 feature of IPv4 &amp; IPv6.

To use anycast you advertise the same network in multiple spots of the Internet, and rely on shortest-path calculations to funnel clients to your multiple locations. As far the network nodes themselves are concerned, they're using a unicast connection to talk to your anycasted nodes. For more on Anycast, try: What is &quot;anycast&quot; and how is it helpful?. Anycast is also a layer 3 feature, but is a function of how route-coalescing happens.



Examples

Some examples of how the non-Unicast methods are used in the real Internet.

BroadcastARP is a broadcast protocol, and is used by TCP/IP stacks to determine how to send traffic to other nodes on the network. If the destination is on the same subnet, ARP is used to figure out the MAC address that goes to the stated IP address. This is a Level 2 (Ethernet) broadcast, to the reserved FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF MAC address.

Also, Microsoft's machine browsing protocol is famously broadcast based. Work-arounds like WINS were created to allow cross-subnet browsing. This involves a Level 3 (IP) broadcast, which is an IP packet with the Destination address listed as the broadcast address of the subnet (in 192.168.101.0/24, the broadcast address would be 192.168.101.255).

The NTP protocol allows a broadcast method for announcing time sources.

MulticastInside a corporate network, Multicast can deliver live video to multiple nodes without having to have massive bandwidth on the part of the server delivering the video feed. This way you can have a video server feeding a 720p stream on only a 100Mb connection, and yet still serve that feed to 3000 clients. 

When Novell moved away from IPX and to IP, they had to pick a service-advertising protocol to replace the SAP protocol in IPX. In IPX, the Service Advertising Protocol, did a network-wide announcement every time it announced a service was available. As TCP/IP lacked such a global announcement protocol, Novell chose to use a Multicast based protocol instead: the Service Location Protocol. New servers announce their services on the SLP multicast group. Clients looking for specific types of services announce their need to the multicast group and listen for unicasted replies. 

HP printers announce their presence on a multicast group by default. With the right tools, it makes it real easy to learn what printers are available on your network.

The NTP protocol also allows a multicast method (IP 224.0.1.1) for announcing time sources to areas beyond just the one subnet. 

Anycast
Anycast is a bit special since Unicast layers on top of it. Anycast is announcing the same network in different parts of the network, in order to decrease the network hops needed to get to that network. 

The 6to4 IPv6 transition protocol uses Anycast. 6to4 gateways announce their presence on a specific IP, 192.88.99.1. Clients looking to use a 6to4 gateway send traffic to 192.88.99.1 and trust the network to deliver the connection request to a 6to4 router.

NTP services for especially popular NTP hosts may very well be anycasted, but I don't have proof of this. There is nothing in the protocol to prevent it.

Other services use Anycast to improve data locality to end users. Google does Anycast with its search pages in some places (and geo-IP in others). The Root DNS servers use Anycast for similar reasons. ServerFault itself just might go there, they do have datacenters in New York and Oregon, but hasn't gone there yet.



Network concerns

Excessive broadcast traffic can rob all nodes in that subnet of bandwidth. This is less of a concern these days with full-duplex GigE ports, but back in the half-duplex 10Mb days a broadcast storm could bring a network to a halt real fast. Those half-duplex networks with one big collision domain across all nodes were especially vulnerable to broadcast storms, which is why networking books, especially older ones, say to keep an eye on broadcast traffic. Switched/Full-Duplex networks are a lot harder to bring to a halt with a broadcast storm, but it can still happen. Broadcast is required for correct functioning of IP networks. 

Multicast has the same possibility for abuse. If one node on the multicast group starts sending huge amounts of traffic to that group, all subscribed nodes will see all of that traffic. As with broadcast, excessive Mcast traffic can increase the possibilities of collisions on such connections where that is a problem. 

Multicast is an optional feature with IPv4, but required for IPv6. The IPv4 broadcast is replaced by multicast in IPv6 (See also: Why can&#39;t IPv6 send broadcasts?). It is frequently turned off on IPv4 networks. Not coincidentally, enabling multicast is one of the many reasons network-engineers are leery of moving to IPv6 before they have to do it.

Calculating how much traffic is too much traffic depends on a few things


Half vs Full Duplex: Half-duplex networks have much lower tolerances for bcast/mcast traffic.
Speed of network ports: The faster your network, the less of an issue this becomes. In the 10Mb ethernet days 5-10% of traffic on a port could be bcast traffic, if not more, but on GigE less than 1% (probably way less) is more likely. 
Number of nodes on the network: The more nodes you have, the more unavoidable broadcast traffic you'll incur (ARP). If you have broadcast specific protocols in use, Windows browsing or other things like cluster heartbeats, where problems start will change. 
Network technology: Wired Ethernet is fast enough that so long as you have modern gear driving it, bcast/mcast isn't likely to cause you problems. Wireless, on the other hand, can suffer from excessive broadcast traffic as it is a shared medium amongst all nodes and therefore in a single collision domain.


In the end, Bcast and Mcast traffic rob ports of bandwidth off the top. When you start to worry is highly dependent on your individual network and tolerance for variable performance. In general, network-node counts haven't scaled as fast as network speeds so the overall broadcast percentage-as-traffic number has been dropping over time. 

Some networks disallow Multicast for specific reasons, and others have never taken the time to set it up. There are some multicast protocols that can reveal interesting information (SLP is one such) to anyone listening for the right things. Personally, I don't mind minor multicast traffic as the biggest annoyance I've seen with it is polluted network captures when I'm doing some network analysis; and for that there are filters.

I remember reading an article on the difference between ""Launching the lifeboat may have saved lives"" and ""Launching the lifeboat might have saved lives"" but I can't remember where so that doesn't help much as a reference.

Nohat: I would say may/might + perfective (have) has a different meaning than the “concession” meaning here. “Launching the lifeboat may have saved lives” implies the lifeboat was launched, whereas “… might have saved lives” implies it wasn’t launched.

==============

I'm not completely sure of how things operate here at Stack Exchange. I'm not trying to step on anyone's toes, nor am I trying to be mean or snide. I don't know if this is the ""proper"" manner of addressing this. It seems to me that Comments is meant for just that, a short comment. 

This, to my mind, requires much more discussion, [and I hope it doesn't end here. Is there not a venue for advanced discussion?], hence more needed space so I've opted for a  Your Answer. And I believe my comments are directed to answering the question.

With respect, there's no way we can make the assumption that there is a ""rule"" that will describe for all situations/scenarios that launching or not launching a lifeboat [or similar situation] may or may not or might or might not have saved lives or told or implied to us whether or not a lifeboat was launched.

There are scenarios where both 'may' and 'might' are used with their normal epistemic [level of certainty] meanings to speculate on past time events just as they are used to speculate on future or present condition events.

Let me create a scenario. This is a time before ship to shore radios, radar, etc. were available.

A ferry is about to leave port. A person on the dock remarks, ""That boat might sink"". That is based on their personal feeling according to whatever facts, feelings, superstitions that person holds that has influenced their choice of 'might'.

A worker who has been involved in maintaining the ferry says, ""I warned my superiors. That ferry may sink"". 

The owner says, ""That ferry will never sink"" [Where have we heard that before?]

A foreman says in a suicide note, ""I have to address this, ... to set the record straight. We did our best but the owners wanted to save money. That ferry probably will go down on this trip.""

Other people, for whatever personal reasons they have, even a premonition, could choose, ""The ferry will almost certainly sink"" / ""The ferry may well/might well sink"".

The wide variation, which ranges from zero percent chance [owner] to say, a old time ""terrorist"" who has made some effort to sink the boat, conjecturing ""That ferry will go down"", does not mean that anyone of them is right before the boat leaves port.

That's what modals allow us to do, speculate on events, conjecture, and it doesn't matter if the event is past, present or future.

There is a terrible storm, the ferry is overdue. Those same people, probably now joined by countless others, all weigh in with their OPINIONS because, they have nothing else to go on. Remember, this is a time before radios, radar, etc.

1)The ferry went down.

2) The ferry must have sunk.

3) The ferry probably/likely sank.

4) The ferry may have gone down.

5) The ferry might have gone down.

6) The ferry didn't sink.

Again, at this point, with the available information, all are opinions, even 1) and 6), though one of them will, maybe, probably never, eventually be confirmed as fact.

But look at the modal perfect examples for that's the point I'm trying to get across. Sometimes, 'might' just means what it most often normally means, ""there's a tiny to small chance that X will occur/is occurring/has occurred"".

The ferry, I'm sad to report, [this is my scenario] went down. The people of that time only know this because no trace was ever found of the boat, the people or the things on the boat. No lifeboats were ever launched.

There is now rampant speculation among the population on whether a or some lifeboats would have saved lives.    

1) Lifeboats would have saved lives.

2) Lifeboats almost certainly would have saved lives.

[Note that 'must have saved lives', epistemically equal to 'almost certainly would have saved lives' isn't possible here]

3) Lifeboats probably/likely would have saved lives.

[Note that 'should have saved lives', is strange here even though 'should' is epistemically equal to 'probably/likely'.]

4) Lifeboats may have saved lives.

5) Lifeboats might have saved lives.

6) Lifeboats wouldn't have saved lives.

But all these are still simply personal opinions, not statements of fact.

Look at the 'may have' and 'might have' parts. There's no implication in the 'might have saved lives' opinion that lifeboats were launched. There's a fact that dismisses any such implication. No lifeboats were launched.

Certainly, there are situations where 'might' and 'may are used to effect a meaning other that their basic epistemic/level of certainty meanings. I noted this with respect to 'might' in my previous post.

We know that there are meanings for 'may' and for 'might' that are sometimes used to make a concession and sometimes, to angrily suggest [sometimes using understatement] that something should have been done. 

For this scenario, ""You might have [at the very least] sent out one search boat!"" 

What nohat stated was true, but it's not true for all situations, not even for most; I'd say that its true for a small portion of 'might have + PP' situations. 

I'm sorry that this is so long, but if you'll bear with me. I've read often this idea presented by nohat. It is similar in nature to the thought used to prohibit ""If S was"" as a counterfactual use. 

Somebody, sometime, noticed that ""If S was"" can hold the meaning of ""allowing that that is true, ... "", so they errantly made a determination that that excluded the counterfactual 'was' use in ""If I was you, ... "". 

Language is exceedingly complex and these kinds of expansive notions aren't helpful to come to an understanding of language. They have no affect on native speakers, save for the fact that the myths continue to be spread, but they have a gigantic affect on ESL/EFLs, both in terms of comprehension and production.

Another of these expansive notions is the idea that 'would' is subjunctive. It is not! There are only a few examples of the subjunctive left in English and 'would' is not one of them.

'would' can be, and is often used in subjunctive uses to express subjunctive/contrary to fact ideas, but so are a lot of other modals.

'would' also hold the meaning of 100% true, ""that would be Bill""; ""He would, ten years later, be elected president"". 

The original question, which I'm now pointedly getting to, [how does one illustrate a degree of embarrassment?]

My parents would have walked along the Barrow

likely, in my opinion, shows this same meaning of 'would', ie. 100% true. I may be wrong for this particular instance but that doesn't negate the fact that that is how 'would' is often used. 


  Cindi noted: I think the intention is
  to evoke the event rather than just

Cindi and I disagree. She has an opinion on how 'would' is being used here that differs from my opinion. She may well be right. The speaker could be using 'would have' in the same sense as 'must have', which would express some degree of doubt.

The mistaken notion that 'would' is always subjunctive/shows doubt cause these kinds of misunderstanding. I suspect that the person who asked the original question is a native speaker - I could be wrong here too but nevertheless, the answers, I feel, illustrate just how strong this notion is set even in the conscious ideas of native speakers. 

It's interesting to note, please do, that this notion doesn't exist in our personal natural grammars because we all use this idea of 'would' as 100% true in so many instances, without it twigging whatever conscious prescriptions we hold.

I remember reading an article on the difference between ""Launching the lifeboat may have saved lives"" and ""Launching the lifeboat might have saved lives"" but I can't remember where so that doesn't help much as a reference.

Nohat: I would say may/might + perfective (have) has a different meaning than the “concession” meaning here. “Launching the lifeboat may have saved lives” implies the lifeboat was launched, whereas “… might have saved lives” implies it wasn’t launched.

==============

I'm not completely sure of how things operate here at Stack Exchange. I'm not trying to step on anyone's toes, nor am I trying to be mean or snide. I don't know if this is the ""proper"" manner of addressing this. It seems to me that Comments is meant for just that, a short comment. 

This, to my mind, requires much more discussion, [and I hope it doesn't end here. Is there not a venue for advanced discussion?], hence more needed space so I've opted for a  Your Answer. And I believe my comments are directed to answering the question.

With respect, there's no way we can make the assumption that there is a ""rule"" that will describe for all situations/scenarios that launching or not launching a lifeboat [or similar situation] may or may not or might or might not have saved lives or told or implied to us whether or not a lifeboat was launched.

There are scenarios where both 'may' and 'might' are used with their normal epistemic [level of certainty] meanings to speculate on past time events just as they are used to speculate on future or present condition events.

Let me create a scenario. This is a time before ship to shore radios, radar, etc. were available.

A ferry is about to leave port. A person on the dock remarks, ""That boat might sink"". That is based on their personal feeling according to whatever facts, feelings, superstitions that person holds that has influenced their choice of 'might'.

A worker who has been involved in maintaining the ferry says, ""I warned my superiors. That ferry may sink"". 

The owner says, ""That ferry will never sink"" [Where have we heard that before?]

A foreman says in a suicide note, ""I have to address this, ... to set the record straight. We did our best but the owners wanted to save money. That ferry probably will go down on this trip.""

Other people, for whatever personal reasons they have, even a premonition, could choose, ""The ferry will almost certainly sink"" / ""The ferry may well/might well sink"".

The wide variation, which ranges from zero percent chance [owner] to say, a old time ""terrorist"" who has made some effort to sink the boat, conjecturing ""That ferry will go down"", does not mean that anyone of them is right before the boat leaves port.

That's what modals allow us to do, speculate on events, conjecture, and it doesn't matter if the event is past, present or future.

There is a terrible storm, the ferry is overdue. Those same people, probably now joined by countless others, all weigh in with their OPINIONS because, they have nothing else to go on. Remember, this is a time before radios, radar, etc.

1)The ferry went down.

2) The ferry must have sunk.

3) The ferry probably/likely sank.

4) The ferry may have gone down.

5) The ferry might have gone down.

6) The ferry didn't sink.

Again, at this point, with the available information, all are opinions, even 1) and 6), though one of them will, maybe, probably never, eventually be confirmed as fact.

But look at the modal perfect examples for that's the point I'm trying to get across. Sometimes, 'might' just means what it most often normally means, ""there's a tiny to small chance that X will occur/is occurring/has occurred"".

The ferry, I'm sad to report, [this is my scenario] went down. The people of that time only know this because no trace was ever found of the boat, the people or the things on the boat. No lifeboats were ever launched.

There is now rampant speculation among the population on whether a or some lifeboats would have saved lives.    

1) Lifeboats would have saved lives.

2) Lifeboats almost certainly would have saved lives.

[Note that 'must have saved lives', epistemically equal to 'almost certainly would have saved lives' isn't possible here]

3) Lifeboats probably/likely would have saved lives.

[Note that 'should have saved lives', is strange here even though 'should' is epistemically equal to 'probably/likely'.]

4) Lifeboats may have saved lives.

5) Lifeboats might have saved lives.

6) Lifeboats wouldn't have saved lives.

But all these are still simply personal opinions, not statements of fact.

Look at the 'may have' and 'might have' parts. There's no implication in the 'might have saved lives' opinion that lifeboats were launched. There's a fact that dismisses any such implication. No lifeboats were launched.

Certainly, there are situations where 'might' and 'may are used to effect a meaning other that their basic epistemic/level of certainty meanings. I noted this with respect to 'might' in my previous post.

We know that there are meanings for 'may' and for 'might' that are sometimes used to make a concession and sometimes, to angrily suggest [sometimes using understatement] that something should have been done. 

For this scenario, ""You might have [at the very least] sent out one search boat!"" 

What nohat stated was true, but it's not true for all situations, not even for most; I'd say that its true for a small portion of 'might have + PP' situations. 

I'm sorry that this is so long, but if you'll bear with me. I've read often this idea presented by nohat. It is similar in nature to the thought used to prohibit ""If S was"" as a counterfactual use. 

Somebody, sometime, noticed that ""If S was"" can hold the meaning of ""allowing that that is true, ... "", so they errantly made a determination that that excluded the counterfactual 'was' use in ""If I was you, ... "". 

Language is exceedingly complex and these kinds of expansive notions aren't helpful to come to an understanding of language. They have no affect on native speakers, save for the fact that the myths continue to be spread, but they have a gigantic affect on ESL/EFLs, both in terms of comprehension and production.

Another of these expansive notions is the idea that 'would' is subjunctive. It is not! There are only a few examples of the subjunctive left in English and 'would' is not one of them.

'would' can be, and is often used in subjunctive uses to express subjunctive/contrary to fact ideas, but so are a lot of other modals.

'would' also hold the meaning of 100% true, ""that would be Bill""; ""He would, ten years later, be elected president"". 

The original question, which I'm now pointedly getting to, [how does one illustrate a degree of embarrassment?]

My parents would have walked along the Barrow

likely, in my opinion, shows this same meaning of 'would', ie. 100% true. I may be wrong for this particular instance but that doesn't negate the fact that that is how 'would' is often used. 


  Cindi noted: I think the intention is
  to evoke the event rather than just
  record it.


Cindi and I disagree. She has an opinion on how 'would' is being used here that differs from my opinion. She may well be right. The speaker could be using 'would have' in the same sense as 'must have', which would express some degree of doubt.

4526,4526,7171,Postfix or exim: Automated/Programmatic and forwarded email setup,"I'm looking to replace our current use of an external smtp provider with an in-house installation. It should handle the following situations:


Certain addresses should be forwarded to gmail addresses; we'd like to continue to use gmail as our primary email interface.
Other addresses should be available as pop/imap mailboxes.
Other addresses will be handled programmatically: they'll kick off various tasks, get logged, etc. These addresses should either kick off a process to the handle the email addresses, or should store in an easily processable format.
It should also be fairly easily configurable with domain keys, spf, and anything else it takes to allow email deliverability.


I've used sendmail in the distant past. It seems postfix and exim are the recommended options these days. My main question is: what's the best choice and setup for the forwarding of the addresses to gmail, and for the programmatic access? Is procmail still the way to go or are there better options these days?

(If someone dies then having a copy of his memories and personality traits in a new body is not necessarily equal to that exact person living on. It's easy to consider the new manifestation simply as a mental/emotinal/[physical] clone that has just started living. Accepting the new clone as the old person's direct continuation requires quite a solid philosophical stance, like considering the Universe a simulation in which a ""physical person"" is just an instance of a ""meta-person object""... or something along these lines.)

2209,2209,3518,"Why does the C++ standard algorithm ""count"" return a ptrdiff_t instead of size_t?","Why is the return type of std::count a ptrdiff_t?

Since count can never be negative, isn't size_t technically the right choice? And what if the count exceeds the range of ptrdiff_t since the theoretical possible size of an array can be size_t?  



EDIT: So far there is no suitable answer as to why the function returns ptrdiff_t. Some explanation gathered from the answers below is that the return type is iterator_traits&lt;InputIterator&gt;::difference_type which is generic and can be anything.

What does these percentage mean? What is the equivalent of it in the metric system?

136,136,216,How suddenly does lactose-intolerance onset?,"How quickly can the loss of lactose tolerance onset in an adult?

Such as being able to process lactose normally to having notice symptoms associated with the inability to process lactose.

I am not asking how long it takes to digest food, but rather how long it takes for lactose intolerance to become noticeable (hours, days, weeks, months, years).
",Chase,https://biology.stackexchange.com/users/4022,"Disclaimer: I am not medically qualified, and this answer must not be construed as being medical advice of any kind.

Primary adult hypolactasia is the most common cause of lactose intolerance. The majority of the world's population have this phenotype. 

In these individuals, at weaning, there is a reduction in the level of the enzyme lactase, which is responsible for digesting lactose to galactose and glucose in the small intestine. Undigested lactose can create symptoms via osmotic effects (causing diarrhoea) and because it is metabolised by bacteria in the colon, producing gas and thus abdominal bloating.

About 35% of adults have a genetic variant in an region upstream of the lactase gene which results in the expression of lactase continuing into adult life. These individuals are lactose tolerant. This trait is most common in Northern Europe.

According to references cited in  


  Ingram, CJE et al. (2009) Lactose digestion and the evolutionary genetics of lactase persistence Hum Genet (2009) 124:579–591 


(I have removed citations from the passage for clarity.)


  ""most lactase non-persistent individuals can tolerate small amounts of lactose (as in tea or coffee), and some can consume a lot without ill effects. Variation in the composition of the gut flora between individuals, as well as a psychosomatic component may account for some of the interindividual variation in symptoms.""


The clear implication is that there is a lot of variation in the tolerance of lactose amongst those lacking the lactase persistence trait. Given the contribution of the gut flora to the symptoms these could presumably vary as a result of, for example, antibiotic treatment. Also I imagine that the effects of undigested lactose could be synergistic with some other gut disturbance.

Added in response to comment from the OP:

In someone with the (common) genotype that corresponds to 'no persistence of lactase' the possibility of showing symptoms will be present from a young age. Apparently there is a lot of variation in the severity of symptoms. If an adult suddenly exhibits symptoms then I am suggesting that this could be due to an interaction of non-persistence with some other gut disturbance - I imagine this could happen quite quickly. Alternatively I suppose that a change in diet could trigger symptoms.

I'm a noob in using regex and here is my problem - I need to check a password if it contains 4 consecutive characters. so far what I have just covered is regarding the digits. Here is my regex:

ascending digits - ^.?(?:0123|1234|2345|3456|4567|5678|6789).$

descending digits - ^.?(?:9876|8765|7654|6543|5432|4321|3210).$

This works only for the digits. I know this is already an overkill in regex so I dont want to do it with the letters. It will be waaay too overkill if I do that.

4539,4539,7192,Analytical solution to PDE,"I am trying to solve the following linear pde where $u=f(x,y)$ in the domain $y \in  (0,\infty)$: 
$$y\dfrac{\partial{u}}{\partial x} = \dfrac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2}$$
with boundary conditions: 
$$u(x,0)=\sin(x) $$ 
$$\lim_{y \rightarrow \infty} u(x,y) = 0 .$$

Can someone please suggest how do I proceed to get the analytical solution for this equation? 



Solution: 

Using method of separation of variables, 
we assume solution to be of the form: $$u(x,y)=X(x).Y(y) $$
Inserting this to the pde, we get: 
$$yX'Y=XY'' $$
$$\dfrac{X'}{X}=\dfrac{Y''}{yY}=-\lambda$$
Now we get the following ode's 
$$X'+\lambda X=0 $$
$$Y'' + \lambda y Y = 0 $$

from which we get two general solutions of the following form: 
$$X(x) = c_1\exp(-\lambda x) \qquad Y(y) = c_2Ai(\lambda^{1/3} y) + c_3Bi(\lambda^{1/3} y)  $$ where $Ai$ and $Bi $ are Airy's functions and the general solution can be expressed as: 
$$u(x,y) =  c_1\exp(-\lambda x).(c_2Ai(\lambda^{1/3} y) + c_3Bi(\lambda^{1/3} y))$$

$c_3 \rightarrow 0 $ to satisfy second boundary condition since $Bi(\infty) \rightarrow \infty $ and hence, solution is of the form: 

$$u(x,y) = A \exp(-\lambda x) Ai(\lambda^{1/3} y) $$
Putting $y=0$, 
$$u(x,0) = A\exp(-\lambda x).\dfrac{1}{3^{2/3}}\Gamma({2/3}) = \sin(x) $$

How should I now proceed to find $A$ and $\lambda$, considering that $\lambda$ needs to be positive real value?

Can such a thing be done?  I have a vague idea that I might make a text file with a list of the new names and call that list @newnames.  I would make another array out of the current file names, and call it @oldnames.  I'd then do some kind of for loop where each element $i in @oldnames is replaced by the corresponding $i in @newnames.

I don't know how to make an array out of my current file names, though, and so I'm not sure if this vague idea is on the right track.  I keep my files with the messed-up names in a directory called 'oldnames'. The below is my attempt to make an array out of the file names in that directory:

my $dir = 'oldnames';
opendir ('oldnames', $dir) or die ""cannot open dir $dir: $!"";

4235,4235,6752,Does this statement make any sense?,"I am asking this question completely out of curiosity. The other day, my roommate, by mistake, used 'Light year' as a unit of time instead of distance. When I corrected him (pedantic, much), he said the following:

""Units are relative. And according to Fourier Transforms, units can be changed so Light year is a unit of time.""

That got me thinking and I read up Fourier Transforms on wikipedia but couldn't find anything about using a unit in one domain as a unit for another measurement. I do agree that units (particularly, base units are relative. eg: the meter), but does his statement make any sense?

EDIT
Thank you everyone for all the answers. It isn't so much to in it in or prove a point as it is to understand the concept better. Anyways this is his response after I showed him this thread. Any comments would be appreciated.

His response:
Nevermind, for the first time I accept I was wrong. BUT using lightyears to measure time is possible. My example didn't make sense bacause I was wrong when I meantioned that I'm still measuring dist. If you have a signal in time domain and ...take the FT, I get a signal which DOES NOT HAVE to be in frequency domain. Clarify this to the guy who posted last. Now the new signal is in a domain defined by me and so is its units. This signal although not equal to the original signal, still represents that if ya take an inverse FT. So, the idea of time will still be there. Now coming back to our case: lightyears here is not the lightyears you are used to read when dealing with distance. It represents time.

It's possible if you rape physics, definitions, and just organize things so that you actually, in the end, obtain time from dimensional analysis. The idea would go along this line of reasoning:


I know a man walks 5 km/h, hence
space is a unit of time because I can say 10 km is equivalent to two hours, hence
I can measure time by specifying a distance. Let's meet in 5 kilometers at the pub 200 meters from here.


But that's not a unit definition. it's just a deep misrepresentation of concepts: using this approach, you can define everything in terms of anything else, assuming there's a relationship among them. you could define time in terms of weight of apples a man can move from the tree to a box.

Also, the whole setup is pretty circular in definition. You define time as space traveled by something at a constant speed for a defined time, so in the end your pulled you own bootstraps.

A Fourier transform is nothing but finding the coefficients of a linear combination of plane waves. When you find these coefficients, you can express the original function as the linear combination of these coefficients and a plane wave. If you note, there's a unit relationship between the domain before the FT and after. seconds -> seconds^(-1) = Hz. So even if you want to do fourier decomposition of a space-based periodic or aperiodic system, the resulting domain will be in meters^(-1), which is eventually a wave number. 


  Clarify this to the guy who

  a domain defined by me and so is its

Nope, it just turns out from the dimensional analysis that this is not the case. Clearly, you can always transform your frobbles units into Hertz through an ad-hoc transformation you invent (see the man-apples above) but that would still not change the final dimensional analysis of your FT, and you would, in any case, introduce an arbitrary constant (in our case above, the walking speed) which, in the end, likely produces a circular definition.

Lightyears is a measure of distance. It is a product of two well defined constants: the speed of light and a well defined amount of time. Simple dimensional analysis tells you it's a distance.

4714,4714,7476,JSP mechanism for nav bar template/module,"I have a navigation bar and, for some pages, a sub-navigation bar as well.  I'd like to make this a module so I can easily import the navigation bars on each page.  Easy enough to simply put the code in a JSP file and call:

&lt;%@include file=""/WEB-INF/jsp/includes/sub_nav_bar.jsp""%&gt;


the only issue is the links and their labels change depending on what page you're on.  So my options are to create separate navigation bars for various groups of pages or pass in variables representing the links and labels.  Separate navigation bars isn't attractive because there are so many variations, particularly with the sub nav bars.  I'll end up with tons of navigation bars, all of which I have to maintain.

The variables approach works, but I'm hoping there's a better way to do this.  It's so messy and lengthy.  If I want to later have drop down menus, it's going to be even much worse.  Basically, I've done something to this effect:

&lt;c:set var=""subNav"" value=""1""/&gt;
&lt;c:set var=""subNavLink1"" value=""/""/&gt;
&lt;c:set var=""subNavLabel1"" value=""Home""/&gt;
&lt;c:set var=""subNavLink2"" value=""/fun""/&gt;
&lt;c:set var=""subNavLabel2"" value=""Fun Stuff""/&gt;
&lt;c:set var=""subNavLink3"" value=""/more""/&gt;
&lt;c:set var=""subNavLabel3"" value=""More Stuff""/&gt;
&lt;%@include file=""/WEB-INF/jsp/includes/sub_nav_bar.jsp""%&gt;


the sub_nav_bar.jsp include file looks pretty ugly:

&lt;ul id=""sub-nav""&gt;
    &lt;li class=""&lt;c:if test=""${subNav!='1'}""&gt;in&lt;/c:if&gt;active""&gt;&lt;a href=""&lt;c:url value='${subNavLink1}'/&gt;""&gt;${subNavLabel1}&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;c:if test=""${subNavLink2!=null}""&gt;&lt;li class=""&lt;c:if test=""${subNav!='2'}""&gt;in&lt;/c:if&gt;active""&gt;&lt;a href=""&lt;c:url value='${subNavLink2}'/&gt;""&gt;${subNavLabel2}&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/c:if&gt;

",Daft,https://salesforce.stackexchange.com/users/3822,"You need to get the value into the scope that your view uses. The normal place to do that is in the controller JavaScript for the view, with the value being in the model that is already added to the scope or with the value being added separately.

Edit: I have found how to do it. In Project Properties > Build > Documenting you can set Additional Javadoc Options. The option to use is -link and then the URL of the documentation directory. However, I can only get it to work with an absolute link and am having trouble getting the relative link to work.

-link file:///A:\B\C\Util\dist\javadoc //this works
-link file: ..\..\..\Util\dist\javadoc //this doesn't works


Both project folders are in directory C, so I think that should be the correct relative path based on the documentation.

3223,3223,5142,Euclid's Algorithm (Greatest Common Divisor),"According to Donald Knuth in ""The Art Of Computer Programming"", the following is how to find the greatest common divisor of two positive numbers, m and n, using Euclid's Algorithm.


  
  Divide m by n and let r be the remainder.
  If r is 0, n is the answer; if r is not 0, continue to step 3.
  Set m = n and n = r. Go back to step 1.
  


Below is my implementation of this algorithm.

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int greatestCommonDivisor(int m, int n)
{
    int r;

    /* Check For Proper Input */
    if((m == 0) || (n == 0))
        return 0;
    else if((m &lt; 0) || (n &lt; 0))
        return -1;

    do
    {
        r = m % n;
        if(r == 0)
            break;
        m = n;
        n = r;
    }
    while(true);

    return n;
}

int main(void)
{
    int num1 = 600, num2 = 120;
    int gcd = greatestCommonDivisor(num1, num2); 

    printf(""The GCD of %d and %d is %d\n"", num1, num2, gcd);

    getchar();
    return 0;
}


Though it appears to work just fine, it doesn't seem to be as elegant as I'd like, especially in the do-while loop.  Also, the while(true) seems dangerous, though I'm pretty confident that r will be reduced to 0 eventually and we'll break out of the loop.

Do you have any suggestions on either making the code more elegant or robust?

",Maria Zverina,https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/users/188,"GPS Receiver

I would go for a generic usb GPS receiver such as the BU-353



It works with the Raspberry Pi, just like a normal linux computer. 

Most usb GPS receivers are just USB-to-Serial adapters that read the NMEA data from the GPS receiver. Look into pl2303 (many units i've seen use this particular chip) drivers, should be available. 

You can also use GPIO and a traditional NMEA 0183 GPS receiver, but then you need to worry about power, and the prices are often higher. GPS antannas are common onboard boats and ships, and usually consume 12v.

The usb solution is cheaper.

The gps receiver I mentioned is compatible with gpsd.

5883,5883,9319,PDFNet SDK Convert files on Azure storage,"I have a web app that needs to convert PDFs to XODs (PDFTron’s format to display documents in their WebViewer). My Web App is hosted on Azure, the PDFs are on Azure Storage. We would like to go along with the on-premises conversion via PDFNet SDK (http://www.pdftron.com/webviewer/getstarted.html, see “Choosing a deployment model for conversions), my code so far is the following: 

WebRequest req = HttpWebRequest.Create(""url of PDF on Azure Storage here"");                         
using (Stream stream = req.GetResponse().GetResponseStream())
{
    PDFDoc pdfdoc = new PDFDoc(stream);
    var converted = pdftron.PDF.Convert.ToXod(pdfdoc);
    //pdfdoc.Save(stream, pdftron.SDF.SDFDoc.SaveOptions.e_linearized); //not clear to me
}


My approach here is to create a stream from the file on azure storage and convert that stream to XOD. I still don’t know if I should call “Save” and in that case where the file would be saved.
My questions are:


Since everything runs on the cloud does it make sense to use the CloudAPI instead of the self-hosted solution or does it not make any difference?
In both cases, where is the converted file stored (since I am getting it from the Azure storage and not from a local server), since I would then need to move it to my azure storage account. Does the file get saved locally (meaning on the web/worker role which is processing it) and therefore needs to be moved to the storage?

If you were to go with the cloud solution, you would transfer your files to PDFTron's servers, where they will be converted.  Then you would download the converted files.

If you were to go with the on-premises solution, you would need to run DocPub CLI (https://www.pdftron.com/docpub/downloads.html) on your Azure instance, and its only communication with PDFTron would be to increment the billing counter for your PWS account (https://www.pdftron.com/pws/index.html).

5046,5046,8028,Invariance of dynamical system under a transformation,"I have come across an interesting property of a dynamical system, being transformed by a map, but i haven't been able to figure out why this is happening (for quite some time now actually). Any help is greatly appreciated. Here goes then:

Let M be a n-D manifold and $\dot x=F(x)u_1, F\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times m}, x \in \mathbb{R}^{n}, u_1 \in \mathbb{R}^{m}$ be a control system evolving on M (F is the system matrix i.e. state transition function, and $u_1$ is the input of the system. For all practical purposes $u_1$ is an m-vector from an input space $\mathbb{R}^{m}$). Now let $x=\Psi (y)$ be a coordinate change on M and $u_2=M(y)u_1$ a transformation of the input $u_1$ of the first system. By applying these maps on the system, you get the new equations  $\dot y=F(y)u_2$. As you may notice, F is the same in both systems. The problem is why is this happening i.e. for what systems and transformations does this property hold?

A little more elaboration

It is useful to investigate the maps more closely. In the general case one has

$\dot x=D\Psi \dot y$
$\dot x= F(x)u_1$

thus
$\dot y=D\Psi ^{-1} F(x)u_1$, (1)

where $D\Psi$ is the Jacobian matrix of $\Psi$. In our case it actually turns out that:  

$\dot y=F(y)M(y)u_1$. (2)

You can then consider that $u_2=M(y)u_1$ and get the final system,

$\dot y=F(y)u_2$,

that is, the same system.
 By (1),(2) you get,

$D\Psi ^{-1} F(x)u_1=F(y)M(y)u_1 \Rightarrow (D\Psi ^{-1} F(x)-F(y)M(y))u_1=0$. 

Since this holds for every $u_1$, you have the condition,

347,347,553,Lychrel calculator (Project Euler 55),"
  If we take 47, reverse and add, 47 + 74 = 121, which is palindromic.
  
  Not all numbers produce palindromes so quickly. For example,

349 + 943 = 1292,
1292 + 2921 = 4213
4213 + 3124 = 7337

  
  That is, 349 took three iterations to arrive at a palindrome.
  
  Although no one has proved it yet, it is thought that some numbers,
  like 196, never produce a palindrome. A number that never forms a
  palindrome through the reverse and add process is called a Lychrel
  number. Due to the theoretical nature of these numbers, and for the
  purpose of this problem, we shall assume that a number is Lychrel
  until proven otherwise. In addition you are given that for every
  number below ten-thousand, it will either (i) become a palindrome in
  less than fifty iterations, or, (ii) no one, with all the computing
  power that exists, has managed so far to map it to a palindrome. In
  fact, 10677 is the first number to be shown to require over fifty
  iterations before producing a palindrome: 4668731596684224866951378664
  (53 iterations, 28-digits).
  
  Surprisingly, there are palindromic numbers that are themselves
  Lychrel numbers; the first example is 4994.
  
  How many Lychrel numbers are there below ten-thousand?


This is my solution:

from datetime import datetime

candidates = []

def reverse(number):
    ''' Returns the reverse order of an integer,
        for example: reverse(123) returns the integer 321 '''
    number = str(number)
    return int(number[::-1])

def is_lychrel(number):
    ''' Returns True if 'number' is a lychrel candidate,
        but works only with numbers from 1 to 10000 '''
    iterated = number + reverse(number)
    for i in range(25):
        rev_iterated = reverse(iterated)
        if iterated != rev_iterated:
            iterated = iterated + rev_iterated
        else:
            return False
    return True

if __name__ == '__main__':

    start_time = datetime.now()

    for number in range(10001):
        if is_lychrel(number):
            candidates.append(number)

    time = datetime.now() - start_time # To get the time of the calculation

    print('In {} were found {} lychrel candidates'.format(time, len(candidates)))
    print(' '.join(map(str, candidates)), 'are candidates.')
    suml = input('Press ENTER to close ')


On my PC (with Intel Atom 2GHz), I got it with .4 seconds.  Could you offer suggestions on making it run faster?
",matheussilvapb,https://codereview.stackexchange.com/users/37913,"Hints


According to the example in the problem description, 349 is not a Lychrel number. As a hint for speeding things up, I'd like to point out that the example computation might also tell you something about, say, the number 1292.

What I'm trying to say is that when you evaluate 1292, you will be performing part of the same computation that you already did with 349. The same applies to the reversed forms of each number, but there's a catch: the reversal is not symmetric when trailing zeros are present. 210 reversed is 12, but 12 reversed is 21.
A single reverse-add operation typically maps multiple numbers to the same number. If you figure out how that works, you can reduce the number of cases you need to consider.


Changes suggested by hint 1


To be able to take timings with timeit, I first rearranged your top-level code to a function. I also changed the ranges to 50 and 10000, for reasons explained in Gareth's answer.

def e55():
    candidates = []
    for number in range(10000):
        if is_lychrel(number):
            candidates.append(number)
    return len(candidates)


This runs in 158 ms on my computer:

$ python3 -m timeit -s ""from e55_op import e55"" ""e55()"" 
10 loops, best of 3: 158 msec per loop    

The main function could be written more concisely. This one is marginally slower at 161 ms:

def e55():
    return sum(1 for number in range(10000) if is_lychrel(number))

Now to the performance optimization. I want to avoid following the same sequence of iteration more than once. First, I'll extract the loop from is_lychrel into a recursive function. This in itself does not make it run faster, but neither does it slow it down.

def check(number, depth):
    ''' Returns True if 'number' is neither a palindrome
    nor becomes one in 'depth' iterations of reverse-add.'''
    rev = reverse(number)
    return number != rev and (not depth or check(number + rev, depth-1))

def is_lychrel(number):
    ''' Returns True if 'number' is a lychrel candidate,
        but works only with numbers from 1 to 10000 '''
    return check(number + reverse(number), 49) 

The speedup comes from making the recursive function cache its return values in a dictionary. I'll also eliminate the is_lychrel function as it is called from only one place.


The complete code is below and runs in 36.5 ms. I also timed Gareth's proposal: 54.8 ms.

def reverse(number):
    ''' Returns the reverse order of an integer,
        for example: reverse(123) returns the integer 321 '''
    number = str(number)
    return int(number[::-1])

def check(number, depth, cache):
    ''' Returns True if 'number' is neither a palindrome
        nor becomes one in 'depth' iterations of reverse-add.'''
    if number not in cache:
        rev = reverse(number)
        cache[number] = (number != rev 
            and (not depth or check(number + rev, depth-1, cache)))
    return cache[number]

def e55():
    cache = {}
    return sum(1 for number in range(10000) 
               if check(number + reverse(number), 49, cache))


Notes:


I'm resetting the cache inside e55 because timeit runs the function multiple times. Each iteration has to be able to start from the same state.
Calling check with depth=49 causes 50 iterations to be evaluated, because it starts from an already reverse-added number.


Hint 2: math

Let's consider all 4-digit numbers. Labeling the digits abcd we can represent the number as 

a*1000 + b*100 + c*10 + d


Reverse-add results in

(a+d)*1000 + (b+c)*100 + (c+b)*10 + (d+a)
= (a+d)*1001 + (b+c)*110


As a ranges from 1 to 9 and the other digits from 0 to 9, (a+d) can take values from 1 to 18 and (b+c) from 0 to 18. Thus there are 18*19 = 342 possible values for the expression (a+d)*1001 + (b+c)*110. That gives an opportunity to speed up the program if we make it loop over the 342 sums instead of the 9000 4-digit numbers. There is the extra complication that we need to calculate how many numbers map to each reverse-add result, but that is not very complicated. 

The 3-, 2- and 1-digit cases can be analyzed in the same way.

Hint 2: implementation

I'm using collections.Counter to determine how many ways there are to add two numbers for each sum. I've inlined the reverse function because it is called from only one place.

This code runs in 4.64 ms, which is a 34X speedup from the original.

from collections import Counter

def check(number, depth, cache):
    ''' Returns True if 'number' is neither a palindrome
        nor becomes one in 'depth' iterations of reverse-add.'''
    if number not in cache:
        rev = int(str(number)[::-1])
        cache[number] = (number != rev 
            and (not depth or check(number + rev, depth-1, cache)))
    return cache[number]

def cases():
    ''' Yields numbers that can result from reverse-adding numbers
        below 10000, and the frequency of each'''
    freqs00_99 = Counter(i % 10 + i // 10 for i in range(100))
    freqs10_99 = Counter(i % 10 + i // 10 for i in range(10,100))

    for i in range(10):
        yield 2*i, 1        # from one digit
    for i, f_outer in freqs10_99.items():
        yield 11*i, f_outer # from two digits
        for j in range(10):
            yield 101*i + 20*j, f_outer  # from three digits
        for j, f_inner in freqs00_99.items():
            yield 1001*i + 110*j, f_outer*f_inner   # from four digits

def e55():

According to the example in the problem description, 349 is not a Lychrel number. As a hint for speeding things up, I'd like to point out that the example computation might also tell you something about, say, the number 1292.

What I'm trying to say is that when you evaluate 1292, you will be performing part of the same computation that you already did with 349. The same applies to the reversed forms of each number, but there's a catch: the reversal is not symmetric when trailing zeros are present. 210 reversed is 12, but 12 reversed is 21.
A single reverse-add operation typically maps multiple numbers to the same number. If you figure out how that works, you can reduce the number of cases you need to consider.


Changes suggested by hint 1


To be able to take timings with timeit, I first rearranged your top-level code to a function. I also changed the ranges to 50 and 10000, for reasons explained in Gareth's answer.

def e55():
    candidates = []
    for number in range(10000):
        if is_lychrel(number):
            candidates.append(number)
    return len(candidates)


This runs in 158 ms on my computer:

$ python3 -m timeit -s ""from e55_op import e55"" ""e55()"" 
10 loops, best of 3: 158 msec per loop    

The main function could be written more concisely. This one is marginally slower at 161 ms:

def e55():
    return sum(1 for number in range(10000) if is_lychrel(number))

Now to the performance optimization. I want to avoid following the same sequence of iteration more than once. First, I'll extract the loop from is_lychrel into a recursive function. This in itself does not make it run faster, but neither does it slow it down.

def check(number, depth):
    ''' Returns True if 'number' is neither a palindrome
    nor becomes one in 'depth' iterations of reverse-add.'''
    rev = reverse(number)
    return number != rev and (not depth or check(number + rev, depth-1))

def is_lychrel(number):
    ''' Returns True if 'number' is a lychrel candidate,
        but works only with numbers from 1 to 10000 '''
    return check(number + reverse(number), 49) 

The speedup comes from making the recursive function cache its return values in a dictionary. I'll also eliminate the is_lychrel function as it is called from only one place.


The complete code is below and runs in 36.5 ms. I also timed Gareth's proposal: 54.8 ms.

def reverse(number):
    ''' Returns the reverse order of an integer,
        for example: reverse(123) returns the integer 321 '''
    number = str(number)
    return int(number[::-1])

def check(number, depth, cache):
    ''' Returns True if 'number' is neither a palindrome
        nor becomes one in 'depth' iterations of reverse-add.'''
    if number not in cache:
        rev = reverse(number)
        cache[number] = (number != rev 
            and (not depth or check(number + rev, depth-1, cache)))
    return cache[number]

def e55():
    cache = {}
    return sum(1 for number in range(10000) 
               if check(number + reverse(number), 49, cache))


Notes:


I'm resetting the cache inside e55 because timeit runs the function multiple times. Each iteration has to be able to start from the same state.
Calling check with depth=49 causes 50 iterations to be evaluated, because it starts from an already reverse-added number.


Hint 2: math

Let's consider all 4-digit numbers. Labeling the digits abcd we can represent the number as 

a*1000 + b*100 + c*10 + d


Reverse-add results in

(a+d)*1000 + (b+c)*100 + (c+b)*10 + (d+a)
= (a+d)*1001 + (b+c)*110


As a ranges from 1 to 9 and the other digits from 0 to 9, (a+d) can take values from 1 to 18 and (b+c) from 0 to 18. Thus there are 18*19 = 342 possible values for the expression (a+d)*1001 + (b+c)*110. That gives an opportunity to speed up the program if we make it loop over the 342 sums instead of the 9000 4-digit numbers. There is the extra complication that we need to calculate how many numbers map to each reverse-add result, but that is not very complicated. 

The 3-, 2- and 1-digit cases can be analyzed in the same way.

Hint 2: implementation

I'm using collections.Counter to determine how many ways there are to add two numbers for each sum. I've inlined the reverse function because it is called from only one place.

This code runs in 4.64 ms, which is a 34X speedup from the original.

from collections import Counter

def check(number, depth, cache):
    ''' Returns True if 'number' is neither a palindrome
        nor becomes one in 'depth' iterations of reverse-add.'''
    if number not in cache:
        rev = int(str(number)[::-1])
        cache[number] = (number != rev 
            and (not depth or check(number + rev, depth-1, cache)))
    return cache[number]

def cases():
    ''' Yields numbers that can result from reverse-adding numbers
        below 10000, and the frequency of each'''
    freqs00_99 = Counter(i % 10 + i // 10 for i in range(100))
    freqs10_99 = Counter(i % 10 + i // 10 for i in range(10,100))

    for i in range(10):
        yield 2*i, 1        # from one digit
    for i, f_outer in freqs10_99.items():
        yield 11*i, f_outer # from two digits
        for j in range(10):
            yield 101*i + 20*j, f_outer  # from three digits
        for j, f_inner in freqs00_99.items():
            yield 1001*i + 110*j, f_outer*f_inner   # from four digits

4921,4921,7833,Home Network Router Used as Gateway Develops High Latency,"I have a WRT54G2 router (V1) with the most recent firmware that serves as the gateway between my Internet connection and my home network. Over the past few months, I've noticed that the router seems to consistently become unusable due to high latency when it runs for any period of time. The internet connection is working, but the latency is sometimes as high as 2000ms to ping Google or to run a test from Speedtest.net. When a computer is directly plugged into the cable modem provided by my ISP, the problems resolve.

Restarting the router proivdes a resolution of the problem, but over time the latency issues increase again until it needs to be restarted. Right now, I have it on a mechanical (plug) timer that restarts it every morning around 4AM, but this still doesn't seem to fix the overall issue; I've had to restart the router manually twice today. Before restart, my ping will be over 1000ms; afterward, it will drop back to 20-60ms.

Note that the download and upload speeds don't seem to be affected by this, just the latency itself.

The problem appears on both wireless and wired connections.

I'm not sure if this is a sign that our router is failing (it was purchased in 2009, so as far as consumer-grade solutions go, it's lasted a pretty decent span), or if there's some misconfiguration on my end, or if something with my ISP is making my router flip out. What can/should I do to fix this issue (please note that flashing the router with DD-WRT is not an option, this version generally sees decreased performance when DD-WRT is installed).

EDITED TO ADD: I have ruled out internal traffic causing the problem (I reviewed the log files for the router and tried to identify any unknown stuff, but it seems fine). I can't quite figure out exactly what causes the router to develop the issue, but once it does, I've noticed the following:


Extremely high latency (1000ms+) for pings from any computer inside the network to an outside destination
The router itself cannot ping or traceroute once it has started developing these high latency issues - if you use the router's PING feature, it returns all timeouts.
It does not seem to correlate with any specific type of traffic.

4472,4472,7095,Equitably distributed curve on a sphere,"Let $\gamma=\gamma(L)$ be a
simple (non-self-intersecting) closed curve of length $L$
on the unit-radius sphere $S$.
So if $L=2\pi$, $\gamma$ could be a great circle.

I am seeking the most equitably distributed
$\gamma(L)$, distributed in the sense that
the length of $\gamma$ within any disk is minimized.
This is something like placing repelling electrons on a sphere,
but here the curve self-repels.
So there should be no ""clots"" of $\gamma$ anywhere on $S$.
I am especially interested in large $L$.
A possible $\gamma$ is shown below, surely not optimal for its length:

&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;




Here is an attempt to capture more formally ""equitably distributed.""
I find this an awkward definition, and perhaps there is a more
natural definition.

Around a point $c \in S$, measure the $r$-density
of $\gamma$ as the total length within an $r$-disk:
$$d_\gamma(c,r) = | \gamma \cap D(c,r)|$$
where $D(c,r)$ is the disk of geodesic radius $r$
centered on $c$.
Then define $d_\gamma(r)$ as the maximum of $d_\gamma(c,r)$ over
all $c \in S$.

Finally, we can say that, for two curves $\gamma_1$ and
$\gamma_2$ of the same length $L$, that
$\gamma_1 \le \gamma_2$
if $d_{\gamma_1}(r) \le d_{\gamma_2}(r)$
for all $r \in (0,\pi)$, i.e.,
$\gamma_1$ is less concentrated than $\gamma_2$ for all $r$
up to a hemisphere.

This definition provides a partial order on curves of a given length $L$.
One version of my question is:


  Q. What do the minimal elements of this poset
  look like, especially as $L$ gets large?


These minimal curves are in some sense nowhere densely clotted.

Update. Acknowledging Gerhard Paseman's remark, I thought I would include
this attractive image of a space-filling curve on a sphere:

1002,1002,1581,Silicone caulk for shower and tub?,"I am about to seal the gap between my tub and the wall tile with caulk (it was originally grout which cracked so I chiseled out what I could).

There's some logic to this, so I'm wondering - is he right? If so, what kind of caulk should I use?

797,797,1264,How can an Imperator Titan house a city on its shoulders when it's only 100 meters tall?,"I've often been confused at the size of Warhammer 40k titans. I've been reading one of the Horus Heresy books and it describes an Imperator class titan as having a small city on its shoulders with command stations, barracks, etc. At 100 meters tall, this is only 7 meters taller than the Statue of Liberty. I've been up the Statue of Liberty, and it definitely couldn't host a small city. I get that they're wider but still it seems that it's a bit of a stretch of imagination to suppose that it could host such a large structure.
",Neil Hanvey,https://scifi.stackexchange.com/users/36763,"This is partially a style issue. This is a partially medium translation issue. How the Imperator Titans look in the games and how they look in the minds of artists are completely different. There are no cities on the tops of these Imperator Titans. There is often a command center where the battle can be seen and managed since they supposed to tower over the battlefield stylistically and figuratively.




This is the Imperator Class Titan figure. Most of the time there is nothing around it, so you don't know how big it is in proportion to anything else. Different sculptures emphasize different things. Some are more ornate than others and have better detail. These are some of the early designs.





The titan is often shown not alongside anything that gives it scale. The structure on the top of the shoulders of the central body has three (possibly four) guns mounted on the very top for ranged mortar fire. Some of the early paintings depicted them like this. Again, nothing really to scale it against so it can look so large…
Some artists when they cast the Imperator Titan, in the right light, with billowing smoke wafting up from the craters below, it can seem monstrously large. Just the way the God Emperor's avatar, the Imperium's most terrifying war machine should look.





But if you are from one of those Forge worlds and stylish lighting isn't going to cut it, you can compare the size of the Imperator and realize it isn't a small city of there, nor a castle, instead it is just four very large cannons mounted there. There is also a heavily shielded command center with room enough for a good deal of staff. Maybe a latte bar. A matter of style over substance. 





Here how the figures compare to the field of battle at scale. The second image shows the Imperator against the other titans at scale. Look at the teeny-tiny space marine at his feet. Remember that guy is supposed to be this guy...

3368,3368,5375,"Best practice for getting ""If not foo"" conditionals","So, here are two ways you might set things up such that \dostuff is done when foo is false.

The ""new conditional"" method

If you know when foo is going to be set, then after that do:

\newif\ifnotfoo
\iffoo\notfoofalse\else\notfootrue\fi


And then use the \ifnotfoo test.

\ifnotfoo\dostuff\fi


The ""else"" method

Whenever you need to \dostuff, just do:

\iffoo\else\dostuff\fi


Is either method recommended over the other? If so, why? (Or is there another method which is even better?
",Seamus,https://tex.stackexchange.com/users/215,"Hard to comment on efficiency (one of your tags) without knowing more context. \footrue and \foofalse are really each just a \let. So if the only reason that this token is let to one definition or another is so that you can decide whether or not to ""do stuff"" then you don't need the if token at all, then you don't need the test.

Just define 

\def\foofalse{\let\dostuff\realstuff}
\def\footrue{\let\dostuff\relax}


then you can replace the \iffoo construct with simply

 \dostuff


and it will either do nothing or the real definition depending on whether \foofalse or \footrue was most recently executed. Since this saves expanding \iffoo and skipping over the conditional text it is more efficient in principle but whether the difference is measurable on modern machines I haven't checked.

1547,1547,2428,Why does my bike make a noise when I pedal hard?,"When I pedal forcing a little with my right leg, the bike makes a noise that I don't know how to describe. I'll try to do it. It's like:


a short ""ting""
a tiny bell
if a small rock hits the down tube


I don't know what is causing this noise, but I think that it could be any of this things:


pedal
crank arm/pedal connection
crankset


I think the material of all these things is alluminium.

I don't feel anything (like a bad shifted chain) when I hear the noise.

It happens when there is movement and when there is NO movement (I use the brake, so the bike doesn'e move, stand using all weight on right pedal, and it makes the noise)

The pedals could be in any position, It is not in a particular position. Just pressing the right pedal.

Has someone else has this ""problem""? Any ideas of where this comes from?

Update:
Yesterday I took out the chain and stood on the right pedal, and made the noise. Then is not the chain, nor the transmission system.

I put oil in the pedal axis, but had no luck. Also tried to loose the pedal, but the juncture point is too tight, and I couldn't.

Today I will try to use oil in the bottom bracket.

Update: here is a link to info on the bike http://www.diamondback.com/2012-sorrento maybe it helps to know the model of all the components.

151,151,239,Disabled buttons while long running task,"My application has a toolbar and a lot of buttons on it. Some buttons start a long running processes(tasks). At this moment every task executes asynchronously to allow user to do something else while task is executing.

Other problem, I should to protect other buttons from pressing (some of these would be disabled after done current tasks). In general, I have to disable all buttons (toolbar) to be sure that user cannot do something dangerous with buttons at transient. My questions are: 

Could someone recommend way to distract users from flickering (disable/enable buttons) or how to involve them in process, how to made them filling that task is not so long?

Maybe I should to execute tasks synchronously and disable all UI for time of execution? 

By the way:
Delay can vary from 1 to 10 sec. About progress bar: it is a difficult to calculate current progress, and it causes some performance degradation (task can be done faster without any additional UI iterations from other threads).

3099,3099,4936,Results with and without interaction,"I'm working on an analysis with another person. First we did a logistic regression with study group and variable X. They were both significant. Then we added the interaction between study group and X only the study group and the interaction were significant. Actually, there are 3 groups and only one of the groups and one of the group*X interactions is significant.  

I am having a hard time to convince this person that we should not present the odds ratios for X from the first analysis that do not account for this interaction. This person thinks that we can show the results of the first analysis AND then the second analysis. I think this is misleading and will confuse people.

",SB3,https://stats.stackexchange.com/users/42351,"I agree that it could cause confusion to present two fitted models, especially since it appears that one of them may not fit the data very well. You can tell by comparing the deviance or some other fit statistics for the two models to see if adding the interaction makes an important difference overall.

The interaction effects are doing a better job of explaining some of the effects that previously were explained by $X$ alone. This could happen, for example, if $X$ Is important for one group but not the others. Without the interaction, we are fitting an average X trend to the groups, which could be significant by virtue of the one group where it is significant.

One of the options I think there are, is to show letters of alphabet as indexes at the right side of a plain table. Since my first table is a grouped one, my navigation hierarchy would be then like this:

  

Would it be inconsistent to navigate from a grouped table to a plain table? If so, could somebody give an existing example? I didn't find anything related to this in iOS Human Interface Guidelines, maybe it is described somewhere else and this navigation pattern breaks the guidelines.

Another option could be having a search bar. Can a search bar be used in both a plain table and a grouped table? The existing example of such bar I found is in Contacts app and it is a plain table. In a plain table, could both an alphabet index and a search bar be shown?

1279,1279,2015,DIY Floating Desk in New Build Home,"Evening all,

It's my first time posting so be gentle, I've been reading a fair few of your posts and hope you can answer my question.



I've attached a picture of where I would like to build a ""floating"" desk. the width is approximately 217cm, and I'd ideally like it to be 70cm to 80cm deep.

The white lines are my rough idea for the frame, and the red indicates a radiator.

The wall on the right is a stud wall, and I have no idea what the other 2 are. The back one is clearly exterior and the other is a joining wall with another house.

I'm basing it on the design used here: http://overthebigmoon.com/diy-file-cabinet-desk-blendtec-giveaway/

I could possibly use supports similar to those if absolutely necessary.

My question is really about support. Will the desk bow in any way? Is it too wide? Will the frame suggested be sufficient? Does any one have any other thoughts? How will I attach it to the walls?

Thanks,
Ashley
",Ash Toolio,https://diy.stackexchange.com/users/37957,"I guess nobody else is going to take a swipe at answering this, so I'll give it a shot.

Will the desk bow in any way?

Depends on load and construction details. With the items pictured, even a pretty lightly constructed one will probably not bow/bend/sag much, and there are ways to frame it so that a much heavier load could be supported. What you need to do depends on what you anticipate possibly happening to the desk - if people might sit on it, it needs a good deal more support than if it's just holding a modern lightweight computer and sundries. But if you might set a box of papaer or books on it, then it needs more again...

Is it too wide?

No, subject to adequate framing.

Will the frame suggested be sufficient?

Color me dubious on that front. While it's sufficient for the purposes it was built for (evidently) it's more fully supported than what you are proposing to do, which allows it to be not so robust - but again, this is also load dependent, though having the desk break IF someone sits on it (even if you don't intend it to be used that way) can be somewhat annoying.

Does any one have any other thoughts? 

Stressed skin panel construction offers some interesting possibilities, depending what you are up for, and what you are looking for.

How will I attach it to the walls?

Multiple options. Ledger boards on each end are a good approach if you don't mind them being visible. File cabinets and no wall attachment as with the linked plans are another approach, but evidently not what you want. Huge shelf brackets as you mentioned in a comment are another option. Much of this comes down to YOUR concept of a ""floating"" desk or how important it is that the desk slab appears to be sitting there with ""no visible means of support"" and whether that means ""nothing visible when standing 6 feet away"" or ""nothing visible when lying on the floor.""

In the ""can be effectively invisible"" line, you attach angle iron to the side walls, build a thick-ish (you can thin the front edge) slab, cut slits in the ends that slide over the angle irons and slide it in place. That calls for some precision crafting. The slab needs to be thick-ish both so that you can have a non-contributing part below the angle iron to conceal it, and so it's stiff enough to span 2 meters while only being supported at the extreme ends.

Less drastically austere solutions allow for a cross-beam below the desk surface but beyond/above where your knees would hit it, and visible supports on the end walls that the desk slab sets on top of. 

The giant shelf bracket approach is arguably ""not really floating"" but does have no ""feet"" or ""legs"" down to the floor.

All will hold the desk slab up. Different ones require more or less structure from the desk slab itself, due to greater or lesser spacing between support elements.

3465,3465,5519,struts2+spring3: passing a variable from action to jsp (javascript code),"First of all, thank you very much to all these that are trying to solve our problems in this forum;)

I am developing a web application with struts2+spring3. And I have a question about how to pass a variable (an array of arrays) from the action class to the jsp page.

I know that the only you need to do is to declare a private variable in my action and a get method for that variable and then its possible to access these variable from the jsp, I have done it and it works.

public class Workspace extends ActionSupport {

private String[][] objects=null;

public String[][] getObjects() {
    return objects;
}

public String execute() throws Exception{


The problem is that I want to access to this variable from the javascript code before loading the whole web page.

I have tried by different ways but it is never working.

$(function() {
var objectsMap=new Array();

    $(document).ready(function() {
          objectsMap = $objects;
    });


neither works (the alert says: ""Value: undefined""):

    &lt;s:set name=""auxObj"" value=""%{objects}""/&gt;
    &lt;script&gt;
        alert(""Value: ""+$(""#auxObj"").val());
    &lt;/script&gt;


Anyone have idea about how could I do that?

Thank you very very much!

5714,5714,9054,iMac wakes up without any noticeable reason,"I have a iMac 27"" late 2012, OS X 10.8.4 and last night it woke up from sleep-mode while I was 3 meters away from it. Nobody but me was in the room. The login-Screen was visible. After some seconds the main screen went black again, but the screen of the second monitor (from LG, connected via a thunderbolt-adapter) kept glowing in a dark gray light. So I hit a key on the keyboard, the mac woke up again, and I sent it to sleep by pressing the power-button. Now both screen was black and I went to bed.  

I did google that today and I found the command pmset -g log which prints out a hybernate-log, and in this log I found evidence for even more strange wake-up-events. This is a part of this log:

Sleep/Wakes since boot:31   Dark Wake Count in this sleep cycle:1


The spooky wake-up-event I was watching was at 2013-08-10 22:50:51
But the logfile shows even more activities while I was sleeping in my bed:

2013-08-11 00:01:35
2013-08-11 02:52:04
2013-08-11 04:07:32  

The next wake-up was initiated by me: 2013-08-11 04:07:32
But what are the reasons for those events in the middle of the night? Why did my iMac wake up?

UPDATE

EHC1 corresponds with the times when I did wake up the machine.
EC.SleepTimer are wake-ups that happened without my interaction.
What are EHC1 and EC.SleepTimer?
",Hubert Schölnast,https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/25938,"Check your log messages by typing following in Terminal while looking for the time stamp for when it occurred.

syslog |grep -i ""Wake reason""


which will give you a comprehensive report only for wake up reasons.

UPDATE:

Looking at your log now, it all looks normal. 

Be aware that the only time your computer can do some housekeeping is during the sleep time. That is intended by design. 

However, to prevent unwanted wake ups disable the wake for wifi network access.

Nobody but me was in the room. The login-Screen was visible. After some seconds the main screen went black again, but the screen of the second monitor (from LG, connected via a thunderbolt-adapter) kept glowing in a dark gray light. So I hit a key on the keyboard, the mac woke up again, and I sent it to sleep by pressing the power-button. Now both screen was black and I went to bed.  

I did google that today and I found the command pmset -g log which prints out a hybernate-log, and in this log I found evidence for even more strange wake-up-events. This is a part of this log:

Sleep/Wakes since boot:31   Dark Wake Count in this sleep cycle:1


The spooky wake-up-event I was watching was at 2013-08-10 22:50:51
But the logfile shows even more activities while I was sleeping in my bed:

2013-08-11 00:01:35
2013-08-11 02:52:04
2013-08-11 04:07:32  

The next wake-up was initiated by me: 2013-08-11 04:07:32
But what are the reasons for those events in the middle of the night? Why did my iMac wake up?

EHC1 corresponds with the times when I did wake up the machine.
EC.SleepTimer are wake-ups that happened without my interaction.
What are EHC1 and EC.SleepTimer?
","Check your log messages by typing following in Terminal while looking for the time stamp for when it occurred.

syslog |grep -i ""Wake reason""


which will give you a comprehensive report only for wake up reasons.

UPDATE:

Looking at your log now, it all looks normal. 

Be aware that the only time your computer can do some housekeeping is during the sleep time. That is intended by design. 

However, to prevent unwanted wake ups disable the wake for wifi network access.

I will be attending university this coming semester and am planning on maintaining a sustainable financial situation right now, but would like any good tips or suggestions to saving money as a student.
",JFW,https://money.stackexchange.com/users/1408,"Spend less.  

As @jldugger said, shop around for textbooks.  Make sure to look for used books: you can sometimes save a lot of money there.

Be smart about food money.  I could go to our on-campus grill and get a sandwich and a salad for lunch.  If I packed both with toppings, the salad could be a 2nd meal for the same day.  If you have the option, get a meal plan that is just 1 meal a day, and eat a lot that meal.

Don't do the starbucks ""pay several dollars for a coffee each day"" thing.  Small-ish regular expenses add up quickly.  

Quit smoking (if applicable).

Ditch your car if possible.  Some colleges are in cities with good public transportation or are small enough that a bike will do.  Cars are very expensive. 

Try to find free activities to do in your free time.  Usually college towns are great places to find free fun.  Pick-up sports, student concerts/art shows, playing board/card/video games.

Make sure to track how you're spending money to look for areas where you could be spending less.  There are plenty of tools available to help with this.  

Some on-campus jobs involve sitting around and occasionally doing something: IE working the checkout desk at the library.  A job like this (if you can find one) can effectively pay you for doing our homework.

One other very important college-related financial tip is to not take out more loans than you can afford.  I've heard a good rule of thumb is not take our more loans than you expect to earn your first year after graduating.  Look up average starting salaries for the career you realistically expect to have after you graduate.  If you would need to borrow much more than that to get your degree, rethink your plans.  Being a slave to a bank for years is a crappy way to spend your life.

In particular, 


I can't see how a negatively charged electron can stay in ""orbit"" around a positively charged nucleus. Even if the electron actually orbits the nucleus, wouldn't that orbit eventually decay? 
I can't reconcile the rapidly moving electrons required by the planetary model with the way atoms are described as forming bonds. If electrons are zooming around in orbits, how do they suddenly ""stop"" to form bonds.




I understand that certain aspects of quantum mechanics were created to address these problems, and that there are other models of atoms. My question here is whether the planetary model itself addresses these concerns in some way (that I'm missing) and whether I'm right to be uncomfortable with it.

Marketing is way more efficient (aka delivering better conversion rates) if the promise made in the marketing messages (usually: ""Our product is great"") is kept by the product itself. And many successful digital products distinguish themselfs by great UX.

How to move the s arrow down without increasing the radius for the circle? I mean, I'd like to have a bigger space between the arrow and B. I know that I could add a new line but I'd like to keep only one.
Why \displaystyle is lifting A? How to write correctly the middle fraction? I tried \dfrac but no success.


MWE

\documentclass[12pt,margin=0mm]{standalone}
\usepackage[all]{xy}

\begin{document}
$\xymatrix{%
  A \ar[r]  \ar `d/8pt[r] `[rr]_{s} [rr]
&amp;
  \displaystyle\frac{A}{B} \ar[r]
&amp;
  \frac{A}{B}
}$
\end{document}



",Sigur,https://tex.stackexchange.com/users/14757,"
The arrow head gets broken when touching the target. You have to shift the whole arrow down until it fits again. If you replace the fraction by just A, it works.
You have just the possibility to shift the arrow like in \ar@&lt;-1ex&gt; or to increase the radius. I would not do both but just increase the vertical height of the first cell.
I loaded amsmath and \dfrac works as expected. \xymatrix gets set in inline math style. No matter if you put it in $$ or in \[\] ([preview] option to standalone needed)


Here is my approach. I just found out that the depth of the first cell has to be a little bit bigger than the depth of the last cell. The bigger the subscript, the bigger the distance between s and \dfrac{A}{B}

% arara: pdflatex

\documentclass[12pt]{standalone}
\usepackage[all,cmtip]{xypic}
\usepackage{mathtools}

\begin{document}
$\xymatrix{%
        A\vphantom{\dfrac{A}{B_x}} \ar[r]  \ar@&lt;0ex&gt; `d/8pt[r] `[rr]_s [rr]
        &amp;
        \dfrac{A}{B} \ar[r]
        &amp;
        \dfrac{A}{B}
    }$
\end{document}




The result may not be pleasing due to the big gap on the left. Will be better when just using \frac{}{}. And, you guessed it, it would be nicer with tikz-cd!

5421,5421,8607,Double urn probability and multiple instances,"I've got a probability problem based on the following problem.
I provided some scenarios which I need to solve but I'm thankful for any hints or links on how to solve just one of them or how to described this scenario (and/or solutions) in proper 'mathematical notaion'

The Problem:
An urn contains 10 balls numbered from 1 to 10, every number occurs excactly once.
Person A picks balls from the urne and distributes the balls randomly among 4 other persons, say persons B, C, D and E (it is not neccessary for every person to get the same amount of balls). 
After the distribution process, person C picks $N$ ball(s) from its own urn, which holds another 10 balls, again numbered from 1 to 10.
What is the probability that person C received one or more balls from person A which have the same number as the ball(s) person C just picked from its own urn?

Some scenarios:
Scenario 1: Person C received one ball with nr.7. What is the probability that person C picks the ball with the same number (7) from its own urn?
Scenario 2: Person C received two balls with nr.7 and nr.8. What is the probability that person C picks the same two balls (7 and 8) from its own urn?
Scenario 3: Person C received two balls with nr.7 and nr.8. What is the probability that person C picks one ball from its own urn which number is either 7 or 8?
Scenario 4: Person C received one ball with nr.7. What is the probability that person C picks two balls of its own urn out of which one is ball nr.7?
Scenario 5: Person C received one ball with nr.7 and person D received three other balls, say balls 4, 5 and 6. What is the probability that person C picks one ball from its own urn which number is either 4, 5, 6 or 7? (Person C and person D are merged, they count as one)
",froua,https://math.stackexchange.com/users/230518,"For the general question, assuming picks are without replacement:


for each numbered ball picked by C from their own urn, the probability C did not get that numbered ball from A is $\displaystyle \frac34$ (i.e. it went to B, D or E),

the probability of at least one match is $\displaystyle 1-\left(\frac34\right)^N$ and 
the probability of $n$ matches is $\displaystyle {N \choose n}\frac{3^{N-n}}{4^N}$. 


For the scenarios the numbered balls received by C from A are determined by the scenario, so:


if C picks one from ten balls, the probability it is number $7$ is $\dfrac{1}{10}$
if C picks two from ten balls, the probability they are numbers $7$  and $8$ is $\dfrac{1}{45}$
if C picks two from ten balls, the probability exactly one is number $7$  or $8$ is $\dfrac{16}{45}$, and the probability at least one is number $7$  or $8$ is $\dfrac{17}{45}$

287,287,463,Does this C++ static analysis rule make sense as is?,"I'm implementing some C++ static analysis rules, and one of them prohibits a function from returning a reference or pointer to a reference parameter of the function, i.e. the following are all non-compliant:

int *f(int&amp; x) { return &amp;x; } // #1
const int *g(const int&amp; x) { return &amp;x; } // #2
int&amp; h(int&amp; x) { return x; } // #3
const int&amp; m(const int&amp; x) { return x; } // #4


The justification given for this is that ""It is implementation-defined behaviour whether the reference parameter is a temporary object or a reference to the parameter.""

I'm puzzled by this, however, because stream operators in C++ are written in this way, e.g.

std::ostream&amp; operator&lt;&lt;(std::ostream&amp; os, const X&amp; x) {
    //...
    return os;
}


I think I'm pretty confident that stream operators in C++ do not in general exhibit implementation-defined behaviour, so what's going on?

According to my understanding as it is at present, I would expect #1 and #3 to be well-defined, on the basis that temporaries cannot be bound to non-const references, so int&amp; x refers to a real object that has lifetime beyond the scope of the function, hence returning a pointer or reference to that object is fine. I would expect #2 to be dodgy, because a temporary could have been bound to const int&amp; x, in which case trying to take its address would seem a bad plan. I'm not sure about #4 - my gut feeling is that that's also potentially dodgy, but I'm not sure. In particular, I'm not clear on what would happen in the following case:

const int&amp; m(const int&amp; x) { return x; }
//...
const int&amp; r = m(23);

",Stuart Golodetz,https://stackoverflow.com/users/499449,"As you say, #1 and #3 are fine (though #1 is arguably bad style).

#4 is dodgy for the same reason #2 is; it allows propagating a const reference to a temporary past its lifetime.

Let's check:

#include &lt;iostream&gt;

struct C {
  C() { std::cout &lt;&lt; ""C()\n""; }
  ~C() { std::cout &lt;&lt; ""~C()\n""; }

  What should I do when Ubuntu freezes?  




I've just tried to install ubuntu 12.04 dual boot OS with Windows 7 and it finished installing in ubuntu. However, it said that the bootloader ""grub.."" failed to install. The same exact problem here I receive the error &#39;grub-install /dev/sda failed&#39; while attempting to install Ubuntu as the computer&#39;s only OS. . When I tried to restart my computer, it went to the hp screen since my computer is a dv6 hp laptop and then it goes into this black screen with no words or any buttons will work.

if (!sema) {


Failure in mmap will return MAP_FAILED, not NULL (usually I think MAP_FAILED expands to -1 cast to a pointer, meaning your failure check won't work).

As for style: This is just an opinion, but I think your style could benefit from the concept of a ""cleanup block"".

For example, instead of this kind of style [paraphrasing your code, not doing literal quotes]:

sema = mmap(/* ... */);

if (sema == MAP_FAILED)
{
   exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
}

foo = malloc(sizeof(*foo));
if (!foo)
{
   exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
}


You could do something like:

   int status = EXIT_FAILURE;
   sem_t *sema = NULL;
   struct foo *foo = NULL;

   sema = mmap(/* ... */);

   if (sema == MAP_FAILED)
   {
      goto cleanup;
   }

   foo = malloc(sizeof(*foo));
   if (!foo)
   {
      goto cleanup;
   }

   // TODO: do stuff with sema and foo

   // mark success
   status = EXIT_SUCCESS;

cleanup:
   if (sema &amp;&amp; sema != MAP_FAILED)
      munmap(sema, /* ... */);
   if (foo)
      free(foo);

   return status;


The benefit to this kind of style is that you can add any type of allocation you want (in between the other stuff, before it, after it, whatever), and you just need to add a quick line or two in the cleanup block, and suddenly, all success and failure paths get the resources freed.  If any of the intermediate steps fail and you wind up in the cleanup block, you can be assured that you're not leaking anything, and it won't feel repetitive to make that happen.

There are other variants of this, for example if you or someone you're working with has some religious objection to goto (even though it's the cleanest way to do error handling in plain C), on the slightly more repetitive side you could repeatedly check status to see that you're still succeeding:

int status = EXIT_SUCCESS;
sem_t *sema = NULL;
struct foo *foo = NULL;

if (status == EXIT_SUCCESS)
{
   sema = mmap(/* ... */);

   if (sema == MAP_FAILED)
   {
      status = EXIT_FAILURE;
   }
}

if (status == EXIT_SUCCESS)
{
   foo = malloc(sizeof(*foo));
   if (!foo)
   {
      status = EXIT_FAILURE;
   }
}

if (status == EXIT_SUCCESS)
{
   // TODO: do stuff with sema and foo
}

if (sema &amp;&amp; sema != MAP_FAILED)
   munmap(sema, /* ... */);
if (foo)

I appreciate your feedback on my ability to improve the C style. Generally speaking, due to all the error checking, I find the program stream hard to read, but I don't find a better way to write it. It also breaks the rule of ""maximum value of each function on a vertical screen"", but I don't have a logical method to divide it into functions.","One thing to note:

sem_t *sema = mmap(NULL, sizeof(sema), 
         PROT_READ |PROT_WRITE,MAP_SHARED|MAP_ANONYMOUS, -1, 0);
if (!sema) {


Failure in mmap will return MAP_FAILED, not NULL (usually I think MAP_FAILED expands to -1 cast to a pointer, meaning your failure check won't work).

As for style: This is just an opinion, but I think your style could benefit from the concept of a ""cleanup block"".

For example, instead of this kind of style [paraphrasing your code, not doing literal quotes]:

sema = mmap(/* ... */);

if (sema == MAP_FAILED)
{
   exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
}

foo = malloc(sizeof(*foo));
if (!foo)
{
   exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
}


You could do something like:

   int status = EXIT_FAILURE;
   sem_t *sema = NULL;
   struct foo *foo = NULL;

   sema = mmap(/* ... */);

   if (sema == MAP_FAILED)
   {
      goto cleanup;
   }

   foo = malloc(sizeof(*foo));
   if (!foo)
   {
      goto cleanup;
   }

   // TODO: do stuff with sema and foo

   // mark success
   status = EXIT_SUCCESS;

cleanup:
   if (sema &amp;&amp; sema != MAP_FAILED)
      munmap(sema, /* ... */);
   if (foo)
      free(foo);

   return status;


The benefit to this kind of style is that you can add any type of allocation you want (in between the other stuff, before it, after it, whatever), and you just need to add a quick line or two in the cleanup block, and suddenly, all success and failure paths get the resources freed.  If any of the intermediate steps fail and you wind up in the cleanup block, you can be assured that you're not leaking anything, and it won't feel repetitive to make that happen.

There are other variants of this, for example if you or someone you're working with has some religious objection to goto (even though it's the cleanest way to do error handling in plain C), on the slightly more repetitive side you could repeatedly check status to see that you're still succeeding:

int status = EXIT_SUCCESS;
sem_t *sema = NULL;
struct foo *foo = NULL;

if (status == EXIT_SUCCESS)
{
   sema = mmap(/* ... */);

   if (sema == MAP_FAILED)
   {
      status = EXIT_FAILURE;
   }
}

if (status == EXIT_SUCCESS)
{
   foo = malloc(sizeof(*foo));
   if (!foo)
   {
      status = EXIT_FAILURE;
   }
}

if (status == EXIT_SUCCESS)
{
   // TODO: do stuff with sema and foo
}

if (sema &amp;&amp; sema != MAP_FAILED)
   munmap(sema, /* ... */);

2606,2606,4148,Invariance of dynamical system under a transformation,"I have come across an interesting property of a dynamical system, being transformed by a map, but i haven't been able to figure out why this is happening (for quite some time now actually). Any help is greatly appreciated. Here goes then:

Let M be a n-D manifold and $\dot x=F(x)u_1, F\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times m}, x \in \mathbb{R}^{n}, u_1 \in \mathbb{R}^{m}$ be a control system evolving on M (F is the system matrix i.e. state transition function, and $u_1$ is the input of the system. For all practical purposes $u_1$ is an m-vector from an input space $\mathbb{R}^{m}$). Now let $x=\Psi (y)$ be a coordinate change on M and $u_2=M(y)u_1$ a transformation of the input $u_1$ of the first system. By applying these maps on the system, you get the new equations  $\dot y=F(y)u_2$. As you may notice, F is the same in both systems. The problem is why is this happening i.e. for what systems and transformations does this property hold?

A little more elaboration

It is useful to investigate the maps more closely. In the general case one has

$\dot x=D\Psi \dot y$
$\dot x= F(x)u_1$

thus
$\dot y=D\Psi ^{-1} F(x)u_1$, (1)

where $D\Psi$ is the Jacobian matrix of $\Psi$. In our case it actually turns out that:  

$\dot y=F(y)M(y)u_1$. (2)

You can then consider that $u_2=M(y)u_1$ and get the final system,

$\dot y=F(y)u_2$,

that is, the same system.
 By (1),(2) you get,

$D\Psi ^{-1} F(x)u_1=F(y)M(y)u_1 \Rightarrow (D\Psi ^{-1} F(x)-F(y)M(y))u_1=0$. 

Since this holds for every $u_1$, you have the condition,

$F(\Psi (y))=D\Psi F(y)M(y)$

So, what does this condition imply? What systems F and maps $\Psi$ hold this property (of system invariance)? I should note that F is nonlinear and a case study where this actually happens is the kinematic model of a unicycle robot i.e. this. Any ideas?

  Technically, Calibri, Cambria, etc. are ""modern fonts"", but I hardly ever see those online. What fonts are considered ""modern"" in the context of web design?
  
  What are the characteristics of a ""modern design""? Conversely what

For reference, here is the latest iteration of my design. Does it still look ""dated""? If so, what elements give that impression?





I think I am starting to get a better idea of what ""modern web design"" is:


No or light gradients
Sans serif typefaces
Light drop shadows
Good page hierarchy / directing visitor's attention


Is there anything else that makes a design look ""modern""? 

I have implemented the most of the recommendations in the answers, and I feel it has improved the design a lot. (Never mind the logo - will figure that one out later) 



Am I still stuck in the past? Or am I finally getting somewhere?



Implementing all recommendations, this is what I get:


It's obviously much better, but is it up to modern standards yet? If not, can it get there without changing massively the layout? 



The learning process never ends, does it? Assume that the central menu has a lava effect and that hopefully I can get a decent photo of myself shot to replace that one.



Looking at the various versions, I can see the design improving by leaps and bounds. Not sure how much further it needs to improve to reach professional standards, but it's certainly moving in the right direction.

3582,3582,5723,Does syncing more Google accounts decrease a phone's battery life?,"I recently got a Motorola Moto G (4.3 upgraded to 4.4.2), and I wasn't getting the battery life that my vendor claimed I would get (Through mixed usage: 2-3 hours of music, some web browsing, a lot of Whatsapp, a little bit of gaming, and Wifi/mobile network completely turned off in the night (for some 8-9 hours), I barely touch 20 hours of battery life)

I was wondering whether this has got to do with the 3 google accounts that I've kept in sync for GMail and some other Google services.

I may be a bit paranoid because my previous Android phone suffered from woeful battery near the end of its life, but still I would like to know if syncing more accounts drains the battery more or not.
",wrahool,https://android.stackexchange.com/users/55059,"Short answer: yes and no.

Using three accounts won't run the battery down in itself: by far the bigger factor is how much activity there is. To take an example, Gmail uses push messages (via Google Cloud Messaging, GCM) to notify your phone of new mail, so the phone doesn't have to repeatedly poll the server for new messages for each account.

Because of this, adding a new account that never gets any email will have hardly any effect on battery use. OTOH, doubling the amount of email you get will have a much bigger effect, because GCM is waking up your phone twice as often. While adding a new account makes little difference on its own, you're probably adding the account because it's going to get mail, so you will end up using the battery more.

The same applies to other services too. Even for anything that does poll instead of using GCM, Android is clever enough to do all the polling tasks at the same time, to avoid repeatedly waking up your phone. This means that checking two accounts uses a little more battery than checking one, but less than twice as much: again, the amount of work it's doing each update (how much data it's fetching) is a bigger factor.

To address your particular situation, I'd guess that the background updates on your phone aren't using nearly as much battery as the foreground things you're doing. Don't forget you check the battery use of each app in the device settings.

1031,1031,1622,Analytical solution to PDE,"I am trying to solve the following linear pde where $u=f(x,y)$ in the domain $y \in  (0,\infty)$: 
$$y\dfrac{\partial{u}}{\partial x} = \dfrac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2}$$
with boundary conditions: 
$$u(x,0)=\sin(x) $$ 
$$\lim_{y \rightarrow \infty} u(x,y) = 0 .$$

Can someone please suggest how do I proceed to get the analytical solution for this equation? 



Solution: 

Using method of separation of variables, 
we assume solution to be of the form: $$u(x,y)=X(x).Y(y) $$
Inserting this to the pde, we get: 
$$yX'Y=XY'' $$
$$\dfrac{X'}{X}=\dfrac{Y''}{yY}=-\lambda$$
Now we get the following ode's 
$$X'+\lambda X=0 $$
$$Y'' + \lambda y Y = 0 $$

from which we get two general solutions of the following form: 
$$X(x) = c_1\exp(-\lambda x) \qquad Y(y) = c_2Ai(\lambda^{1/3} y) + c_3Bi(\lambda^{1/3} y)  $$ where $Ai$ and $Bi $ are Airy's functions and the general solution can be expressed as: 
$$u(x,y) =  c_1\exp(-\lambda x).(c_2Ai(\lambda^{1/3} y) + c_3Bi(\lambda^{1/3} y))$$

$c_3 \rightarrow 0 $ to satisfy second boundary condition since $Bi(\infty) \rightarrow \infty $ and hence, solution is of the form: 

$$u(x,y) = A \exp(-\lambda x) Ai(\lambda^{1/3} y) $$
Putting $y=0$, 
$$u(x,0) = A\exp(-\lambda x).\dfrac{1}{3^{2/3}}\Gamma({2/3}) = \sin(x) $$

How should I now proceed to find $A$ and $\lambda$, considering that $\lambda$ needs to be positive real value?
",Sidhha,https://math.stackexchange.com/users/78911,"Hint:  I have not solved the whole problem but I will give the approach:

$f_{yy} - yf_{x} = 0$

Let $f = X_{x}.Y_{y}$

Then $X.Y^{''} - yY.X^{'} = 0$

$X.Y^{''} = yY.X^{'}$

$\frac{Y^{''}}{yY} = \frac{X^{'}}{X} = -\lambda$

${Y^{''}} + y\lambda Y = 0$

${X^{'}} + \lambda X = 0$

These are two ODEs in Y and X

Boundary Values are Y(0) = 0 and $\lim$ ( y tending to infinity) $Y(y) = 0$

X(x) = 0 is trivial so just leave it.

Boundary Values are used to find the general solution and the initial value is used to find the particular solution.

Initial Value f(x,0) = sin(x)

The method that I have used can be more generally summarized as follows

The Method of Separation of Variables: 


Separate the PDE into ODEs of one independent variable each. 
Rewrite the boundary conditions so they associate with only one of 
the variables. 
One of the ODEs is a part of a two-point boundary value problem. 
Solve this problem for its eigenvalues and eigenfunctions. 
Solve the other ODE. 
Multiply the results from steps (2) and (3)

5973,5973,9471,Is it better for a beginner to start with black and white photography?,"I'm quite a beginner in photography with no real experience in visual art. I became interested in it about 10 months ago. 

I inferred from the literature to avoid color photography for 2 to 3 years, or until I have a strong feeling for composition. 

It seems reasonable that first you should know to spot your interest in subject and express it on final print, a task in which colors may confuse a beginner. Besides I'm afraid that with no skill of actual seeing and analyzing I may end up with ugly oversaturated and dull images. Is there a professional opinion on subject, or I'm just inventing limitations of my own?

4477,4477,7100,"Is possible to remote mount an image, that can boot and install itself?","I have a remote server, which runs Linux. I would like to install remotely the OS image, in case that it gets corrupted (this has already happened twice while I am experimenting with the OS).

So far, the only way that I have, is to physically go to the machine location and use a USB disk to mount the OS and the BIOS see it, so it can boot from it.

Is there any way to basically connect to the machine via ssh, attach this image and have it act like it would be on a virtual drive on Windows (like daemon tools for example), so it would persist to a reboot and allow me to install remotely the OS?

I was looking at solutions on Google, but I found something mentioning PXE boot....which sounds complicated, since you need a server and such, and it is not as simple as mounting an image and being done with it.

Beyond that, I found nothing useful, so I am quite short on options....does anyone know how to accomplish this?
",rataplan,https://unix.stackexchange.com/users/119523,"Here's a hypothetical situation which I consider might be plausible:


The targeted machine is EFI.
grub is either never installed on the target or has been utterly wiped from the system.


it can only ever interfere and offers nothing of value otherwise.



So what we might do in the above case is configure a boot option for a small installation/rescue image we keep on our /esp or EFI system partition.

If anything were ever to go wrong with our current installation, then, for so long as we can at least access the EFI system partition by some means, then we can interface our firmware and set the machine to boot to our recovery image on next reboot. In that case all we would have to do is change a text file or two, cross our fingers and run reboot now.

Here is a basic set of commands for a minimally configured Arch Linux (because it's what I use) system which could still do as I describe.


First, we'll make a work directory and download some files.


I use aria2c here. I recommend it, but use whatever works.
I unzip rEFInd with 7za but the same
tool preference is yours in all cases here.
If you're not reading this within a few hours/days of my posting it, then there is a very good chance that the links used below are not current.

mkdir /tmp/work &amp;&amp; cd /tmp/work || exit
aria2c  'magnet:?xt=urn:btih:331c7fac2e13c251d77521d2dc61976b6fc4a033&amp;dn=archlinux-2015.06.01-dual.iso&amp;tr=udp://tracker.archlinux.org:6969&amp;tr=http://tracker.archlinux.org:6969/announce' \
        'http://iweb.dl.sourceforge.net/project/refind/0.8.7/refind-cd-0.8.7.zip'
7za x ref*.zip; rm ref*zip


Next I'll make an image disk.


I use a file here with loop devices, but you may want to use an actual disk if you want to boot to this from firmware.
In the case of an actual device the fallocate and losetup stuff can be ignored and the actual device names will far more likely
correspond to /dev/sda[12] than /dev/loop0p[12]

fallocate -l4G img


Now I'll partition that disk with the gdisk utility and assign it to a loop device.


This is a scripted shortcut for the options you'd want to feed the program interactively. It will create a GUID partition table and a partition of type EFI-system that spans the first available 750Mib of the target disk and another linux default partition spanning the rest of the disk.


These partitions will be /dev/sda1 and /dev/sda2 respectively if you're using a real disk, which will be /dev/sda rather than ./img. It is usually desirable to add more than one partition for a linux root, which is assumed to be the purpose of /dev/sda2.

printf script or no, the gdisk program is easy to use - and so you might do better to go at it interactively instead. The target disk should not be mounted when it is run, and you'll probably need root rights to write the changes.
As a general rule you can do pretty much whatever you want in that program without any effect until you write - so be sure when you do.
I'll be putting my $TGT in a shell variable. Except for its definition here, which you may want to tailor as necessary, where I use it so can you.

printf %s\\n o y n 1 '' +750M ef00 \
                 n 2 '' '' '' '' w y |
gdisk ./img     &gt;/dev/null
TGT=$(sudo losetup --show -Pf img)p


We'll need a filesystem on the esp, too. It must be FAT.


I give mine the fs label VESP. You should call yours whatever you want.
We'll use the label later in /etc/fstab and another config file - so definitely make it something.
In my opinion you should always label all disks.
If you install an OS to ${TGT}2 now you will of course need a filesystem for it as well.

sudo mkfs.vfat -nVESP ""$TGT""1


And we'll make some mount directories and start extracting the relevant files.

   set     ref     ref*iso         \
        arch    arch*iso        \
        efi     arch/EFI/archiso/efiboot.img
while   [ ""$#"" -gt 0 ]
do      mkdir ""$1"" || exit
        sudo mount ""$2"" ""$1""
        shift 2
done;   mkdir esp

Install rEFInd...


rEFInd is a boot manager - which mostly just offers and populates boot menus.
rEFInd will put its config files on the esp and these can be edited at any time and anyway you like.

sudo ref/install.sh --usedefault ""$TGT""1 &amp;&amp;
sudo umount ref  &amp;&amp; rm -rf ref*


Now we'll mount our esp and get the needed files off of the Arch install disk to get our own live bootable rescue disk.


Most live disks implement a sort of ugly hack to make the flat, unpartitioned iso filesystem look like an acceptable boot device to a UEFI system while still maintaining backwards compatibility w/ BIOS systems.
Arch Linux is no exception.
This ugly hack is that efiboot.img currently mounted on ./efi. It's where we'll find our kernel and initramfs image file. The other ones on the disk (in ./arch/arch/boot) will not work for EFI systems.

sudo sh -ec    &lt;&lt;CONF '
     mount    ""$1"" esp
     cp -ar    efi/EFI/archiso esp/EFI
     cp -ar    arch/arch/*x86* esp/EFI/archiso

You have essentially just installed - from the ground up - a pre-boot rescue environment with a persistent copy-on-write save file (so you might, for example systemctl enable sshd_socket now and the setting would persist in the live system's next boot). The Arch Linux live install media now resides on your system's boot partition and can be called from the boot menu at any time. Of course, you also installed the boot menu manager.


A couple of things about the above should stand out to you:


I use *x86* because I have a 64-bit machine and that glob gets what I need. For a 32-bit installation (but why?) use *686* instead.


What I need, by the way, is a total of only 7 files and approximately 300M.
The live-system's rootfs is the squashed image in esp/EFI/archiso/x86_64/airootfs.sfs.

I specify the disk by label. There are no hints or other such nonsense - the disk is named and so it is easily found. You'll need to substitute in whatever you chose for an esp label instead of VESP.
The copytoram kernel parameter instructs the Arch Linux live init system to copy its rootfs image into a tmpfs before loopmounting it - which frees you actually to access the esp when working in that environment. Most live install systems offer similarly arranged constructs.



Where EFI shines is in its ability to handle a filesystem. On modern computers there is absolutely no need to pack some raw binary and wedge it in between your disk partitions. It astounds me that people still do, when, instead, they could manage and configure their boot environment with simple text files arranged in a regular, everyday directory tree. Above I put the kernel and initramfs in their own named folder in a central tree structure. The EFI - which will take its cues from rEFInd in this case for convenience - will invoke that at boot by pathname because it mounts the esp.

Now all that is left to do is to ensure you understand how to select the system which will actually boot when you need to. Understand - you can boot this right now. You can do it in a virtual machine w/ qemu (you'll need OVMF -pflash firmware) or you can reboot your computer and rEFInd will detect the kernel and pass its pathname to the firmware which will load and execute the Arch Linux live system. When you install a more permanent system on the disk - or several (which you can do right now if you so choose by rebooting to the live disk and performing the installation) - you'll want to keep its kernel and initramfs in the same structure. This is very easily arranged.


If, for example, you were to install a system on a root partition named, for lack of an imagination, root, you'd want to set it up something like this:


mount --bind its particular boot folder over the root /boot path in /etc/fstab.
You'll need two lines in /etc/fstab and to create a mount point in /esp to handle this.

sudo sh -c          &lt;&lt;\FSTAB     '
     [ -d /esp ]    || mkdir /esp
     findmnt   /esp || mount -L ESP /esp
     mkdir -p  /esp/EFI/root
     cp        /boot/kernel binary   \
               /boot/initramfs.img   \
               /esp/EFI/root
     mount -B  /esp/EFI/root /boot
     cat   &gt;&gt;  /etc/fstab
     echo ""$1""&gt;/boot/refind_linux.conf
' -- '""new_menu_item"" ""root=LABEL=root""'
LABEL=ESP       /esp    vfat    defaults        0 2
/esp/EFI/root   /boot   none    bind,defaults   0 0
FSTAB




You only ever have to do anything like that once per installation - and that is assuming you didn't set it up that way in the first place - which is easier because the kernel and initramfs will already be where they belong. Once you've got those lines in /etc/fstab and a minimal config file in /boot/refind_linux.conf you're set for good. You can support as many installations as you like on the same system with the same /esp device and centralize all bootable binaries in the same tree just like that. Different
systems will do things a little differently - Windows takes a little more cajoling to get it to conform, for example - but they will all work.


Ok, the last thing you need to know, as I said before, is how choose the  next booting installation from the filesystem. This is configured in the  file /esp/EFI/BOOT/refind.conf.


You should read this file - it's probably 99% comment and will  tell you all about what you might do with it.
Of course, you don't really have to do anything - by default rEFInd will boot the most recently updated kernel in its scan tree.
But I usually wind up setting the following options:

&lt;&lt;\DEF sudo tee \
       /esp/EFI/BOOT/refind.conf.def
### refind.conf.def
### when renamed to refind.conf this file
### will cause refind to select by default
### the menu item called ""new_menu_item""
### in its /boot/refind_linux.conf
default_selection new_menu_item
### this file will also set the menu timeout
### to only 5 seconds at every boot
timeout 5
### END
DEF

And the rescue file...

&lt;&lt;\RES sudo tee \
       /esp/EFI/BOOT/refind.conf.res
### refind.conf.res
### this one will default to selecting
### the entry named ""arch_iso"" with a
### 10 second timeout
default_selection arch_iso
timeout 10
### END
RES



And so now you can just move them around.
For example, to make the rescue environment definitely boot after you do reboot now...




sudo cp /esp/EFI/BOOT/refind.conf.res \
        /esp/EFI/BOOT/refind.conf



And substitute .def for the .res used above, of course, to go back to default root.

I want to install the operating system image remotely in case it gets corrupted (it happened twice when I tried the operating system).,"Here's a hypothetical situation which I consider might be plausible:


The targeted machine is EFI.
grub is either never installed on the target or has been utterly wiped from the system.


it can only ever interfere and offers nothing of value otherwise.



So what we might do in the above case is configure a boot option for a small installation/rescue image we keep on our /esp or EFI system partition.

If anything were ever to go wrong with our current installation, then, for so long as we can at least access the EFI system partition by some means, then we can interface our firmware and set the machine to boot to our recovery image on next reboot. In that case all we would have to do is change a text file or two, cross our fingers and run reboot now.

Here is a basic set of commands for a minimally configured Arch Linux (because it's what I use) system which could still do as I describe.


First, we'll make a work directory and download some files.


I use aria2c here. I recommend it, but use whatever works.
I unzip rEFInd with 7za but the same
tool preference is yours in all cases here.
If you're not reading this within a few hours/days of my posting it, then there is a very good chance that the links used below are not current.

mkdir /tmp/work &amp;&amp; cd /tmp/work || exit
aria2c  'magnet:?xt=urn:btih:331c7fac2e13c251d77521d2dc61976b6fc4a033&amp;dn=archlinux-2015.06.01-dual.iso&amp;tr=udp://tracker.archlinux.org:6969&amp;tr=http://tracker.archlinux.org:6969/announce' \
        'http://iweb.dl.sourceforge.net/project/refind/0.8.7/refind-cd-0.8.7.zip'
7za x ref*.zip; rm ref*zip


Next I'll make an image disk.


I use a file here with loop devices, but you may want to use an actual disk if you want to boot to this from firmware.
In the case of an actual device the fallocate and losetup stuff can be ignored and the actual device names will far more likely
correspond to /dev/sda[12] than /dev/loop0p[12]

fallocate -l4G img


Now I'll partition that disk with the gdisk utility and assign it to a loop device.


This is a scripted shortcut for the options you'd want to feed the program interactively. It will create a GUID partition table and a partition of type EFI-system that spans the first available 750Mib of the target disk and another linux default partition spanning the rest of the disk.


These partitions will be /dev/sda1 and /dev/sda2 respectively if you're using a real disk, which will be /dev/sda rather than ./img. It is usually desirable to add more than one partition for a linux root, which is assumed to be the purpose of /dev/sda2.

printf script or no, the gdisk program is easy to use - and so you might do better to go at it interactively instead. The target disk should not be mounted when it is run, and you'll probably need root rights to write the changes.
As a general rule you can do pretty much whatever you want in that program without any effect until you write - so be sure when you do.
I'll be putting my $TGT in a shell variable. Except for its definition here, which you may want to tailor as necessary, where I use it so can you.

printf %s\\n o y n 1 '' +750M ef00 \
                 n 2 '' '' '' '' w y |
gdisk ./img     &gt;/dev/null
TGT=$(sudo losetup --show -Pf img)p


We'll need a filesystem on the esp, too. It must be FAT.


I give mine the fs label VESP. You should call yours whatever you want.
We'll use the label later in /etc/fstab and another config file - so definitely make it something.
In my opinion you should always label all disks.
If you install an OS to ${TGT}2 now you will of course need a filesystem for it as well.

sudo mkfs.vfat -nVESP ""$TGT""1


And we'll make some mount directories and start extracting the relevant files.

   set     ref     ref*iso         \
        arch    arch*iso        \
        efi     arch/EFI/archiso/efiboot.img
while   [ ""$#"" -gt 0 ]
do      mkdir ""$1"" || exit
        sudo mount ""$2"" ""$1""
        shift 2
done;   mkdir esp

Install rEFInd...


rEFInd is a boot manager - which mostly just offers and populates boot menus.
rEFInd will put its config files on the esp and these can be edited at any time and anyway you like.

sudo ref/install.sh --usedefault ""$TGT""1 &amp;&amp;
sudo umount ref  &amp;&amp; rm -rf ref*


Now we'll mount our esp and get the needed files off of the Arch install disk to get our own live bootable rescue disk.


Most live disks implement a sort of ugly hack to make the flat, unpartitioned iso filesystem look like an acceptable boot device to a UEFI system while still maintaining backwards compatibility w/ BIOS systems.
Arch Linux is no exception.
This ugly hack is that efiboot.img currently mounted on ./efi. It's where we'll find our kernel and initramfs image file. The other ones on the disk (in ./arch/arch/boot) will not work for EFI systems.

sudo sh -ec    &lt;&lt;CONF '
     mount    ""$1"" esp
     cp -ar    efi/EFI/archiso esp/EFI
     cp -ar    arch/arch/*x86* esp/EFI/archiso
     mkdir     esp/EFI/archiso/cow
     xargs   &gt; esp/EFI/archiso/refind_linux.conf
     umount    efi arch
     rm -rf    efi arch*' -- ""$TGT""1

In this richly illustrated book, a range of accessible examples are used to show how Bayes' rule is actually a natural consequence of commonsense reasoning. Bayes' rule is derived using intuitive graphical representations of probability, and Bayesian analysis is applied to parameter estimation using the MatLab programs provided. The tutorial style of writing, combined with a comprehensive glossary, makes this an ideal primer for the novice who wishes to become familiar with the basic principles of Bayesian analysis.

The tutorial style of writing, combined with a comprehensive glossary, makes this an ideal primer for the novice who wishes to become familiar with the basic principles of Bayesian analysis.

5764,5764,9134,Migration Assistant fails on Ethernet Mavericks-to-Mavericks migration,"I have the following setup and am attempting the use Migration Assistant over Ethernet:


Source machine: Early 2009 24-inch iMac running OS X 10.9 
Destination
machine: Latest MacBook Pro Retina running OS X 10.9
Connection: direct Ethernet cable between machines


When I use Migration assistant following Apple's documentation I pass through the confirmation code step on both machines, and then get as far as the ""Checking Source Machine"" screen on the destination, and am stuck there for about 10 minutes, at which point the destination machine jumps back to the language selection setup page, and the source machine says ""This machine is attempting to reconnect to your other Mac"".

At this point I'm at a dead end: Attempting to proceed through the setup again on the destination gets me nowhere, and the only option on the source machine is ""Cancel Transfer"", which quits Migration Assistant there and ends the whole process.

On the source machine I've turned off LittleSnitch, which I normally have running, turned off Apple's firewall, and enabled file sharing.

What am I missing? Are there other settings somewhere that I need to check? I've also tried using FireWire to connect my machines, but have a different set of issues there.

3236,3236,5159,So gravity turns things round,"It makes sense, since gravity tends to push the surface of a body towards it's center. Unless I'm mistaken, everything with mass has it's own gravity, every atom and for instance, our own bodies should also have their own gravity.

  It makes sense, since gravity tends to push the surface of a body towards it's center


Yes, gravity tends to pull towards the center of mass. I think you're comparing human body to celestial bodies - for instance, stars. Stars collapse within themselves after their lifetime because, their internal (thermal) pressure is not sufficient enough to sustain the gravitational collapse.


  How strong is our own gravitational pull? I know it must be extremely weak, but is there actually anything at all that gets attracted to us, like, maybe, bacteria or molecules?


Yes, it's extremely weak. The constant $G$ is already making the situation very weak. When you mention bacteria or molecule, you are actually reducing the effect further due to their mass. Gravity doesn't depend upon the size. Only MASS matters here. As nitrogen is around us mostly, you can calculate the force between you and a single nitrogen molecule at a distance of an angstrom, which is barely about $F\simeq 10^{-15}\text N$.


  What size would a human body have to reach in order for him to collapse into a sphere?


Wiki has a nice quote on gravitational collapse:


  Because gravity is comparatively weak compared to other fundamental forces, gravitational collapse is usually associated with very massive bodies or collections of bodies, such as stars (including collapsed stars such as supernovae, neutron stars and black holes) and massive collections of stars such as globular clusters and galaxies.


Human body is very small compared to any celestial object (just like the size of an atom in a large city). So, you'd probably need the size of some bigger (massive) celestial object to have a significant effect on the gravitational collapse.

3667,3667,5849,Euclid's Algorithm (Greatest Common Divisor),"According to Donald Knuth in ""The Art Of Computer Programming"", the following is how to find the greatest common divisor of two positive numbers, m and n, using Euclid's Algorithm.


  
  Divide m by n and let r be the remainder.
  If r is 0, n is the answer; if r is not 0, continue to step 3.
  Set m = n and n = r. Go back to step 1.
  


Below is my implementation of this algorithm.

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int greatestCommonDivisor(int m, int n)
{
    int r;

    /* Check For Proper Input */
    if((m == 0) || (n == 0))
        return 0;
    else if((m &lt; 0) || (n &lt; 0))
        return -1;

    do
    {
        r = m % n;
        if(r == 0)
            break;
        m = n;
        n = r;
    }
    while(true);

    return n;
}

int main(void)
{
    int num1 = 600, num2 = 120;
    int gcd = greatestCommonDivisor(num1, num2); 

    printf(""The GCD of %d and %d is %d\n"", num1, num2, gcd);

    getchar();
    return 0;
}


Though it appears to work just fine, it doesn't seem to be as elegant as I'd like, especially in the do-while loop.  Also, the while(true) seems dangerous, though I'm pretty confident that r will be reduced to 0 eventually and we'll break out of the loop.

Do you have any suggestions on either making the code more elegant or robust?

2915,2915,4639,How can I model a human who gets powers from a part-time symbiote alien?,"I had an idea for a Mutants and Masterminds (2e) character based on a video game character idea of mine: a Gestalt consisting of a human male and a smaller, roughly cat-sized alien symbiote. As a Gestalt, the symbiote could provide augmentations for the human by fusing its body mass with various regions of the human's body (i.e. arms for strength or reach, legs for speed and jump height, forming wings on his back for gliding), but due to its small size, it can only provide one benefit at a time, but can take an action to switch what benefit it is providing. 

Individually though, things work differently; the human doesn't have any powers of his own (except maybe above-average physical stats as a side effect of his little friend) while the symbiote not only has small size and shapeshifting abilities, but also can bond with and control other humans to aid and protect his owner, though it cannot provide the same augmentations as when it is bonded to its owner.

I am aware there are powers available for this concept to work, I'm just wondering if the whole ""human without powers + small non-human with powers"" joint combo could be done within the game's rules. Is it possible, and if not, what would I need to change?
",Cobalt,https://rpg.stackexchange.com/users/4492,"It's totally possible and a player did it in one of my game. The challenge with Gestalt is the ""Duration: Sustained"" part. You get KO? Your symbiote is kicked out or something. You can buy extras to make this continuous if you like. Just remember that gestalt is meant to represent two creatures (or more) of equal power level that together creates a single more powerful being. So if you play in a 150 PP campaign, your human and your symbiote would have 75 PP each etc. It's possible but I think there are simpler approach.

What my player did was to think about it the other way around. Why not play an alien with mind control on contact? So he played the alien and used the Boost power to increase a mundane guy and took powers (like super-strength, super-speed, strike etc.) with flaw that requires him to be physically attached to a body to function. A mix of flaws and drawbacks and you're good to go.

If you want your symbiote to be able to control other bodies and use them to protect the main host, you can use mind control on other guys here's what I suggest: Summon.

344,344,549,Adding Properties to User Profile and Displaying in List,"I have a site that I am migrating to WordPress, and I have a need to add properties that each of the users can edit (e.g., Address, City, State, Business Name, etc), along with some properties that Administrators can edit (IsActive, CanEmail) that wouldn't be displayed to the user.  In addition, I need to be able to display the properties in a table (similar to how the plugin, ""Members List"", displays, but with the custom fields displaying as well.

Given these requirements, I had attempted to use a combination of ""Cimy User Extra Fields"" and ""Members List"", but the members list grid did not have an option to display the extra fields created by the other plugin.

How would you recommend I approach this?

EDIT: 

So I guess the crux of my question is, what is the preferred method to add properties to the User?
",Steve Wright,https://wordpress.stackexchange.com/users/1371,"To answer the first part of your question, I have just put my class TTT_User_Profile_Addon on GitHub. The class offers a simple interface to add a field to a profile page. I have added an example for a checkbox subclass and some code to initialize it per functions.php. This works in a plugin too, of course.

There are some build in placeholders, but you can add your own. Separate filters for the markup and input values make extending the class easier.

You can set custom capabilities for showing and saving the fields per constructor call. The whole work is reduced to a simple init function:

add_action( 'init', 'ttt_init_profile_addons' );

/**
 * Registers the extra fields for the user profile editor.
 */
function ttt_init_profile_addons()
{
    $GLOBALS['ttt_show_profile'] = new TTT_User_Profile_Checkbox(
        array (
            'name' =&gt; 'ttt_show_profile'
        ,   'label' =&gt; 'Show a short profile box on my posts.'
        ,   'th' =&gt; ''
        ,   'td' =&gt; '&lt;input type=""checkbox"" name=""%name%"" id=""%id%"" %checked% /&gt; %label%'
        ,   'cap_show' =&gt; 'edit_posts'
        ,   'cap_save' =&gt; 'edit_users'
        )
    );
    // add more fields here …
}


Adding the values to the member table is something I still have on my todo list …

Oh, and I should probably mention another class to replace or extend the default contact fields: TTT_Contactfields. This may be a case of OOP overdone. :)

1142,1142,1791,How can I prevent the intake vent for an on demand water heater from getting plugged?,"We have a Navien on demand water heater. The intake and outlet vent pipes run out through the poured concrete foundation and have a plastic grill on the end.
If the intake vent is blocked in any way the water heater will not turn on as a safety feature.

I have to add another tighter mesh over the intake in the summer or paper wasps build nests inside the pipe.  If I leave the mesh on then in the winter it gets blocked with snow and ice.

I need some sort of vent cover that blocks insects and does not get blocked by snow. Here is a sample with the ""as delivered by the contractor"" on the right and with a crude but workable filter for summer use on the left.



Any ideas? 

Edit: the manufacturer suggests adding a PVC T valve at the end of the outlet.  The number of elbows allowed is governed by the length of the run and number of previous elbows in the run.
I'm going to try a T valve and the filters shown in the answer below.
",kevinsky,https://diy.stackexchange.com/users/18543,"Aside from adding an elbow, one method to allow finer mesh without blocking airflow is to extend the mesh a fair distance - I'll try to get a picture of Something similar, but doubt I can find the exact thing I'll want - basically either a long (12""/30cm or so) mesh tube, or a 12-18"" section of pipe, drilled full of holes, and then wrapped in mesh small enough to keep the wasps out. When you make the mesh smaller, you need more area so that the flow can remain the same (even if some parts are blocked) - so the idea is to greatly increase the area of mesh.

OK, these are fish pond filters, but they have the right idea.



Some car or truck air filters might actually be adaptable to work, too - especially the ""aftermarket high flow"" types (you might ditch the ""foam filter"" those have and just use the ""mesh cage"" part of them) - but that's more if you want something you can buy - you should be able to make something that works out of ordinary hardware cloth mesh.

This array is supposed to be kept separate from the 'active' array, so that the active array can be reset on a button press.

I use self.editContents = [self.cleanEditContents copy]; to set the active array both directly after the clean array is populated and on a button press.

There is a problem where even though I reset the array and call reloadData and setNeedsLayout (overkill? probably), the numbers don't reset. I tried outputting the values of the same position in both arrays and it turns out that any changes made to the active array contaminate the clean array.
",JamEngulfer,https://stackoverflow.com/users/1375665,"It sounds like you expected a deep copy.

The copy method does a shallow copy, that is it just makes a copy of the array and not of the items in the array.

So when you do [self.cleanEditContents copy] the new array shares exactly the same items as the original.

1363,1363,2145,Why does my bike make a noise when I pedal hard?,"When I pedal forcing a little with my right leg, the bike makes a noise that I don't know how to describe. I'll try to do it. It's like:


a short ""ting""
a tiny bell
if a small rock hits the down tube


I don't know what is causing this noise, but I think that it could be any of this things:


pedal
crank arm/pedal connection
crankset


I think the material of all these things is alluminium.

I don't feel anything (like a bad shifted chain) when I hear the noise.

It happens when there is movement and when there is NO movement (I use the brake, so the bike doesn'e move, stand using all weight on right pedal, and it makes the noise)

The pedals could be in any position, It is not in a particular position. Just pressing the right pedal.

Has someone else has this ""problem""? Any ideas of where this comes from?

Update:
Yesterday I took out the chain and stood on the right pedal, and made the noise. Then is not the chain, nor the transmission system.

I put oil in the pedal axis, but had no luck. Also tried to loose the pedal, but the juncture point is too tight, and I couldn't.

Today I will try to use oil in the bottom bracket.

Update: here is a link to info on the bike http://www.diamondback.com/2012-sorrento maybe it helps to know the model of all the components.

We have no control over the client's choice of hardware or OS, and for the first time we've been given Windows 7 Embedded to work with.  Suddenly, our secure writes have started failing if power is lost immediately after the flush.

Although including commode.obj causes fflush to commit, even on Win7, I've always preferred to use the MS-specific commit mode flag (""c"") on Windows (the Linux version uses a completely different method), because as I write the library not the products, I can never be sure that commode.obj has actually been included, so I can't throw an error.

FILE* p_f = fopen(""foo.dat"", ""wbc"");

Your code is very intimidating - it is filled with single letter variable and members (s,h,e,d...). Those which are not single letter are generic and unhelpful (temp, buffer, notamount...). This makes your code very unreadable.

You also use a lot of literal numbers (2, 256, 1072632447, 60801...) which make no sense to a person who is not familiar with your algorithm. Use constants to make your code more readable.

Your comments are also not useful for someone to read and understand your code.

If you want a serious code review, you must make your code readable, break large methods (operate) into smaller ones, etc.

764,764,1207,Silicone caulk for shower and tub?,"I am about to seal the gap between my tub and the wall tile with caulk (it was originally grout which cracked so I chiseled out what I could). I was planning to use silicone caulk (GE II), but a contractor suggested that pure silicone is not ideal since all caulk will eventually need to be removed and replaced and silicone is very difficult to remove. There's some logic to this, so I'm wondering - is he right? If so, what kind of caulk should I use?

43,43,64,Discontinuity at the edge of Chebychev window,"I am using Chebychev window for its narrow main lobe. The problem of chebychev window is that it has discontinuities at the edge, and it seems that Taylor window solves this issue.

",Thinium,https://dsp.stackexchange.com/users/16093,"A little Googling came up with this reference, which indicates that the impulse response for a Taylor window is:

$$
h[n] = 1 + 2 \sum_{m=1}^{\tilde{n}-1} F_m \cos\left(\frac{2\pi m}{N} \left(n-\frac{N}{2}+\frac{1}{2}\right)\right)
$$

$\tilde{n}$ is a parameter for controlling how many equal-height sidelobes there are in the window. $F_m$ is a parameter that is related to the maximum sidelobe height; the references given in Matt L's answer give more detail on how it is calculated.

5771,5771,9147,Opamp Voltage Doubler Unstable (After Extended Operation),"I've been working on a circuit which would drive an industry standard pneumatic regulator (E/P transducer).  The transducer takes a standard 0-10V command signal with a typical input impedance of 6.5 kOhms.  The DAC that I've selected (ADI 12bit 8 channel) has an internal 2.5V reference and can output 0-5V.  

After researching extensively, an opamp voltage doubler seemed like a good fit.  This worked and was rock solid for about two weeks, but failed after a ~2 day period of continuous operation without warning.  Now the opamp output is close to a correct 2.0 gain but constantly fluctuates as if the output is barely stable and poorly damped.  Has anyone ever seen an opamp fail this way?  

We're using a UA7812 linear regulator to supply 12V (from 24V) to the opamp quad (LM324AN) and admittedly it may not be sufficiently heatsinked (gets wicked hot to touch). Still, the 12V supply is solid at 11.83V and voltages supplied by the DAC appear correct and stable.  The actual resistors on the board are 10k with 0.1% accuracy and each measure 9.95k precisely.  Any advice in solving the problem is tremendously appreciated!  It's essential that this be a robust circuit.

Below is our final opamp configuration (and the part number):


",Liquid Plasmas,https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/68582,"Your circuit should work, but there are some things that you should check:

First: Why is your regulator getting hot? Your OpAmp has a supply current of 3mA and the current into your pneumatic regulator should be less than 2mA. Even with your regulator dropping 12V at a worst case current of 10mA that only makes 0.12 Watt of dissipated power on the regulator. It should not get hot from this.

Are you driving any other things with it? 

If not, check why you have a higher current than expected. You'll likely find the culprit if you go down this road.

If you're driving other things with the regulator try a dedicated regulator for the OpAmp to see if the other loads influence the supply. You've mentioned a pneumatic regulator. Is this a inductive load, e.g. a motor of some sort? If so the inductance can do some crazy voltage swings when switched due to inductive kickback. This could be enough to kill the OpAmp over time due to high supply voltage spikes. A beefly flyback diode may be needed to suppress these voltage spikes.

Second: How far away from the OpAmp is the pneumatic regulator? If you have it connected with a long cable you may have a to high capacitive load at the output of your OpAmp. This can lead to instabilities of all sorts.

The sensor adopts standard 0-10V command signal, and the typical input impedance is 6.5kohm. The DAC (ADI 12 bit 8-channel) I selected has an internal 2.5V reference voltage, which can output 0-5V.","Your circuit should work, but there are some things that you should check:

First: Why is your regulator getting hot? Your OpAmp has a supply current of 3mA and the current into your pneumatic regulator should be less than 2mA. Even with your regulator dropping 12V at a worst case current of 10mA that only makes 0.12 Watt of dissipated power on the regulator. It should not get hot from this.

Are you driving any other things with it? 

If not, check why you have a higher current than expected. You'll likely find the culprit if you go down this road.

If you're driving other things with the regulator try a dedicated regulator for the OpAmp to see if the other loads influence the supply. You've mentioned a pneumatic regulator. Is this a inductive load, e.g. a motor of some sort? If so the inductance can do some crazy voltage swings when switched due to inductive kickback. This could be enough to kill the OpAmp over time due to high supply voltage spikes. A beefly flyback diode may be needed to suppress these voltage spikes.

Second: How far away from the OpAmp is the pneumatic regulator? If you have it connected with a long cable you may have a to high capacitive load at the output of your OpAmp. This can lead to instabilities of all sorts. 

Also long cables are excellent at picking up static electricity and may kill your OpAmp via ESD spikes into the output. 

You can prevent most of these problems by adding a series resistor with the output. A simple transistor driver that isolates the OpAmp output from the long cable may also help.

318,318,510,Managed Package and dealing with Standard Objects?,"I want to build a managed packaged and ultimately deploy it on the AppExchange.  My app is targeted for the B2C model (Business to Consumer).

Since in salesforce public contacts are required to be tied to an account, I'm wanting to put a trigger on both the standard Account/Contact objects so that way when a new contact is created I also create a corresponding account and vice-versa (similar to the way the Non-Profit Starter Package) works.  I'm concerned about doing this though as these are standard objects and it seems it could cause some conflicting behavior for customers if I've added a trigger like this on the key standard objects like Accounts and Contacts.

When developing a managed package should I consider creating all custom objects?  I hate to recreate the standard account/contacts, but it seems like it may be my only option if I want to have full flexibility to do what I want and also not affect the way a customer is currently using salesforce Accounts and Contacts.

Does anyone have any thoughts on the impact of building functionality on top of standard objects when creating an appexchange app? It seems like tinkering with the standard objects might be a bad idea?
",West,https://salesforce.stackexchange.com/users/10916,"Create your own Record Type for Accounts and Contacts that will indicate the records are applicable to your managed package. 

Then check if the Account/Contact has the required Record Type before applying the trigger.

I.e. The triggers only make changes if the Account/Contact is of a configured RecordType

This will also help isolate your customizations from any other installed packages that are also working with Account/Contact.

Note: Avoid hardcoding any RecordTypeIds in the trigger. It is better to look them up as required or make them configurable.



If you want your triggers to work for multiple record types you could examine a particular field to see if it indicates the record is applicable. This could be as simple as having a Checkbox on the Account or Contact that indicates your code should be applied to the record.



With triggers I also make it a habit to provide a bypass custom setting. Create a hierarchy checkbox custom setting that indicates if the trigger should be bypassed. Then an admin can configure the custom setting to skip the trigger for certain profiles/users as required. This can be extremely useful when loading data into the system.

3767,3767,5999,Bug in my C code to reverse words in a string,"I was practicing some programming problems and tried to code the popular ""reverse words in a string"" problem. 

I tried to come up with my own code in C. I am able to partially get it right. That is, ""hello world"" becomes ""world olleh"". I am wondering what the bug is here. I think somewhere I am creating an off by 1 bug. 

As much as possible, I wanted to do it without using library functions. I searched here for this problem &amp; found many solutions, but I'd like to know why my solution doesn't work. 

Here is the code:

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;

void reverse(char*, int);

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
    char st[]= ""hello world"";
    int len = strlen(st);
    int i=0,j=0;

    reverse(st,len-1); // Reverse the entire string. hello world =&gt; dlrow olleh

    while(st[j]){ //Loop till end of the string
        if ( *(st+j) == ' ' || *(st+j) == '\0' ) { //if you hit a blank space or the end of the string
            reverse(st+i,j-1); // reverse the string starting at position i till position before the blank space i.e j-1
            i=++j; //new i &amp; j are 1 position to the right of old j
        }
        else {
            j++; //if a chacacter is found, move to next position
        }               
    }       

    printf(""%s"",st);
    return 0;
}

void reverse(char *s, int n)
{
    char *end = s+n; //end is a pointer to an address which is n addresses from the starting address
    char tmp;
    while (end&gt;s)  //perform swap
    {
        tmp = *end;
        *end = *s;
        *s = tmp;

5785,5785,9167,Bash script doesn't catch SIGINT while in read loop,"I have several scripts with while read line loops that don't execute my cleanup function when I press Ctrl C. For example:

stty -echo

When I press Ctrl-C, my terminal is screwed up because the stty -echo setting is still in effect. I have many other scripts where my cleanup function works flawlessly. The only time I seem to have a problem is when I press Ctrl-C while the script is in a read loop. Is there a way to ensure that the cleanup function will get called when Ctrl-C is pressed while the script is inside a read loop? Or am I just missing something obvious here?

Update: There is something else going on in my scripts. I ran the exact script above, and I can't get it to fail the way my other scripts do. I will have to try to distill the broken scripts down to something that I can get to fail, at which point I will update the question.

Update 2: Okay, I figured it out. I was getting an error from stty (which I wasn't seeing because my real cleanup function was also clearing the screen). The error was: stty: standard input: Inappropriate ioctl for device. I looked this up an apparently it was due to calling stty while stdin was redirected from the file /foo/bar.

3578,3578,5718,Proxy.pac myIpAddress() returns local address and not ethernet adapters,"This is kinda a Part two from here.

When clients VPN into my network they get assigned an Ip address which in turn gives them the 252 option from the DHCP. The auto detect then grabs this file

What I need essentially is a way for the proxy.pac to figure out if a client is on a VPN connection so that it can resolve a DIRECT for them. 

So if I do a simple var myIp = myipAddress() and then just have it match it from a list of these fixed addresses then it would be solved. However the myIpAddress() function seems to be picking up the local Ip to the machine (eg: 192.168.10.1) and not the network adapter. In my case that local address is my MS Loopback which is needed for some of my local VMs. If I disable my Loopback adapter it starts resolving the correct address. This is not an ideal workaround.

So how do I go about resolving the Ip address I want from the correct adapter?

3429,3429,5454,Windows Software to Mount Volume/Partition Image File,"Last night I had a BSOD a couple of minutes after moving a file. After a reboot, I found that the file was gone (it was deleted from the source partition and not present on the destination).

I took an image of the source volume (ie from the Boot Sector to the last cluster of the partition). Then I wrote a program to extract the unused clusters from a disk and save them as files.

Some of the free clusters on the original volume have now been overwritten so I need to use the image to do my final extraction. That means I need some software that can mount a volume/partition image, but all of the image mounting software I can find can only mount disk images (ie from the MBR—the master partition table—on).

Does anyone know of (hopefully free) Windows software that can do this?

I’ve already tried (without success): VirtualCloneDrive, DaemonTools, VirtualFloppyDrive (and probably a couple of others I can’t think of). They all either nag that the file is no good, or try to mount it, resulting in a disk that Windows complains has an unknown/corrupt filesystem.

Thanks.

1572,1572,2472,Can a number have both a periodic an a non-periodic representation in a non-integer base?,"Fix an algebraic number $\beta$ and consider a complex number $\alpha$ which admits multiple representations in base $\beta$. If one representation of $\alpha$ is ultimately periodic, must every other representation of $\alpha$ be ultimately periodic?

Bonus question: Does this depend on the choice of the set of digits?

Edit: John Bentin showed that this is false in general, even with $\beta \in \Bbb{Q}$. Is this true at least for $\beta$ algebraic integer?

Edit 2: This question came up when trying to solve this problem of mine.



All I know so far is that if $\beta$ is a Pisot integer, i.e. if it is a real algebraic integer greater than $1$ with every conjugate lying in the unit circle, then $\alpha \in \Bbb{Q}(\beta)$ if and only if it has an ultimately periodic expansion (which is stronger than my question).

48,48,74,Symfony 2 and Twig custom error page,"I give up.

The problem is with the overrided Twig 404 template. It is overrided in a default way by creating an error404.html.twig under the /app/Resources/TwigBundle/views directory.

The template itself does not contain any irregular or complex logic: just a layout with some translated text (|trans) and a menu with several links.

The problem is, that I can't get app.user object (returned as NULL) or current app.request.locale (always returned as default locale) inside this template.

I have even tried to override the twig exception controller and dump a current locale (Request::getLocale()) or get user - the results are the same - default locale and NULL for user.

Then I decided to dig deeper and found a dozens of listeners (locale listeners, exception liteners, ...) and tried to debug/fix/test there, but I didn't proceed any further.

By the way, I have overrided the 500 error page too, and everything is fine there. Well I guess that when 500 error (exception) is thrown, the symfony has already set up user/locale/etc, because it already has got to the target (controller/action) and other listeners been already executed. But 404 error (NotFoundHttpException) is being thrown BEFORE Symfony targets the action...

645,645,1024,How do I create a simple yet complex business layer?,"I'm working with a fairly complex web application. It's split up into the following layers:


Presentation - HTML
Service layer - A REST and SOAP API communicating with the business layer
Business layer - Contains the business logic.
Data access - Provides access to the storage (SQL etc)


The business layers contains classes encapsulating specific areas, such as customer registration, user management and more. The problem we are seeing is that the business layer is starting to get a bit messy. We have a single class handling customer management but as this area of the application grows more and more complex, the class grows and grows and become messy.

For example, we may have the following classes


class CustomerManager


void CreateCustomer(...)
void DeleteCustomer(...)

class UserManager


void CreateUser(..)
void DeleteUser(...) 
void ActivateUser(...)
void InactivateUser(...)
void ResetPassword(...) 



Creating a customer involves creating users as well. So CustomerManager calls misc methods in the UserManager class. As the application has evolved, creating a new customer means roughly 10 different things needs to be done except for registring the customer in the database, such as informing sales, audit logging, configuring default user accounts, creating a default configuration for the customer, notifying end-users of their auto-generated passwords and more. So CustomerManager.CreateCustomer grows to ~100 lines of fairly hairy code.

I'm trying to think of a good way to handle this but am assuming that there's some common good way to do this which I'm simply not aware of.

I've considered creating ""Task""/""Command"" classes implementing small sub-processes and then let the CustomerCreation.CreateCustomer simply execute a set of tasks. I would have more classes but they would each do less things.

I've also considering implementing some kind of global application-level event/plug-in systems where CustomerManager.CreateCustomer just creates the customer in the database and then publishes an event that the customer is created. Plug-ins/something can then subscribe to these events and do stuff such as informing sales and logging the fact. Using this method, I wouldn't have to actually update CustomerManager.CreateCustomer when I want to do more stuff which is something which feels attractive to me.

What obvious design pattern am I missing?

On the other hand, if your logic has a lot of ifs, buts and unless tests in it, then there is no real way to reduce the complexity of the code, because it is inherent in the business rules that the code represents.

4395,4395,6984,How do native speakers 'guess' the pronunciation of the letters in a word they see for the first time?,"I confess! Being a non-native speaker, I struggle a lot especially when I come across a new word. And I wonder how do native speakers pronounce perfectly even though they read the word for the very first time. There should be some rule/technique? I'm not sure.

Let's take a case. 

If I see a word having 'ch' for the very first time, how do I guess it? Remember, I don't have dictionary. Nor do I have access to this great site when I encounter that word. For example, 

Take the word 'chariot'. Being a non-native with quite limited knowledge of orthography, I know that 'ch' is pronounced as in 'Charles'

But then, imagine, I came across the word 'charade'. Undoubtedly, for me, it is 'ch (as in Charles)-re-d-s'. But then, actually, 'ch' there is 'sh' (as in Shane). 

It's not just 'ch' but it goes for 'g' as well. 'G' as in 'goat' or 'g' as in 'gymnastic'. Is there any source that teaches how to pronounce a letter if it is placed after/before certain letter? Is there any such rule? The one I remember is when a word ends with 'mb', you don't pronounce 'b'. 'Bomb', 'Comb', 'Tomb' and many other words ending with 'b'.  



There are a few more words that add another nail in the coffin of my pronunciation complexity! 


  penis (pee, and not as in 'pen')  asthma (no 'th' pronounced)  Dengue (dengeee)  and many more...

",Maulik V,https://ell.stackexchange.com/users/3187,"By analogy with words you already know. In more detail, you guess mainly by recognizing morphemes, taking into account the three main spelling systems that exist within English and taking into account common phonetic pressures that alter pronunciations. Educated guessing cannot be reduced to rules, of course, but I can give you a feel for it with a scattering of examples.

Morphemes

Morphemes are the smallest elements of a word that have a meaning. For example, -ing and -tion are morphemes, as in going and information. If you know a lot of morphemes, you will be good at guessing pronunciation, because morphemes are usually spelled in only one or two ways, and their pronunciation in one word usually works by analogy with their pronunciation in other words. 

For example, if you've seen -tion carrying that meaning in a number of words, you intelligently guess that it's pronounced the same way in a word you've never seen before, such as, say, transubstantiation. By analogy with relation, generation, acceleration, and many similar words, even transmission, which has the other spelling of the morpheme and is preceded by a different vowel, you can reasonably guess that conflagration has the stress on the second a. And you can intelligently guess that informational has the stress on -mā-.

This doesn't give you the correct pronunciation in every single case—equation is slightly different—but this is fundamentally how English spelling and pronunciation work: by analogy with related words, where having the same morpheme is the most important kind of relation.

Etymological spelling

English actually has three main spelling systems, corresponding to its three main root languages: Anglo-Saxon, Latin, and Greek.

Anglo-Saxon

In an Anglo-Saxon word, a vowel needs to be followed by two consonants or a consonant at the end of a word in order to be short. For example, batted vs. bated, chipped vs. griped. You know that mob is /mǒb/, not /mōb/, because of this pattern. In Anglo-Saxon words, it's as if every vowel wants to be long, but gets cut short by a terminal consonant. In Anglo-Saxon words, ch is usually pronounced /tʃ/, the ""native"" pronunciation.

Latin

Not so in words from Latin. Risible is /ˈrĭz.ə.bl/, not /ˈrīz.ə.bl/, and there's really no way to guess that, except perhaps by a rather superficial analogy with divisible and visible. Words from Latin usually follow pretty regular spelling, but in many cases you can't tell whether a morpheme's vowel will be long or short from its spelling—though often you can make a good guess by analogy with other words.

The soft pronunciations of c and g before i and e began in Latin, and were only introduced into English with the Norman invasion. So, Latin-derived words are normally pronounced that way, and most of the exceptions come from Anglo-Saxon, such as get, girl, and together. Anglo-Saxon words like bagged and bagging use the doubled g to indicate that the preceding vowel is short, so the g stays hard. Exaggerate and suggest come from Latin, so you know not to expect their soft g to make a good precedent for Anglo-Saxon words.

Greek

Words from Greek have a distinct spelling system, where English letters correspond to Greek letters: ch stands for the Greek letter χ; ph stands for the Greek letter φ; k stands for the Greek letter κ; th stands for θ; etc. The Greek sounds of these letters are approximated by English phonemes, as in chrysanthemum, metaphor, photon, system, synchronize, autarky, etc. Notice that ch in Greek-derived words is pronounced /k/. Greek consonant clusters that don't occur in English get reduced, as in psychology, bdellium, and pneumonia (but not sphere: we allowed /sf-/ to start a syllable in order to absorb that word). Eu- in Greek words is a morpheme meaning ""good"", and is pronounced /ju-/, as in eulogy and euphemism. Leonhard Euler is German, so you learn not to make an analogy between his name and Greek words. 

The main difficulties with Greek-derived words involve the letters g and y, especially when they occur together. In Greek-derived words, g stands for the Greek letter γ, which we would normally represent in speech with a hard g  as in gynecology and gigabyte, but phonetic pressures and misunderstandings have usually set precedents that make it soft, as in gymnasium and gyroscope. It goes silent when it's part of a reduced, un-English consonant cluster, as in gneiss. In the middle of Greek-derived words, y stands for υ, but at the end, it stands for -εια, which means the same as Anglo-Saxon -ness. The Greek vowel υ doesn't correspond well to any English vowel. Usually it's pronounced as a short /ĭ/, but English phonetic pressures sometimes shape it into a long /ī/, as in hypothesis, psychology, and papyrus. The -gy ending is a morpheme, pronounced /-dʒē/ (unstressed), found in energy, synergy, biology and even analogy, the main concept that explains how English works!

Can you really guess the origin of an unknown word?

You might wonder, ""How am I supposed to guess which language a word came from?"" It's surprisingly easy. Anglo-Saxon, Latin, and Greek words tend to have a very different ""feel"" to them, and the spellings of the words tend to follow patterns that are fairly easy to recognize. Noticing the different styles of words from each main root language is an important part of mastering English, including its huge vocabulary of synonyms. There are, of course, a few  words that picked up spellings by ""false etymology"", such as ache and ptarmigan, but happily, it doesn't matter, because if you guess these words' pronunciations by the usual analogies, you'll be right. These spellings were established by people trying to follow the same analogies.

By the way, roughly 20–30 years ago, many schools stopped teaching children about classical roots and how they're spelled. Consequently, a lot of natives today don't know much about it consciously. So, with this clue, you can learn to do better than a lot of natives! Some kids are still being taught, though, as evidenced by the questions asked in this contest of guessing the spelling of a word (which is harder than guessing the pronunciation from the spelling). Here's an excellent article by an expert on dyslexia, about the true complexity of English spelling and what's involved in learning it. 

Conflicting precedents

Precedents can conflict. For example, you can make a good educated guess about impious by noticing its three morphemes: im-, meaning negation; pi-, meaning reverence or dutifulness, by analogy with pious and piety; and -ous, making an adjective in a Latin style. So, a pretty good guess is to pronounce it /ǐm.ˈpī.əs/. However, impious can also be understood as following the precedent of the Latin word impius. The phonetic pressures in Latin put the stress on the first syllable, and we usually feel the same pressures in English words that come from Latin. In fact, the English word impious, pronounced /ˈǐm.pē.əs/, was borrowed directly from Latin in the 16th century. That pronunciation has been echoed ever since. The -ous spelling in impious is a slightly stretched analogy with Latin borrowings that follow a different pattern. Consequently, both pronunciations are in use today, /ˈǐm.pē.əs/ being more standard. (I prefer /ǐm.ˈpī.əs/, since it communicates the morphemes more clearly. Someone who's never heard it before will easily understand the meaning. /ˈǐmp.ē.əs/ misleadingly echoes imp.)

Pressures

I knew a native speaker who mispronounced fruition as /ˈfru.ʃən/. He was going by analogy with fruit. But /ˈfru.ʃən/ is a somewhat uneducated guess. The correct pronunciation, /fru.ˈǐʃ.ən/, better reflects both the etymology and the pressure from -tion to put stress on the preceding vowel. The spelling of fruit reflects the fact that it can break up when used as a morpheme in a larger word. And we see the same pattern established in circuit/circuitous and other -uit- words.

There is another factor at work here, too, which helps a lot for guessing pronunciations. Experience teaches you that common pressures will likely have removed the second syllable from /ˈfru.ĭt/, but these pressures don't occur in fruition. In English, there's a pressure to merge those last two syllables at the end of a word, as in biscuit, pursuit and circuit. Explaining phonetic pressures is a complex subject, but it's like everything else in English: it works by analogies and precedents, and you get a feel for it from experience. What's relevant here is that the unstressed short vowel has a hard time holding its own against the preceding long, stressed vowel without help from another consonant; the terminal -t offers only very weak support.

The word intuit is the only word of this pattern that has kept that unstressed syllable. I think people continue to pronounce it because the words intuitive and intuition are much more common, so when people use the unusual verb intuit, they feel some pressure to echo the corresponding syllable in the familiar words in order to be understood. I have heard people attempt /ǐn.ˈtut/, independently inventing the word during conversation, and then draw back from it because it sounds weird and doesn't clearly indicate the connection with intuition. There is also pressure to avoid echoing the slightly silly verb ""toot"".

Since pronunciation is shaped by interaction between many pressures, if you pay attention to those pressures, you are in a good position to guess the pronunciations of unknown words.

Analogies, not rules

Some people harp on the fact that English spelling doesn't follow rules, as if this were proof that English is ""illogical"" or completely without order. Really, though, the English language works like English common law: by precedents, not rules. When deciding new cases, or when inventing new words, people try to be consistent with previous cases or with the spellings of words already in the language. Old cases and familiar words can't pre-decide every aspect of a new case, of course. Law and language accumulate over the centuries, one case and one word at a time, embodying subtlety and hopefully wisdom beyond what could be captured by any fully articulated system of rules.

As you get to know the language better, you can often guess pronunciation from spelling pretty accurately, especially with ""big"" words. When I was in the 2nd grade (age 7), I was given a test where I had to guess the pronunciations of a long list of words, up to ""college level"". I got nearly all of them right, despite not knowing, at that age, anything about etymological spelling—and despite not having encountered most of the words before. I could usually see some sort of analogy with a word I already knew, and I made an educated guess. That's how it works.

The moral of all this is that you should not memorize rules. You should not even memorize the few rules that happen to be true. Memorizing rules runs against the spirit of the language. What you should do is make analogies from specific words to specific words that you already know how to pronounce. Occasionally you'll guess wrong—and that will teach you a new precedent, which you will apply in new situations. Eventually, gradually, you learn to perceive English spellings with acuity. (You can probably guess that it's /ə.ˈcju.ĭ.tē/, despite the spelling's ambiguity, because of its congruity with annuity and gratuity.)

My idea now is to see the progress of the download in the tableview cell. I set up a uiprogressview on every cell, which is hidden on default. I now want to see the progress bar when I start the download. How can I do that? 

I tried something with performSelectorOnMainThread and a selector, which change the progress of my selected cell(which I assign in the main tableview). Seems to be a bad idea - didnt work.

Some ideas how to do that?



EDIT2: Some piece of code of my solution, ATTENTION! This is not the real code, I deleted a lot of lines for inserting here. There arent all releases etc. I think the solution is really dirty, but I didnt found a better solution for me...

Some important things:


cellDownloading: Array which knows
every cell which is downloading at
the moment
progressDictionary: Knows the progress of every cell
cellDictionary: Knows every cell, filled up in the cellsForRowAtIndexpath delegte of the tableview

After that I can click on one cell and a detailview is loaded(xib file, loaded through code in the main tableview). On the detailview I can click a download button and some files are downloaded asynchron to the documents folder. Then I pop the view down and I see again my tableview.

My idea now is to see the progress of the download in the tableview cell. I set up a uiprogressview on every cell, which is hidden on default. I now want to see the progress bar when I start the download. How can I do that? 

I tried something with performSelectorOnMainThread and a selector, which change the progress of my selected cell(which I assign in the main tableview). Seems to be a bad idea - didnt work.

Some ideas how to do that?



EDIT2: Some piece of code of my solution, ATTENTION! This is not the real code, I deleted a lot of lines for inserting here. There arent all releases etc. I think the solution is really dirty, but I didnt found a better solution for me...

Some important things:


cellDownloading: Array which knows
every cell which is downloading at
the moment
progressDictionary: Knows the progress of every cell
cellDictionary: Knows every cell, filled up in the cellsForRowAtIndexpath delegte of the tableview


I also cant copy the whole code, because there is a lot which have nothing to do with the whole process, but I give you the important steps.
My cells are created through parsing a xml, so every cell has got a setId in my case.

",Sam,https://judaism.stackexchange.com/users/9,"First of all, being a doctor and healing the sick is not considered a Malacha (work on Shabbos). It is considered a Chachma, a gift, not a trade. See Rambam Hichos Refuah.

There is a fantastic Steera (contradiction) found in the Rambam which points this out. In Hilchos Shabbos, the Rambam holds that one is prohibited from carrying an amulet, since (medically speaking) they are of no use. However, in Hilchos Refuah, Rambam states that one can use (carry) an amulet since the ill person believes in this amulet (an amulet must be considered Mumcha, one which has been proven by healing the sick already), and healing is 60% in the mind, therefore the ill will be healed. As you can hear, the Rambam didn't sound like he was in favor of using tricks or the like. But if it works, any port in the storm!

Next question, is one allowed to transgress the Shabbos to heal a Goy? Technically no. However the Chachamim stressed that if they knew this they would kill us, therefore it is in our best interest to heal them (""משום איבה""). I fear to add this but Halacha is just that.

So, can one heal an animal on Shabbos? Basically no. However, one can make the animal comfortable until a doctor can administer to the animal. There is a wonderful book Sefer Tsar Balay Chaim by R' Itchak Nachman Eshkoli written in the last 10 years which deals with anything &amp; everything to do with animal suffering. My son-in-law used this while writing a paper on Feeding Animals on Shabbos while in YU. I highly recommend this sefer to anyone who has an animal, especially since Tzar Balay Chaim is a Torah Issur and it is important to know what one can or shouldn't do.

2130,2130,3393,Understanding the frequency scale of a spectrogram,"The graph below was derived from a raw seismogram recorded during an earthquake over a timespan from t=0 to t=1400 seconds (not shown on x-axis). 


The original seismogram $s(t)$ is not shown, but it is known that the original signal is the convolution between the source wave $w(t)$, the effects of the medium $g(t)$, and the effects from instrument itself $i(t)$; that is,  

$$s(t)=w(t)*g(t)*i(t)$$

The graph above is what remains after removing the instrument response as shown below:  



I think this instrument response is telling me that the amplitudes of the original seismogram $s(t)$ at frequencies higher than $0.02Hz$ were amplified at a constant gain of approximately $1E9$, while amplitudes lower than $0.01Hz$ are effectively dampened (by gains significantly smaller than at those frequencies higher than $0.02Hz$).

But what exactly can I effectively say about the shape of the original seismogram from this information?  If these frequencies are 'dampened' in the broadband representation above, what, if anything, can be said about the amplitudes and shapes observed in the original graph?  Can I simply say that longer waves should be present in the original signal but not say anything about when they occur?  Could I somehow convolve these graphs to generate the original signal (or at least closely approximate it)?
",Paul,https://dsp.stackexchange.com/users/1330,"I think what you're saying is that you have a linear, time invariant (LTI) system model for both the propagation medium and the response of the measurement instrument itself. Given that you know the (at least approximate) magnitude response of the instrument, you would like to best estimate what the actual signal at the instrument's input looked like.

This is similar to the process of equalization used in communications systems. Since you have some knowledge of the system (in this case characterized by the impulse response $i(t)$ or the frequency response plot that you showed), you can attempt to undo the effects on the signal that are imposed by the measurement instrument. More generally, this type of operation is known as deconvolution: given an output of a convolution and optionally knowledge of one of the inputs to the convolution, one would like to calculate the other input. In this case, one of the convolution inputs is $i(t)$ and the output is the measurements reported by your instrument. 

It appears that you don't know the exact impulse response of the measurement device, only its magnitude response. This isn't enough information in itself to execute the deconvolution, so you'll need to make some assumptions about the phase response of the instrument in order to move forward with that approach. This is a very powerful technique, however; as the Wikipedia article notes, the approach can be used to compensate for the effects of the seismic propagation medium also (since it's also modeled as a convolution with an impulse response), potentially allowing you to gain more insight as to the original seismic event.

Edit: And, as to your questions about how you're interpreting the plot, your understanding seems correct. The system has a highpass characteristic with a flat passband starting at approximately $0.02\ \text{Hz}$, with the magnitude response decreasing by a factor of 10 per decade of frequency below $0.02\ \text{Hz}$.

1661,1661,2627,Why all the dice?,"I'm asking more as an outside observer, and not with anyone who has any grievance with how games are played, nor am I judging or criticizing anything.

I've just always wondered, why use all the different types of dice? Why a 4 sided die for one thing, three 6 sided dice for another, and a twenty sided dice for something else? Couldn't you use, just for example, two 10 sided dice to represent a percentage between 1 and 100 (one die is tens and the other is ones, and they're differentiated by colour), and then use that for all instances?

If you needed to decide something was a one in four possibility, you just declare it a 25% chance, and roll the two tens. No matter what kind of possibility you wanted that are currently represented by various combinations of dice, it seems to me you could represent it within a range of one to one hundred. 

Sure, a bag of all different shaped dice looks kind of cool, but is there a reason for them that goes beyond aesthetics? With just two 10 sided dice (or three if you wanted really fine gradients of percentage) wouldn't that make things simpler and more consistent without losing any of the variety of chances taken?

I thought maybe it had to do with probabilistic outcomes. For instance, if you roll two 6 sided dice, I believe that you're more likely to come up with some combination that adds up to 7 than you are with a combination that adds up to 2 or 12. So there's a bell curve of possible outcomes. Nonetheless, maybe I'm just not well versed enough in probabilities enough to see a difference, but I still think you could get the same equivalent likelihoods of an outcome by using a straight percentage, adjusting up or down depending on what you needed.

Again, I'm not trying to be contrarian, I'm just curious. Is there an objective reason for all the different dice?
",Questioner,https://rpg.stackexchange.com/users/10772,"Short answer: Yes, your hunch is right: because probability curves, and easy access to them.

21,21,29,Does this statement make any sense?,"I am asking this question completely out of curiosity. The other day, my roommate, by mistake, used 'Light year' as a unit of time instead of distance. When I corrected him (pedantic, much), he said the following:

""Units are relative. And according to Fourier Transforms, units can be changed so Light year is a unit of time.""

That got me thinking and I read up Fourier Transforms on wikipedia but couldn't find anything about using a unit in one domain as a unit for another measurement. I do agree that units (particularly, base units are relative. eg: the meter), but does his statement make any sense?

EDIT
Thank you everyone for all the answers. It isn't so much to in it in or prove a point as it is to understand the concept better. Anyways this is his response after I showed him this thread. Any comments would be appreciated.

His response:
Nevermind, for the first time I accept I was wrong. BUT using lightyears to measure time is possible. My example didn't make sense bacause I was wrong when I meantioned that I'm still measuring dist. If you have a signal in time domain and ...take the FT, I get a signal which DOES NOT HAVE to be in frequency domain. Clarify this to the guy who posted last. Now the new signal is in a domain defined by me and so is its units. This signal although not equal to the original signal, still represents that if ya take an inverse FT. So, the idea of time will still be there. Now coming back to our case: lightyears here is not the lightyears you are used to read when dealing with distance. It represents time.
",xbonez,https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/436,"This doesn't make much sense: light year is in any case a unit of distance.

What is common is to use ""reduced units"", for examples units where $c=1$ (speed of light) or $h=2\pi$. But in these cases the opposite would happen: you would say ""year"" to mean a distance. Or for example you say ""has a mass of xyz MeV"" instead of ""$MeV/c^2$"".



About the Fourier transform: this allow to go from the so-called ""time domain"" (even if ""time"" is not always the usual time) to the ""frequency domain"" involving ... frequencies.

But as you can see this cannot change the definition of light-year.

What does these percentage mean? What is the equivalent of it in the metric system? 

Will 75% worn state affect my cogwheels also? Can I replace the chain to a new one without changing the drivetrain's other elements?

",kisp,https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/users/13937,"The .75 is not 75% worn per se.
A chain checker measures chain stretch.
Chain stretch is an indicator or wear-and-tear.
Parts of a drive train wear at different rates. For instance the teeth of the chainset will show wear when they become ""shark-finned"". But this could be long after the point at which you should replace a worn chain.
If you persist in using a worn chain - though you may not notice anything detrimental - but when the chain eventually gives up - and you put a new chain on - you may find it skipping under load through the gears. This requires replacement of chain-rings / cassettes.
An earlier replacement sought - would have prolonged the life of chain-rings / cassettes.

As for your last question - it is difficult to say - if you ask a manufacturer - they will say no difference. Personally, I think the wider chains lasted longer and are stronger than the narrower 10/11 speed chains of today.

Don't know of any exceptional single-speed chains ... just keep it well oiled and it will last longer.

1487,1487,2338,"Does following ""musical forms"" suppress ""creativity""?","I'm not a professional musician (actually, I'm a computer programmer), but I'm playing Guitar and Recorder, and I also sometimes write some themes coming to my mind.

Thus, let's assume that I'm a little novice composer. Now, when a theme comes to my mind (or a simple motif), I start developing it, based on my intuition, and based on my sensational analysis. I only extend it, the way it sounds good to me. In other words, I don't follow any kind of musical form to extend (I can't find a better word for it) my theme into a more complete piece. 

On the other hand, when I give the extended song to my close friends, or my wife, or people close to me, they might like it, only based on its aesthetic value, not based on its musical and technical analysis. In other words, they say like ""oh, it's beautiful"".

However, when I try to put my song in a musical form, and to my opinion, make a highly technical piece, I feel that it looses its beauty (of course, IMO), and people around me say ""the way before it was more beautiful"". 

Now, I have a question. Should we follow musical forms? Why we have to confine ourselves to musical form at all? Isn't it true that we only create music, because of its aesthetic value? Does following form suppresses creativity in art, which in turn suppresses beauty and ingenuity of our work of arts?
",Saeed Neamati,https://music.stackexchange.com/users/925,"If you're not following any existing form, it becomes encumbant on you to construct the form anew. Without form, you'll have real difficulty making the song listenable beyond a certain length. It's the same with programming. Beyond a few thousand lines, the lack of structure makes the entire enterprise unweildy.

So it is very useful to learn how to follow this or that form, so you can steal little bits of structure.

Eg. I had a little guitar riff that was very catchy. You could speed it up, slow it down, add drones, lead lines. But I could not, for the life of me, make it go anywhere. When I finally began to wonder why, theory showed the way. The riff was essentially a 2-measure chord progression: I / / / | V / / /. I couldn't start a new phrase (bridge/chorus/anything ""different but the same"") on V because I was already there. So I had to steal pieces from other forms: deceptive cadence or ""sitting"" on I the last time round (of some binary repetitions) [this one actually makes the ""new phrase on V"" possible]. 

On the otherhand, it can be very interesting to start out following a form, and then radically depart from it. So you will find it useful to be aware of forms, so you can make conscious choices about when to follow, when to lead.

I feel the word dimensionless is actually wrong and should be replaced by ""of dimension number"". For example, the Mach number is of dimension one. 

Many people write, for this case: 


  Mach-Number | Dimension: ""-"" | Unit: ""1""


As mentioned before, I would say 'Dimension: ""1""' in this place. But what about the unit? $\text m/\text s$ divided by $\text m/\text s$ is equal to one. But is the number one a unit by definition? Or should one say that the Mach number has no unit and therefore 'Unit: ""-""'?

996,996,1573,Why is CuSO4 used as electrolyte while purifying copper?,"During the electrolytic purification of copper, the electrolyte is taken as copper(II) sulphate ($\ce{CuSO_4}$). Is there any particular reason for this? Could another salt of copper, say $\ce{CuCl_2}$ work?

I mean, I don't see any reason why it shouldn't. The only difference will be, that at the anode chlorine instead of oxygen will be evolved, which doesn't seem to be such a big thing. 

Why, then, is $\ce{CuSO_4}$ preferred?  
",Gerard,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/users/1888,"During copper electrorefining, impure $\ce{Cu}$ from the anode is oxidized and dissolved, while $\ce{Cu^2+}$ is reduced at the cathode, forming the deposit of refined copper. Because anodic impurities which are less noble than copper – most notably $\ce{Ni}$, $\ce{As}$ and $\ce{Sb}$ – also dissolve in the electrolyte, the cell voltage is kept in the range of 0.2-0.4 V to avoid co-deposition of these metals at the cathode. 

Copper dissolution is the main oxidation half-reaction at the anode, and the oxidation of anions from the electrolyte needs to be minimized, since it is an unwanted side reaction which reduces current efficiency of the process. In a $\ce{CuSO4}$ electrolyte, this would be oxidation of $\ce{OH-}$ (from water dissociation, so concentration will be low) to $\ce{O2}$, while in a $\ce{CuCl2}$ solution, $\ce{Cl-}$ will be oxidized to chlorine gas, which would present a greater hazard because of its toxicity.

The electric conductivity of the electrolyte is another important factor, which varies with different copper salts and their concentrations. $\ce{CuCl2}$ and $\ce{CuSO4}$ are both readily soluble in water; however, the relative molar conductivities of these solutions will be different.

Now, a normal leased line might be worth looking into.  But, if you're in an area with that much outlay already, you can probably get 50Mbps cable; try it out first and see if it's inadequate before you spring for crazy upgrades.

I recently took up Mobile Automation task and hence am completely new  to Appium. I am working with Appium 1.2.0.1 on Windows 7 and trying to automate the native Android Browser(not Chrome or an App) on an Android v4.3 real device.

You can't build them on industrial scale (to put it somewhat insensitively, OCP didn't have a ready supply of highly trained and freshly killed police officers)

So, Robocop seemed like a prototype that could never have entered production. Total waste of R&amp;D money.
And having a police brain (because he already know police procedure) seems not necessary since at the same time OCP could build fully AI robots (from robot chicken, flawed as it was, in Robocop 1, to Ninja Androids in Robocop 3).

I'm sure every city mayor would like to have one or two of them on their police departments.

Also... he's a prototype. The I+D research is a continual loop where you evolve your product, getting better functionalities with each iteration and cutting down construction costs.

337,337,537,How to find a co-working space in Lille as a tourist?,"In a few weeks time, I'm hopefully going to be spending a few days in and around Lille, some working, some holiday. For the working part, I'd need somewhere to go in the day, ideally some sort of co-working space or similar. 

In Paris, there's an excellent co-working space La Cantine (as mentioned in this question). Regus have an office by the station which includes a business lounge, which in theory ought to be all I need. Unfortunately, the time I tried going there, it was very noisy with lots of people having meetings there (which I've not really found elsewhere), and the wifi was so bad you longed for when an IDBus would park outside so you could use theirs...

Are there any good co-working spaces that'd welcome a visiting tourist for half a day or a day? (Googling found places with a 1+week minimum commitment, which aren't really suitable for me as a tourist just wanting something like half a day or a day). Or failing that, are there any good places (cafes/libraries/etc) I could look at going to?
",Gagravarr,https://travel.stackexchange.com/users/26,"From the website of La Cantine in Paris, I found a map of coworking places in France. There happen to be at least 2 having a website in Lille. Both have an open space and coffee room with at least one meeting room.

Co-factory only targets regular coming people apparently, starting at 49 euros for 4 days, but they offer a one-day trial if you email them.

5709,5709,9048,"When turning a corner my rear wheel touches the brake pad, is this normal?","I replaced my brake pads about a week ago and today I noticed that, when turning (or generally under lateral force), the rim touches one of the brake pads (depending on which way I'm turning.

I hadn't noticed it before but today was the first wet day so maybe the sound was louder because of this.

I don't notice myself slowing down at all, but don't really want to be unnecessarily wearing down my brakes.

The brakes aren't super close when released, maybe 2-3mm on each side.

I would expect a certain amount of flex in the wheel, but as I built the wheel myself I just wanted to check that this wasn't a problem with my build (though its already done 1000 miles probably so it cant be too bad!)

There would be room to widen the brakes slightly if this is all that might be required.

When stationary and holding the wheel and applying lateral force manually I can make the rim touch either brake pad without a great deal of effort.

Any input appreciated

Thanks!

public class MainActivity extends Activity {
  static final int NOTIFICATION_ID = 1;

  @Override
  public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    setContentView(R.layout.main);

    button.setOnClickListener(buttonOnClick);
  }

    @Override
    public void onClick(View v) {
      String ns = Context.NOTIFICATION_SERVICE;
      NotificationManager mNotificationManager = (NotificationManager) getSystemService(ns);

      Notification notification = new Notification(R.drawable.icon, ""Hello"", System.currentTimeMillis());

      Intent notificationIntent = new Intent(MainActivity.this, MainActivity.class);
      PendingIntent contentIntent = PendingIntent.getActivity(MainActivity.this, 0, notificationIntent, 0);

      notification.setLatestEventInfo(context, contentTitle, contentText, contentIntent);

      mNotificationManager.notify(NOTIFICATION_ID, notification);
    }
  };
}


But as I said, it doesn't work the way I want it to; instead it just blinks in regular green with the default delay, and not the one I have set in my code.

Can anyone see what is wrong with my code, or know if I have to do something else to achieve this?

Why is this happening? And is there a way to prevent it from happening? I thought ext4 was meant to be resistant to fragmentation. Instead I find that it immediately fragments a solitary file when all the rest of the volume is unused. This seems to be worse than both FAT32 and NTFS.
",EmmaV,https://unix.stackexchange.com/users/85900,"3 or 4 fragments in a 900mb file is very good.  Fragmentation becomes a problem when a file of that size has more like 100+ fragments.  It isn't uncommon for fat or ntfs to fragment such a file into several hundred pieces.

You generally won't see better than that at least on older ext4 filesystems because the maximum size of a block group is 128 MB, and so every 128 MB the contiguous space is broken by a few blocks for the allocation bitmaps and inode tables for the next block group.  A more recent ext4 feature called flex_bg allows packing a number of ( typically 16 ) block groups' worth of these tables together, leaving longer runs of allocatable blocks but depending on your distribution and what version of e2fsprogs was used to format it, this option may not have been used.

2287,2287,3644,"New to circuits, confused about where reset happens with SR flip-flop","In one of my classes we are learning about circuits. For homework, we have to create a finite state machine for a vending machine using an SR flip-flop. The machine can either take a nickel, dime, or nothing until it gets to at least 15 cents, so it has 4 states (0, 5, 10, and 15 cents). Once the machine receives 15 cents, it dispenses its product. Once in this state, if nothing is deposited it goes to the 0 state; if a nickel is deposited it goes to the 5 cent state; if a dime is deposited, it does to the 10 cent state. 

The truth table that I came up with is:

Present|Inputs| Next  |        | SR Flip Flop

Based on this truth table [and the k-maps I made from it], I created the following logic gates:


My question is, where exactly does the ""reset"" happen? For example, if I am in the 15 cent state and deposit a nickel, how does it go to the 5 cent stage? Do I have to make the output from ""open"" loop around? Sorry for such a novice question, I hope that made sense!

Edit: The first two columns are for the present state of the machine, i.e., how much you have deposited so far. So Q0 Q1 = 00 represents the first state (0 cents), Q0 Q1 = 01 represents the second state (5 cents), etc. The next two columns represent adding a nickel or dime. If you are in the state 00 and and 01, you should move to state 01. Since you cannot deposit a nickel and dime simultaneously, we don't care about the the input 11. If you are in state 10 and add 10, you go to state 11 (and don't get any change back!).
",A D,https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/8855,"The reset, given the truth table you provided, happens just because the state 11 of the state machine is mapped in the state 00; in fact, if you look at the outputs, both states have the same next state, so if the inputs are 00 (buffer), from the state 11 it will go to 00.

An optimization of the machine would use the Mealy topology, where you map the state 11 in 00 just changing the output if coming from an activating sequence.

1879,1879,2982,Make *Buffer List* always appear in horizontal split,"I know Emacs tries to be intellectual and opens its helper buffers depending on which dimension of the window is bigger, so it may appear in vertical split window if current width is bigger than height, and in horizontal split otherwise.

2312,2312,3688,Responding to players paying exclusively with gold coins,"I noticed that my players would pay everything in gold. A simple piece of bread? 1 copper. ""Here, have a gold and keep the change."" They get into a tavern. A beer! Here, have a gold coin and keep the change. They would give beggars gold coins like they are candies. They make a donation to the church. 10gp. That's a stupid amount of money in fiction. But for them that's nothing. They always spend their money on the most expensive stuff in the tavern and would request the inn keeper to open the most expensive bottle of elven wine he has and the players will pay 3 times the price of that bottle. Why? We're rich we don't care!

Most of the time, NPC will have never seen a gold coin in their life. A inn keeper maybe. A farmer, forget about that. My players don't really think about the social and economical consequences of that and I'd like that to change.

First, I have no idea how I should have my NPCs react except having them jump like they won the lottery. That would just encourage the players to continue. I want them to understand this is weird, unusual and almost out of character. I don't want to punish them, I want them to understand that would be the equivalent of donating 25,000$ to the girl at Starbucks.

Second, how would the setting change? Suddenly there's this town where the PCs are spending money like they don't know what to do with it. And as a matter of fact..they frequently don't. In my settings there are no Magic weapon Wal-Mart. Magic items are special and you can't simply buy them in a random village.

Edit: Assuming I'm playing in D&amp;D 3.5 (which is not the case but it's irrelevant anyway because the system is not important. I play in a D&amp;D 3.5-ish setting). Also assume I follow the recommended money-per-level table. I couldn't find the D&amp;D one but the one for Pathfinder is similar. I usually don't give them the equivalent of the loot in money. I split the loot like this: 75% of the loot in item and the rest in a mix of coins and random objects.

How many times have you heard/read about movie stars or athletes that spend tons of money on non-essential items.

Here's a few outcomes of PC's spending money like water:

Other addresses will be handled programmatically: they'll kick off various tasks, get logged, etc. These addresses should either kick off a process to the handle the email addresses, or should store in an easily processable format.
It should also be fairly easily configurable with domain keys, spf, and anything else it takes to allow email deliverability.

894,894,1418,What to do in case of low inter-rater reliability (ICC)?,"Background: Eight doctors each rated the same 54 patients on a persuasiveness measure (1-7 Likert scale). The mean score on the persuasiveness measure will eventually be the outcome measure of my experiment. 

Inter-rater reliability was quantified as the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), using the two-way random effects model with consistency. Unfortunately, the inter-rater reliability of the eight doctors was low (ICC = .350, single measures). Should I still run further planned analyses with these unreliable data? Or can it possibly be justified that I only include the doctors (i.e., raters) with the highest inter-rater reliability? I found out there are two doctors with a more acceptable inter-rater reliability (ICC = .718, N = 2), but I don't think this is enough reason to exclude the other doctors from analyses. I would really appreciate any references to literature that deals with this problem.
",Leau,https://stats.stackexchange.com/users/5718,"I'd rather answer on the grounds of the methodology itself, rather than how to ""fix"" the situation.  In another context, I assisted in working on a ratings and classification system, and found that inter-rater agreement was disappointingly low.  Two paths were considered


Change how rating agreements were defined and identify those who seemed to ""understand"" the task, or
Refine the definitions used, along with the guidance and examples provider to raters, so that they could more easily understand how to rate things.


In the first sceneario, the whole methodology and results could be rendered a waste simply because the inter-rater reliability was low.  It indicated that either the original definitions were bad or that the raters were given poor instructions.  If I proceeded along that path, I was sure to have problems.

In the second case, the agreement between raters was very good.  Since they rated quite a lot of items, they could also give feedback with when they thought the original definitions and guidance were inadequate.  In the end, the methodology was very reproducible.

Based on that, I would not yet modify your set of raters, but return to the original definitions and guidance.  Any tinkering after the rating is a problem, though it can be useful as a quality check.  There are sometimes raters that are going to do what they want, no matter the guidance given.  With good statistical methods, it is easy to identify them and weight their contributions appropriately.

Now, if I'm mistaken and you don't plan to do further collection, i.e. your data is already collected and done, what you may do is PCA or something like it, and see if you can get a sense of how the different doctors (or patients) cluster.

5939,5939,9411,Appcache for dynamic site,"I am trying to use HTML5 Appcache to speed up my web-mobile app by caching images and css/JS files. The app is based on dynamic web pages.

As already known – when using Appcache the calling html page is always cached -> bad for dynamic websites.

My solution - Create a first static page and in this page call the manifest file (manifest=""cache.appcache"") and load all my cached content.  Then when the user is redirected to another dynamic page the resources will already be available. (Of course this second dynamic page will not have the manifest tag).
The problem is that if the second page is refreshed by the user, the resources are not loaded from the cache; they are loaded directly from the server!

This solution is very similar to using an Iframe on the first dynamic file. I found that the Iframe solution have the exact same problem.

Is there any solution for that? Can Appcache really be used with dynamic content?
Thanks

Now the problem is that the appcache won't cache each individual admin/page/... unless you visit it.

What I did was use the offline page to represent these pages that you may want to allow a user to access offline.

The JS in the offline page looks up the URI and scrapes it to find out which page it should show and fetches the data from localStorage which was populated with all the page data when the user visited the admin dashboard before being presented with the links to each individual page.

4913,4913,7822,Configuring a tftp server for multiple clients,"I am using a tftp server to hold the boot image for a dev board and the dev board is hard-coded to look at a particular IP address for the server.  This all works fine.  What I want to do now is be able to set up a second dev board to look at the same IP address for the server, but get a different boot image.  I would like to do this by having the tftp server use a different root directory based on the IP address of the client connecting to it.  Is there a way to do this?

I realize there may be some way to do this with iptables, but I have to turn the firewall on the server machine off entirely for other reasons, so that may not be terribly practical.

For reference, I'm using Fedora 15 for the server, but that can be changed if need be.
",JonS,https://unix.stackexchange.com/users/47279,"DHCPD or not?

You don't say but I'm assuming that you have some PXE configuration file that this DEV board is setup to look for. Typically you'd tell the DHCP clients what PXE image to use like so via a DCHP server:

subnet 192.168.0.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
        range 192.168.0.10 192.168.0.49;
        option subnet-mask 255.255.255.0;
        option broadcast-address 192.168.0.255;
        option routers 192.168.0.1;
        filename ""pxelinux.0"";
        next-server 192.168.0.100;
}


The TFTP server would be the next-server 192.168.0.100, and the file to load would be filename ""pxelinux.0"". But since you don't have this setup your DEV board is looking for a the ""next-server"" at a specific IP address, I'm going to assume that it's looking for a specific PXE file too.

Using PXELINUX

This solution would assume you have control over pointing the DEV board at a particular ""filename"", in this case I'm suggesting you use PXELINUX, the file would be pxelinux.0.

PXELINUX allows you to have custom images based on a system's MAC address is the more typical way to do it, since system generally don't have an actual IP address assigned to them in a static way, whereas the MAC addresses are static.

Setup

On the TFTP server's root directory you'd then create something like this:

/mybootdir/pxelinux.cfg/01-88-99-aa-bb-cc-dd
/mybootdir/pxelinux.cfg/01-88-99-00-11-22-33
/mybootdir/pxelinux.cfg/default


Each MAC address above is a file with the appropriate boot stanza in it for each system. Here's mine from my Cobbler setup:

$ ls -l /tftpboot/pxelinux.cfg/
total 88
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 292 Jul  9  2012 01-54-52-00-05-5a-ab
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 288 Jul  9  2012 01-54-52-00-17-a6-cd

4020,4020,6417,Postfix or exim: Automated/Programmatic and forwarded email setup,"I'm looking to replace our current use of an external smtp provider with an in-house installation. It should handle the following situations:


Certain addresses should be forwarded to gmail addresses; we'd like to continue to use gmail as our primary email interface.
Other addresses should be available as pop/imap mailboxes.
Other addresses will be handled programmatically: they'll kick off various tasks, get logged, etc. These addresses should either kick off a process to the handle the email addresses, or should store in an easily processable format.
It should also be fairly easily configurable with domain keys, spf, and anything else it takes to allow email deliverability.


I've used sendmail in the distant past. It seems postfix and exim are the recommended options these days. My main question is: what's the best choice and setup for the forwarding of the addresses to gmail, and for the programmatic access? Is procmail still the way to go or are there better options these days?

We're using linux/ubuntu servers.
",Parand,https://serverfault.com/users/6162,"for the programmatic stuff, you have to be aware of what UID the programs/scripts will be run as.

For postfix, for example, scripts run from /etc/aliases (or any other root-owned aliases file) will be run as the 'nobody' user.  

postfix has the ability to have multiple aliases files and (here's the good part) programs run from an aliases file will be run as the user who owns that file (except for root - as mentioned before, aliases files owned by root are run as nobody).

if you ever need to run a script from mail as root, then the easiest way (if you have sudo installed) is to configure sudo to allow 'nobody' to run it as root without a password and run it from a wrapper script that runs it with sudo.

NOTE: whenever triggering scripts from mail, you have to remember that the data (i.e. the mail) is from an untrusted source (the internet)....so it is extremely unsafe to use the data from either the body or the header as arguments to commands executed by the script.  this is basically the same issue as trusting user-supplied data in a CGI script - just don't do it.  e.g. consider what a badly written script could do if the user-supplied data was something like "" ... innocuousdatahere ...; rm -rf /"".  you might think it would be easy to check for obvious things like semi-colons and strip them out, but there's a lot of non-obvious things you'd need to check for as well and you'd just be setting yourself up for a failure since you're unlikely to think of or catch them all.  far safer to eliminate the security risk entirely by just not trusting user supplied data ever.

this is important no matter what UID the script will run as but is especially important when/if it is being run as root.

Finally, to answer one of your direct questions, procmail is still a useful tool for what you want to do.  as is maildrop and other similar programs.  think of procmail etc as specialised tools for parsing body and headers to make decisions about what to do, so you don't have to have all that parsing code in your scripts.  write your script to be just do its job, and use procmail to decide when the script should be run.  for example, you could create a new user called, say, 'mailjobs' which has its own home dir and .procmailrc file.  then create aliases that forward mail to that user.  mailjobs' .procmailrc would then check the X-Original-To header to decide which script(s) to run.

276,276,442,Why did they choose Barabbas?,"John 19:38 - 40 (NLT)


  38 “What is truth?” Pilate asked. Then he went out again to the people
  and told them, “He is not guilty of any crime. 39 But you have a
  custom of asking me to release one prisoner each year at Passover.
  Would you like me to release this ‘King of the Jews’?”
  
  40 But they shouted back, “No! Not this man. We want Barabbas!”
  (Barabbas was a revolutionary.)


Why were they so messed up that they would choose the rebellious, murderous Barabbas over the innocent Son of God?
",Andrew,https://christianity.stackexchange.com/users/65,"Mark 15:7-15


  7 And among the rebels in prison, who had committed murder in the insurrection, there was a man called Barabbas. 8 And the crowd came up and began to ask Pilate to do as he usually did for them. 9 And he answered them, saying, “Do you want me to release for you the King of the Jews?” 10 For he perceived that pit was out of envy that the chief priests had delivered him up. 11 But the chief priests stirred up the crowd to have him release for them Barabbas instead. 12 And Pilate again said to them, “Then what shall I do with the man you call the King of the Jews?” 13 And they cried out again, “Crucify him.” 14 And Pilate said to them, “Why, what evil has he done?” But they shouted all the more, “Crucify him.” 15 So Pilate, wishing to satisfy the crowd, released for them Barabbas, and having scourged Jesus, he delivered him to be crucified.


As Mark's version of this event emphasizes, the crowd was driven to cry for Barabbas by the chief priests who were at the root of the push to have Jesus killed. Why would they choose Barabbas as their alternative to prevent Jesus' release? The biggest factor, of course, is that Jesus was a problem for them - he spoke against them repeatedly, criticized their teaching and their ways, and taught many things that contradicted what they taught. 

But on the specifics of why the chief priests would choose Barabbas, I think there's a pretty easy answer to reason out, even if the Bible doesn't explicitly detail it. Barabbas, as John mentions, was a revolutionary. That meant he was trouble, but not for the chief priests. He was trouble for the Romans. He wanted to resist Roman occupation and authority in the name of Jewish freedom. It's not hard to get an oppressed people to cheer for someone who wants to end their oppression. This would have been a win-win in the eyes of the chief priests, because they were getting rid of a man who threatened to compromise their authority in exchange for a man who threatened to compromise the authority of their oppressors.

For many users, GIS means ESRI ArcGIS.  While expensive in a commercial setting, they have rather generous educational licensing, including the provision of free copies to educators for distribution to students, one per licensed seat per year.  I would advise at least ticking this box; I don't think people who learned GIS in other ways are less capable, but they might be less employable given the keyword-filtering resumes go through these days.  The extensions to ArcGIS range from basic things that should be integrated into the main application to the amusingly archaic to essential tools for a certain niche.

The OSGeo stack is an obvious addition to this, but I don't think it's yet capable of being a full replacement in desktop GIS, at least not with the usability of Arc.  Due to constant complaining about ESRI's annoyances, I tried to replace it for an entire summer with mostly QGIS, and failed.  QGIS w/ plugins + GRASS + POSTGIS can be hacked around to achieve a lot of GIS functionality, I can believe that, but for learning GIS rapidly, I wouldn't recommend it.  There are a lot of different projects under the OSGeo heading, though - in all likelihood you'll find use for some of them even if you don't touch the desktop functionality.

I'm always seeing MapInfo installations mentioned, but the one I used wasn't really mature / feature-ful in the same sense ArcGIS has been.  The user interface was lacking, so perhaps it just hid the functionality from me.

Manifold has been highly regarded as an ArcGIS competitor that is at once commercially affordable, comprehensive, and extensively higher-performance than the sometimes antiquated ArcGIS code.  They seem to be dragging their feet on updates &amp; bug-fixes in the last few years, though.  At the least, if ArcGIS fails to operate on extreme datasets, try this.

RS

Remote sensing software is its own niche, with lots of features that aren't present in the ESRI stack.  I've been exposed to ERDAS, and heard about ENVI and PCI.  Those three constitute a majority share, but I'm aware that there are a decent number of options out there, some open source (I've heard good things about Opticks).  In my own research area, 3D remote sensing is rapidly becoming a thing, as well - LIDAR and automated photogrammetry would be short topics in any RS course I'd teach.  See: Meshlab, VSFM, &amp; Photoscan.

Carto

For static-map cartography, you'll ideally want Adobe Illustrator, but there are several less expensive commercial choices that may suffice.  My experience with Inkscape is a lot like my experience with QGIS - almost there, but missing crucial features like an effective layer dialog.

Scripting

In the field of data manipulation, you'll definitely want to look at a thorough exploration of Python w/ LabPy.  It's too versatile not to teach as a general tool at this point, there's the added inducement of ArcPy, and RPy adds the capability to use basically every statistical algorithm in the world.  In addition, very big datasets are typically more amenable to a scripting environment than desktop GIS.

CAD

CAD &amp; CAD-like GIS software, often used for surveyors / engineers, has a broad number of options led by Autocad which I'm not qualified to compare, but may not be necessary for a pure GIS program.

Client - Server

Hosting client-server stacks, which becomes important for some classes of GIS user, is the last niche I'm going to mention, but the requirements here are so varied as to make comparison difficult.  Other than ArcSDE, The software here is often free, but the server setup and sysadmin to use it is not.

Then you'd have to pay for the SFP/SFP+ (or Xenpak/X2), which are at least $1,000 each end for medium range transceivers, plus a fraction of a switch line card, say $2,000.  You'd also need an SFP/SFP+ capable switch/router at your end, say $2,000-$5,000 or more.
Then we get into the heavy cost, the actual carrier and support costs, which would be well into five figure per year. There would also be engineering and project management costs too.

Then you'd have to pay for the SFP/SFP+ (or Xenpak/X2), which are at least $1,000 each end for medium range transceivers, plus a fraction of a switch line card, say $2,000.  You'd also need an SFP/SFP+ capable switch/router at your end, say $2,000-$5,000 or more.
Then we get into the heavy cost, the actual carrier and support costs, which would be well into five figure per year. There would also be engineering and project management costs too.

5644,5644,8947,Will this wall wart supply enough power?,"I am building a little pen plotter.

It is powered by a 12V 1.0A wall wart, as well as by a standard USB connection.

There is an Arduino Duemilanove, which will draw 120mA for the Atmega328 as well as 50mA for the control pins.

Attached to the control pins are three Easydrivers, that are supposed to draw 150mA apiece, and they are connected to stepper motors with 6 Ohm windings. these easydrivers are powered from VIN.

Also powered from VIN is a 12V 2.08W fan, which will run continuously.



Will this run without blowing something up?
",Blue Ice,https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/24006,"If the drivers are good, they are constant current drivers so the coil resistance is irrelevant.  The fan draws 2W/12V = 170 mA.  So far that is 150*3 + 170 = 620 mA.  If the Arduino draws another 170 on top of that, then you're looking at 790 mA.  That leaves 210 mA of margin.  So it will probably work, but I would check on exactly how much current the motors draw to make sure you're not going to get any large transients.  The Arduino may end up drawing most of its current from USB, which would give you a bit more margin.  

Edit: I suppose the Arduino will not draw any current from the USB connection.  However, 170 mA is likely worst case and the actual draw will be significantly less.  The I/O figure will probably be far less if you're just sending logic signals as those are not actualy sourcing any significant current.

5356,5356,8505,Responding to players paying exclusively with gold coins,"I noticed that my players would pay everything in gold. A simple piece of bread? 1 copper. ""Here, have a gold and keep the change."" They get into a tavern. A beer! Here, have a gold coin and keep the change. They would give beggars gold coins like they are candies. They make a donation to the church. 10gp. That's a stupid amount of money in fiction. But for them that's nothing. They always spend their money on the most expensive stuff in the tavern and would request the inn keeper to open the most expensive bottle of elven wine he has and the players will pay 3 times the price of that bottle. Why? We're rich we don't care!

Most of the time, NPC will have never seen a gold coin in their life. A inn keeper maybe. A farmer, forget about that. My players don't really think about the social and economical consequences of that and I'd like that to change.

First, I have no idea how I should have my NPCs react except having them jump like they won the lottery. That would just encourage the players to continue. I want them to understand this is weird, unusual and almost out of character. I don't want to punish them, I want them to understand that would be the equivalent of donating 25,000$ to the girl at Starbucks.

Second, how would the setting change? Suddenly there's this town where the PCs are spending money like they don't know what to do with it. And as a matter of fact..they frequently don't. In my settings there are no Magic weapon Wal-Mart. Magic items are special and you can't simply buy them in a random village.

Edit: Assuming I'm playing in D&amp;D 3.5 (which is not the case but it's irrelevant anyway because the system is not important. I play in a D&amp;D 3.5-ish setting). Also assume I follow the recommended money-per-level table. I couldn't find the D&amp;D one but the one for Pathfinder is similar. I usually don't give them the equivalent of the loot in money. I split the loot like this: 75% of the loot in item and the rest in a mix of coins and random objects.
",MrJinPengyou,https://rpg.stackexchange.com/users/4000,"Other answers (including my own comment above) address possible reasons your players are doing this, and possible solutions to mitigate it. But you're not asking for value judgements or how to stop their behavior, so here's my best shot at a neutral analysis of how a D&amp;D type setting could respond to the behavior.

These are some responses I've used, or considered using. They aren't intended to be used all at once, and some are much harsher than others. Players engaging in this kind of action are calling attention to themselves, and the world will respond accordingly, but as Flamma points out punishing players is a bad idea. These are possible reactions, intended to make players more aware of the consequences of their actions, create complications, or give the world a bit more depth. Consider these springboards for your own ideas, and always consider what you're teaching the players about your game and your world before you do something drastic or mean.

First, a little context

Depending on the setting this behavior isn't quite as shocking as you're making it out; a gold coin in most D&amp;D editions is worth 10 silver, not 100. Still, the denomination is unusual and even if a place of business makes hundreds of gold a day they're unlikely to see a lot of gold coins go through the till.

""I can't take that; nobody here can make change for it.""

Sure, the party isn't expecting the local innkeep to make change for a platinum piece... but nobody else can either. It's like trying to pay someone with a barrel of crude oil; sure it's worth a lot, but what is Bob the Fishmonger going to do with it?

Same applies to objets d'art, handfuls of gems, and rare/ancient/foreign coins. Finding someone who can evaluate and buy their stuff could be a fun RP adventure, and there are all kinds of stories you can tell around an auction house.

Lavish them with inconvenient praise

Your players are clearly disgustingly rich philanthropists with no sense of proportion. Swamp them with beggars, inundate them with charity representatives, give them tedious award ceremonies to attend in their own honor. If they can't maintain the level of charity to which the locals become accustomed, turn the crowds against them, for reasons the next point makes clear.

This is largely going to be local color, but if the party wants to engage then it give them some toothy moral dilemmas.

The economy booms and crashes

First everyone runs out to spend their newfound wealth. It spreads around, people get excited, luxury items become popular, new businesses open, people move into the suddenly prosperous town... but it's all supported by itinerant charity.

Soon after the party stops their lavish spending or move away, the town can no longer afford its new luxurious tastes. Businesses close, investments are lost, unemployment rises. With an increased population the town can't return to its old status quo: no longer able to afford imported food and having grown faster than its farms could plant and harvest more crops, the larger population begins to starve.

This could provide a lot of new hook: helping revitalize the town could go a lot of different ways, or maybe the villain sweeps in to save them and gets a townfull of people who really don't like the PCs.

Give 'em lackeys

Sherlock Holmes' Baker Street Irregulars come to mind: when someone tips well, he attracts a lot of willing employees. I'd be surprised if some enterprising young urchin didn't pop up to be an eager errand boy. Bonus points if he's got some connection to a plot.

Induct 'em

A high-profile group with plenty of money offers just the kind of publicity and profit many organizations are looking for. Adventuring clubs, philanthropic societies, shady organizations, all would love to have the party as members. Of course, there's an admission fee. And membership dues. And obligations to be fulfilled. But it's very prestigious and members get discounted services at participating locations!

Seriously though, membership can provide access to exclusive quests and resources, an information network, accountants and lawyers to handle the legal issues (see some of the point below), and so forth.

Mug 'em

Clearly these newcomers are rich and naive. Every mugger, pickpocket, cat burglar, confidence man and used car salesman in town is going to see a golden (sorry) opportunity. The party's going to be beset by thieves, get-rich-quick scammers, and people trying to sell them a London Bridge / Eiffel Tower boxed set.

This can provide a lot of interesting action/RP, and maybe even a new adventure: a renowned cat burglar comes to town to steal from the PCs, and the PCs are hired to catch him?

Refuse the coin, call the cops

What's the modern reaction to paying for a stick of gum with a $100 bill? You check if it's counterfeit. If a group of people make a habit of this, the law is going to start making inquiries.

This can go a lot of ways: uncover corruption, make a friend in law enforcement, flee and get a tracker or bounty hunter on their tail.

Note: this is why you see people biting coins in old films. Your teeth scratch off the paint on a fake and show the dark lead underneath. [There's a common misconception that you bite the coin to test its softness, because gold is softer than most other metals. This is incorrect; pure gold coins would wear down just rattling against each other in your pocket, so the gold is always alloyed with another metal to make it harder. If anything, a lead coin (lead was used in counterfeiting because it's about the same weight as gold) would be softer.]

Bring in the bureaucrats

Once the PCs are found to not be counterfeiters, swindlers, or thieves (not necessarily an easy thing to prove, given where most adventurers get their wealth), send in the tax collector and the customs agent. Moving undeclared wealth over borders? Dodging taxes through border hopping or simply not paying? Oh, you say you have no permanent place of residence? Then we'll have to collect your full dues and fines right now, and don't worry; your place of residence for the next six months is the local jail.

Bureaucrats are the nuclear option unless the party likes this kind of thing. Use with caution.

""Those counterfeit coins aren't mine! I got them off this guy I killed... I mean... um.""

Seriously, what are the chances that all that junk the party finds in orc pockets is legit? Maybe the cops or the taxmen find something suspicious after all. Or maybe just explaining how they got their wealth is enough to get them in trouble.

See ""call the cops"" above, but with the added potential for uncovering a new evil plot for the party to stop based on the junk they've been hauling around.

""So that's where they're hiding.""

Regardless of how the local population responds, chances are that the party becomes very high-profile very quickly. Is anyone looking for the party? Say... maybe a recurring villain, or someone who wants to set them up as patsies, or a person from a PC's shady past, or someone with a quest for them to undertake?

This is a carte blanche excuse to bring in anyone you want. Be creative: bringing back minor but popular NPCs in a larger role is a favorite of mine.

  If you have a single threaded application that runs on a PC with a quadcore processor then does a .net program use all four processors?


No, it can’t, at least not simultaneously. However, it’s theoretically possible that the operating system’s scheduler first executes your thread on one processor and later moves it to another processor. Such a scheduler is necessary to allow simultaneously running more applications / threads than there are physical processors present: execution of a thread is sliced into small pieces, which are fed to the processor(s) one after the other. Each threads gets some time slice allocated during which it can calculate before usage of the CPU switches to another thread.


  Do you have any control of this as a developer?


Not directly. What you can control is the priority of your thread to make it more important to the task scheduler.

On a more general note, you should not use threads in your use-case – at least not directly. Threads are actually pretty low-level primitives. For your specific use-case, there’s a component called BackgroundWorker which abstracts many of the low-level details of thread management for you.


  If you have a multi threaded application (say four threads) on a quadcore processor then does each thread execute on different cores?


Not necessarily; again, the application has next to no control over how exactly its threads are executed; the operating system however tries really hard to schedule threads “smartly”. This means that in practice, if your application has several busy threads, they are spread out as evenly as possible across the available cores. In particular, if there are no more threads than cores then each thread gets its own core.

An interesting functor $F_H:\bf Semigroup^1 \to \bf Monoid$ is given by the functor which leaves the monoid objects unchanged, and modifies the homomorphisms by replacing the image of the identity by the identity of the target monoid. Is this a left or right adjoint functor to $G_H$?

A nice functor $F_O:\bf Semigroup \to \bf Semigroup^1$ is the one which leaves monoids unchanged, and adjoins an identity element to semigroups missing an identity element. The homomorphisms are extended by mapping the newly adoint identity element to the identity element of the target monoid. Is this a left or a right adjoint functor to $G_O$, or both?

A well known functor $F:\bf Semigroup \to \bf Monoid$ is the one which adjoins to each semigroup an identity (independent of whether it already has one), and extends the homomorphisms by mapping the newly adoint identity element to the newly adjoint identity element of the target monoid.

After viewing default-widgets.php in the core, I decided to create a new widget (WP_Widget_Categories_BS, see code below) wherein I basically, copied all the code from the default category widget and simply modified the the UL to add the necessary class.

I would like to style my Category sidebar widget to support this new component, but as you see, this requires classes on each li item.


In reading some similar posts, one option I found is to use jQuery to add the class to each li, but I am concerned about the dreaded FOUC. 

Is there some WordPress function that gets me to my goal?

Please advise,

Update: 

I was able to add classes to the individual li's by creating a Custom Walker which extends Walker_Category (see code below), but this still does not get me to the ul which also needs a class added (eg &lt;ul class=""list-group""&gt;).

I imported the sql file into a pgRouting database and all is well, except the fact I only took into account routes for cars.

After Carsten helped me with configuring osm2po.config, I ran osm2po again that ran as expected.

From the terminal, I run the command:

I was expecting it to be successful like last time, as to my knowledge the conditions are the same. However I get the error:

With pgAdmin I look at the empty table that was created, and compared to the first sql file I imported, the new table was missing a column. That being geom_way. I find this odd as I haven't changed anything. I threw osm2po folder to the trash, and unzipped a new osm2po folder. To test whether it was going to work, I ran osm2po on the original pbf file with the original osm2po.config settings and tried to import that into the same pgRouting database. The error appeared again. For some reason, the last column, geom_way, isn't being added to the table.

1329,1329,2096,Consider Global Reputation Points,"I have come to enjoy the Stack Exchange community as a whole over the past few weeks. Originally, I started out seeking computer help from a couple of subcommunities where I could learn and get help with my computer problems. Itself  is a great idea and there are a few forums that offer similar help resources.

What makes Stack Exchange different is that it expands across so many arenas with a single account making it a very expansive place to give and take. For example, I found myself on the English Learning site where I actually have a lot to contribute. I am actually an English teacher but I have computer problems sometimes.

One thing though, the reputation points don't carry over across subcommunities which I think is a bit detrimental and defeating the purpose in a way.

My arguments are:


If the purpose of reputation points is to build a character reference, then shouldn't it be global? For instance, I can be helpful in one community and have a ton of reputation but a complete 'weirdo' in another. Whereas a universal point system wouldn't allow this. Reputation as a whole builds your identity across multiple communities.
I join a new community and I am limited to what I can post (even if my post can be useful or helpful). Specifically, I ran across this during commenting. I had a perfectly viable comment to help a person but wasn't allowed because I didn't have reputation but I had reputation in another community. I had to post it as an answer and then I got 'moderated' by the community on where I should post and was down voted for leaving a comment in the answer area. Thus, losing reputation.
It doesn't seem to create a way for incentives in some cases. For example, I have computer problems and I can't say I am phenominal at solving or answering computer questions. I could ask a question that may not get answered but if I have enough reputation I could put a bounty on it as incentive to get people to answer it. BUT WAIT!! I can't really earn reputation on a computer community to put a bounty on a question because there is nothing I can really answer or be helpful with.


However, I am great at writing, editing and dealing with international students!!! But, what is the sense of me just racking up points in a community when I will hardly need to ask a question much less put a bounty on it? Sure, points are great. It's nice to have a lot of points but what if I need them elsewhere?

So, when I need computer help desperately I can use my reputation collected from another community to put incentive in trying to get a question answered. Essentially, I'm a good guy and helpful at something but I am not a computer whiz. 

Everyone is good at something and thats what the community at large should be in my opinion.

Just my opinion. I used my situation personally to explain but I am sure other people have experienced a similar situation or have had a similar thought.

You are making points against yourself in your argument for the feature. That reason, right there, is exactly why this is a bad idea. Just because you are skilled and knowledgeable in one field and community doesn't mean you know what you're doing in another.

While the system and features of each site are the same, each community is different. They develop their own quality standards and their own expectations, and it doesn't make sense for reputation to carry over across all sites.

The system already gives you a small reputation boost up to at least 101, so long as you have at least 200 reputation on any other site in the network. That lets you get the two most basic features: upvoting and commenting. Privileges past that become highly dependent on the community in which you're participating, and it's dangerous to let just anyone out of the blue show up in a community and start editing or voting to close things when they've never participated there before.

5405,5405,8584,How do I chose a good camera for texture hunting?,"Texture hunting is the photography of walls, surfaces, artefacts, etc, typically outdoors, with the intention of using the photos in a computer game.  The photo could be of a brick or concrete wall, a chain link face, a door / window, or whatever.  It is also possible to photograph a white wall that has been damaged or stained in some way, process it in various ways, and use this as a mask on top of other textures, in order to get a new damaged variant.

Textures are typically lighting-neutral and extremely sharp.  The computer game will compute its own lighting and shadows.  One must avoid having a shadow across the subject, as this will only have to be removed in post-processing.  Typically, texture hunting is done on cloudy days where there is a uniform soft light from the sky.

1024×1024 is a reasonable size of the final texture, but it's usually photographed at a higher res, photoshopped considerably, and then sized down.  The subject of the photo could be something like 5 metres × 5 metres.  The idea is that every pixel is being used to the fullest effect to convey the character of the surface.  Textures are often photoshopped to become seamless so they can be repeated across a large surface in game.

Textures are usually shot perpendicular to the wall as much as possible, otherwise distortion correction is required.  Sometimes you can take a photo from further away and zoom in to get a better view of a high wall.

It is often quite hard to find a surface in the real world that has an interesting texture and is easy to photograph from the right angle.  In particular, taking photos of the floor is challenging because you need to be several metres above it, looking down.  Leaning out of windows / over bridges, or holding up a tripod are solutions.

One thing that concerns me is that some cameras do image processing on the digital image.  Really, the artist has to be doing all of the image processing offline, in photoshop or similar.  I often see digital camera photos with edge enhancement artefacts in high contrast areas.  Perhaps raw shooting mode is the answer to this?

Shooting digital photos with greater colour depth than ""8 bit per channel"" might also be useful to avoid banding when increasing contrast during post-processing.

Another thing is lens distortion — since we need to photograph flat surfaces.  Either the camera has to be good at it, or it should be possible to turn it off so the processing can be done manually by an artist.

How do I find a camera which meets these requirements?
",Spark,https://photo.stackexchange.com/users/6311,"Your main concerns are going to be:


As you say, the ability shoot in RAW.
Relatively noise-free output (but this requirement is mitigated by the ability to heavily post-process and downsize). 
A good, sharp, distortion-free lens.


For the resolution you suggest, you should be able to get good results from a high-quality point &amp; shoot (like the Canon G12 or similar). However, you'll get even better results from a larger-sensor interchangeable-lens camera — like a DSLR. I don't think you need anything expensive — an entry-level model should do. But you should look into spending some money for a very nice lens. Maybe a 70-200mm zoom or a 100mm macro. Probably an f/4 lens will be fine, rather than a more expensive f/2.8 version — since you'll probably want to stop down for sharpness and to increase depth of field and reduce focus error. If you can use a tripod, awesome, but having image stabilization will give more flexibility.

Pretty much any brand or model of DSLR should be fine for this purpose. They all give high-quality results and have the lenses you might need for this available.

",DoubleDragon,https://rpg.stackexchange.com/users/18019,"The resource you need is Han Shot First: the Scoundrel's Guide. It's a handbook discussing all of the rogue build options. Also, the rules of hidden club are required reading. Mr Cellophane has stealth specific build options.

With that said, a focus on stealth is commendable, though unnecessary.

Before we discuss increasing stealth, make sure the rogue has the cunning stalker feat. That gives him CA when he's alone. When he's not alone, he can be flanking with the warlord, druid, or ranger.

You'll want to see if anyone is interested in the teamwork benefits (particularly the druid) from silent shadows as well as the set of items in Mr. Cellophane.

4590,4590,7274,"Why does the C++ standard algorithm ""count"" return a ptrdiff_t instead of size_t?","Why is the return type of std::count a ptrdiff_t?

Since count can never be negative, isn't size_t technically the right choice? And what if the count exceeds the range of ptrdiff_t since the theoretical possible size of an array can be size_t?  



EDIT: So far there is no suitable answer as to why the function returns ptrdiff_t. Some explanation gathered from the answers below is that the return type is iterator_traits&lt;InputIterator&gt;::difference_type which is generic and can be anything. Up until that point it makes sense. There are cases where the count may exceed size_t. However, it still does not make sense why the return type is typedef ptrdiff_t iterator_traits&lt;InputIterator&gt;::difference_type for the standard iterators instead of typedef size_t iterator_traits&lt;InputIterator&gt;::difference_type.

In that function Size is a template parameter. It can be whatever you like, and it's your responsibility to make sure it's correct. It could be the longest type on your platform.

was added iterator_traits was already in existence, so re-using the existing type had the advantage that it kept the changes to the standard small and localised, compared to adding another typedef in iterator_traits.

Doing it this way, using iterator_traits as opposed to simply using std::size_type means that every possible iterator gets the option to specify exactly what type should be returned by std::count. This includes custom iterators which read from a network, or disk, which can use something much larger than either ptrdiff_t or size_type and friends. (It could be some kind of ""BigInt"" if needed).

644,644,1018,Does this statement make any sense?,"I am asking this question completely out of curiosity. The other day, my roommate, by mistake, used 'Light year' as a unit of time instead of distance. When I corrected him (pedantic, much), he said the following:

""Units are relative. And according to Fourier Transforms, units can be changed so Light year is a unit of time.""

That got me thinking and I read up Fourier Transforms on wikipedia but couldn't find anything about using a unit in one domain as a unit for another measurement. I do agree that units (particularly, base units are relative. eg: the meter), but does his statement make any sense?

EDIT
Thank you everyone for all the answers. It isn't so much to in it in or prove a point as it is to understand the concept better. Anyways this is his response after I showed him this thread. Any comments would be appreciated.

His response:
Nevermind, for the first time I accept I was wrong. BUT using lightyears to measure time is possible. My example didn't make sense bacause I was wrong when I meantioned that I'm still measuring dist. If you have a signal in time domain and ...take the FT, I get a signal which DOES NOT HAVE to be in frequency domain. Clarify this to the guy who posted last. Now the new signal is in a domain defined by me and so is its units. This signal although not equal to the original signal, still represents that if ya take an inverse FT. So, the idea of time will still be there. Now coming back to our case: lightyears here is not the lightyears you are used to read when dealing with distance. It represents time.

4409,4409,7004,Does this statement make any sense?,"I am asking this question completely out of curiosity. The other day, my roommate, by mistake, used 'Light year' as a unit of time instead of distance. When I corrected him (pedantic, much), he said the following:

""Units are relative. And according to Fourier Transforms, units can be changed so Light year is a unit of time.""

That got me thinking and I read up Fourier Transforms on wikipedia but couldn't find anything about using a unit in one domain as a unit for another measurement. I do agree that units (particularly, base units are relative. eg: the meter), but does his statement make any sense?

EDIT
Thank you everyone for all the answers. It isn't so much to in it in or prove a point as it is to understand the concept better. Anyways this is his response after I showed him this thread. Any comments would be appreciated.

His response:
Nevermind, for the first time I accept I was wrong. BUT using lightyears to measure time is possible. My example didn't make sense bacause I was wrong when I meantioned that I'm still measuring dist. If you have a signal in time domain and ...take the FT, I get a signal which DOES NOT HAVE to be in frequency domain. Clarify this to the guy who posted last. Now the new signal is in a domain defined by me and so is its units. This signal although not equal to the original signal, still represents that if ya take an inverse FT. So, the idea of time will still be there. Now coming back to our case: lightyears here is not the lightyears you are used to read when dealing with distance. It represents time.

I'll be specific though, anyway. The fourier transform of a scalar number is simply not defined (no such thing as a fourier transform of a distance, for instance). Typically fourier transforms give you a function of frequency for every function of time or of space. Under certain conditions, where there is a relationship between spatial frequency and temporal frequency (like waves propagating in a nondispersive medium here wavelength*frequency = speed of waves) you can then get a function of time for any function of space using a fourier transform, indirectly.

One of the options I think there are, is to show letters of alphabet as indexes at the right side of a plain table. Since my first table is a grouped one, my navigation hierarchy would be then like this:

  

Would it be inconsistent to navigate from a grouped table to a plain table? If so, could somebody give an existing example? I didn't find anything related to this in iOS Human Interface Guidelines, maybe it is described somewhere else and this navigation pattern breaks the guidelines.

Another option could be having a search bar. Can a search bar be used in both a plain table and a grouped table? The existing example of such bar I found is in Contacts app and it is a plain table. In a plain table, could both an alphabet index and a search bar be shown?

If I now go and upload some more images, and on success I run the function load_previous_uploads(), the iScroll plugin then does not work as the sliding panel has been updated and is starting to bug me as to why I cannot fix it. After it stops working, I can simply refresh the page and it all works again, with the new images.

For a better example of what I have:



If anybody can see what is wrong and/or can see a fix, please let me know - I would be soooo grateful!

4802,4802,7631,Symfony 2 and Twig custom error page,"I give up.

The problem is with the overrided Twig 404 template. It is overrided in a default way by creating an error404.html.twig under the /app/Resources/TwigBundle/views directory.

The template itself does not contain any irregular or complex logic: just a layout with some translated text (|trans) and a menu with several links.

The problem is, that I can't get app.user object (returned as NULL) or current app.request.locale (always returned as default locale) inside this template.

I have even tried to override the twig exception controller and dump a current locale (Request::getLocale()) or get user - the results are the same - default locale and NULL for user.

Then I decided to dig deeper and found a dozens of listeners (locale listeners, exception liteners, ...) and tried to debug/fix/test there, but I didn't proceed any further.

By the way, I have overrided the 500 error page too, and everything is fine there. Well I guess that when 500 error (exception) is thrown, the symfony has already set up user/locale/etc, because it already has got to the target (controller/action) and other listeners been already executed. But 404 error (NotFoundHttpException) is being thrown BEFORE Symfony targets the action...

When Jesus came into Jerusalem on Palm Sunday, the people welcomed Him as a deliverer from the oppression of Rome. They cried, ""Hosanna!"" which means ""Save us!""

Is there a book that summarizes terrestrial field ecology methods similar to Wetzel and Likens and Hauer and Lamberti?

I was trying to compile the kernel on my ubuntu 10.4 (x64) with different config files but after transferring the files to my Pi I was no longer able to boot it. 

These were the steps I followed as per various descriptions:  

apt-get install gcc-arm-linux-gnueabi make ncurses-dev ia32-libs


Then I downloaded the kernel source rpi-3.10.y and the tools

export KERNEL_SRC=/home/marco/kernel/linux-rpi-3.10.19

export MODULES_TEMP=/home/marco/kernel/modules/


&nbsp;
Get .config file from the running raspberry and transfer to the ubuntu machine 

zcat /proc/config.gz &gt; myconfigfromrpi.config 


&nbsp;
In the kernel source folder  

make mrproper
cp ../myconfigfromrpi.config ./.config
make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=${CCPREFIX} oldconfig 
make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=${CCPREFIX} menuconfig


Using editor I changed the line to be ""CONFIG_LOCALVERSION""=""+MW"" and continue

modules_install


In the folder /tools/mkimage  

./imagetool-uncompressed.py ${KERNEL_SRC}/arch/arm/boot/Image


The I transfer the new kernel as kernel_new.img to Respberry into folder /boot/ and update the config.txt accordingly. 

Transfer content of folder /lib/firmware/ to Respberry into folder /lib/firmware/
Transfer folder /lib/firmware/modules/3.10.19+mw to Respberry into folder /lib/modules/

Did I miss something or do I something wrong?

so when you do the command the destination port (ie the port 10.0.0.55 is listening ) is fine but when you do the command the source port is randomly generated by the os and that is the port 10.0.0.55 uses to reply back to the other pc that pc is behind a router so there have to be an specific port

",user2948982,https://stackoverflow.com/users/2948982,"I already solve this, the answer was to create a new struct sockaddr, open a socket for that struct bind it to the port you want and then call connect to the struct that the mount client is using and with you socket.

Note that you will have to do the same when you are going to ask the server (Where the filesystem you are trying to mount is) for the file handles. 
Also in the end of the mount client calls the mount function from the kernel and it puts a random port again for the src port, so this approach is good if you want to modify the kernel as well.

5313,5313,8439,Why does my bike make a noise when I pedal hard?,"When I pedal forcing a little with my right leg, the bike makes a noise that I don't know how to describe. I'll try to do it. It's like:


a short ""ting""
a tiny bell
if a small rock hits the down tube


I don't know what is causing this noise, but I think that it could be any of this things:


pedal
crank arm/pedal connection
crankset


I think the material of all these things is alluminium.

I don't feel anything (like a bad shifted chain) when I hear the noise.

It happens when there is movement and when there is NO movement (I use the brake, so the bike doesn'e move, stand using all weight on right pedal, and it makes the noise)

The pedals could be in any position, It is not in a particular position. Just pressing the right pedal.

Has someone else has this ""problem""? Any ideas of where this comes from?

Update:
Yesterday I took out the chain and stood on the right pedal, and made the noise. Then is not the chain, nor the transmission system.

I put oil in the pedal axis, but had no luck. Also tried to loose the pedal, but the juncture point is too tight, and I couldn't.

Today I will try to use oil in the bottom bracket.

Update: here is a link to info on the bike http://www.diamondback.com/2012-sorrento maybe it helps to know the model of all the components.
",jperelli,https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/users/5398,"Could be any number of things.  The first thing to check (because ignoring it can rapidly cause expensive damage) is that the crank arms are tight.  Even if they don't seem loose it doesn't hurt to put a wrench on the fixing bolts and torque them a bit.  (If one moves more than a small amount, get a torque wrench and do them up right.)  Likewise with the pedals.

You can also get noise from a cartridge BB if the cups are not totally tight. No big emergency here, but you need to tighten them to see if that's the problem.

Spokes can make a ""ting"" sound, especially if the wheel is relatively new.  Unless there are loose spokes, though, there's not much you can do about this and it will usually go away on its own after the wheel breaks in.

It's unlikely to be that the BB needs lube, unless it's been sorely neglected for years (or submerged in Sandy's tidal waters).

If the bike is relatively new (a few months old), you should take it back to the shop where you bought it and ask for a ""tuneup"" where they would tighten the crank arms, adjust the brakes and shifters, and true up the wheels.  On a new bike they should do this for free or for a nominal sum.

Why would you catch (DocumentException e) and then throw a new instance that strips out all useful information? You can simply not catch it in the first place and let it percolate up to someone who can handle it.

Also, use Java 7 try-with-resources rather than finally. So, you code should be:

3033,3033,4833,What should I look for in a recording microphone for personal use?,"I was browsing through mics on Amazon and quickly realized I was out of my depth.  There are a couple closely related questions I am wondering about:


Are there different types of mics for (1) singing into at a concert, (2) singing into in a quiet room, and (3) picking up sound at more of a distance (e.g., singing and playing guitar and having both recorded with the one mic)?  What are they?
I'm most interested in a mic for case (3).  This is obviously not professional, I just want something with passable quality and not too much noise considering I'll be in a random room in a house or apartment.  What kind of things should I look for in a mic to achieve that?  What are the factors that most depend on price?  (If it's feasible I'd like to try to fit it into my $50 contest reward.)
There are a few terms I saw like ""moving coil"", ""condenser"", and ""dynamic"" that I saw used to describe mics.  If you could touch on these and any other relevant terminology that would be awesome.

",Matthew Read,https://music.stackexchange.com/users/28,"Guitar-and-vocal studio and live micing has been studied heavily, yet while there are a lot of recommendations, perhaps the foremost among them is ""experiment"". Now, that advice is generally aimed at the professional recording engineer or home studio enthusiast, with a locker full of microphones to choose from. Someone looking to buy their first mike, like yourself, is going to need a good way forward, so the mikes you buy will be well-suited to the task.

Probably the most common technique for studio recording of a guitar, because it's very simple, is to take one large-diaphragm side-address cardioid condenser microphone, like an AT4040 (about $300, well-known and respected among pros), and position it between 6 inches and a foot away from the guitar, pointed somewhere between the neck/body joint and the octave marker on the fretboard:



This is a single ""close-mic"" approach; it'll get you a bit of everything, from the actual strings' brightness to the deep resonance of the body chamber, to the sounds of you actually playing the thing, moving your hands and fingers around. You can experiment with exactly where the mic is; in the image, it's moved up in the direction of the neck, but still pointed at the neck/body joint. This gets the mic out of the way of the performer and anyone who may be watching his hands.

You can do the same thing with a small-diaphragm condenser as well, but the large-diaphragm will be more sensitive, so you can back it away and reduce the proximity effect and the amount of string noise, while still getting a sound that fills your ear instead of sounding like the microphone's all the way across the room.

Another very common technique is the XY-pair. This approach is designed to mimic the way your ears would hear the guitar if you stood in front of it. Same basic placement, but instead of one large-diaphragm condenser, use two small-diaphragm ""cigar mikes"", like Rode NT5s ($430 for a matched pair; generally well-liked in their price range though there are many others to choose from), arranged at 90* to each other and 45* offset from whatever you're pointing it at:



This arrangement is the most straightforward way to get a stereo recording of just about anything; one mike is your left ear, the other is your right, and there will be a natural amount of crossover between the two, which you can play with using the channels' pan knobs on the mixer to create a ""wide"" (""left"" mic panned hard left, ""right"" mic panned hard right) or ""narrow"" ( both mics close to center) stereo image.

The nice thing about either of these setups is that these mikes are just as good for the human voice as they are for guitar; they need to capture all the same frequencies in about the same overall balance, at about the same dynamic levels. So, once you have the mikes positioned well for the guitar, just start singing, and make minute adjustments as needed to get more or less of your voice. 

You can provide another condenser of just about any type (side-address, handheld, cigar) specifically for vocals. However, caveat soundman; first, the more mikes you have, the more effort you spend and the less success you have isolating their sound sources (the vocal mike will pick up some guitar and the guitar mike will pick up some vocals). Second, more mikes == more $$$. I'm recommending mikes that are expensive but a good value; you want these mikes, and not their cheaper lookalikes, but the money will mean that you get fewer of them, so I'm encouraging you to use fewer mikes for more purposes, instead of buying a cheap-sounding mike to point at everything you might ever want to record separately.

There are other, slightly more esoteric setups for micing. You may hear of the ""mid-side"" setup; it's one cardioid cigar mike pointed at the neck joint, with a second side-address mic with a ""figure-8"" pattern right underneath or behind it, with the travel of the diaphragm positioned parallel to the fretboard. The figure-8 pattern mic's signal is then split into two channels, one out-of-phase with the other, and when you bring it all back together in the mixer, the result is a stereo image that you can ""narrow"" or ""widen"" by adjusting the out-of-phase channel's fader. Other setups find ""sweet spots"" on the surface of the guitar's soundboard and close-mic them with cigar mikes, or seek to capture what the guitarist hears from his/her instrument with an ""over-the-shoulder"" mic (hey, if the guitar didn't sound good to you while you played it in the store, you wouldn't have bought it, right?), all very similar to approaches seen for other instruments.

Exactly what you want to do will determine the mics you will want to use to do it. Personally, I would go with a pair of cigar mikes, because they're extremely versatile; they can go places a larger mike can't, and you can point them at almost anything and get a good sound. Most of the common mic setups use at least one cigar mic. In addition, they're commonly used for all sorts of acoustic instrument recording, from guitars to solo strings and winds, and they also work well for drums. 

The side-address condenser would have many of the same purposes, but with only one mic, you're recording in mono; however, that same single mike would be better than the cigar mikes for solo voice in a studio environment, and many side-address mikes can be set to different response patterns such as cardioid, figure-8 or omni. So, if you want one single do-it-all for home recording, I'd choose a side-address.

Now, for live amplification, these same techniques won't be as useful; they may still work if you're careful, but a sensitive studio condenser mic will start giving you problems when you put it in the same room as the speakers hooked up to the mixer. Such is the nature of live sound; your subject is no longer sitting in an isolated, reverb-dampened booth, but on an open stage, with main and monitor speakers, and the walls of the venue, sending his sound right back at him. In these situations, usually a sound engineer's primary concern is getting the volume he needs out of the mains without feedback, and that means rejecting ""off-axis"" sound sources using narrower mic response patterns like cardioid/supercardioid, or less sensitive microphones like dynamic mikes or small-diaphragm condensers as compared to side-address mikes.

220,220,352,Generating all keypad possibilities,"I ran into this question on Stack Overflow. It looked like a really cool thing to try myself, being that I haven't done any recursion for ages (read at least 2 years).

        ['p','q','r','s'],
        ['t','u','v'],
        ['w','x','y','z']
    ];

    function getPosibilities(keypad_mapping_indexes)
    {
        //if only 1 keypad mapping index: simply return the characters
        if ( keypad_mapping_indexes.length === 1)
        {
            return keypad_mapping[keypad_mapping_indexes.shift()];
        }

        //still multiple keypad mapping index left. lets do some magic
        var currentIndex = keypad_mapping_indexes.shift(), posibilities = [],
            characters = keypad_mapping[currentIndex];

        var charactersToGlueAtEnd = getPosibilities(keypad_mapping_indexes);

        for ( var i in characters )
        {
            for ( var j in charactersToGlueAtEnd )
            {
                posibilities.push(characters[i]+charactersToGlueAtEnd[j]);
            }
        }

        return posibilities;
    }

    return function(pressed_keys)
    {
        return getPosibilities(pressed_keys);
    }

})();


Usage would be:

keypadPossibilities([1,2,3]);


It works, so thats nice (no debugging required, that was a first). So, shoot, code remarks, performance remakrs, ... You can go full package. Everything to learn new cool stuff about JS.
",Pinoniq,https://codereview.stackexchange.com/users/26276,"Overall, I'd say recursion is a good way to go. Good use of an IIFE to keep things tidy as well. I do however have some concerns.

Input checking

Firstly, if I pass an empty array, I get a stack overflow, since you only check for a length of 1 - not for a length &lt; 1. I am technically passing the correct type (an array) to the function, so it should handle it (if I pass something that's not an array, then it's my own fault).

Also, if I pass [9] (or [31415]) I just get undefined back, though an empty array would probably be more fitting.

shift() is destructive

Be careful with shift()! You're modifying the array that's been passed to the function, even though it doesn't really ""belong to you"". The caller might still have a use for it.

For instance,

var numbers = [1, 2, 3];
var words = keypadPossibilities(numbers);
console.log(""You typed "" + numbers.length + "" digits, producing "" + words.length + "" possible words"");


will print

You typed 0 digits, producing 27 possible words

Wait, zero digits? Thing is, numbers is suddenly empty; everything's been shifted out by passing it to keypadPossibilities.

This of course also happens when the function recurses, which could spell trouble. Luckily, in your case, you don't use the input array for anything after having recursed, but if you did you'd find that the recursion had truncated it down to empty.

Don't use for...in for arrays

for...in will iterate properties of an object, and with no guaranteed order. It usually works for arrays, but it's not a sure thing. It's semantically different from iterating the actual, indexed elements in the array. So use either a regular ol' for loop, or - if you're targeting modern runtimes, maybe a forEach().

However, you could also use map() and reduce() in this case (see below).

Other stuff

This function-wrapper around a call to getPosibilities is unnecessary:

return function(pressed_keys)
{
    return getPosibilities(pressed_keys);
}


(Oh, and there's a typo: getPosibilities is missing an extra ""s"". I'll just use the corrected name from hereon out)

You could simply replace the above with just:

return getPossibilities;


and done.

However, with the point about shift() in mind, the easiest thing to do would probably be something like

return function(pressed_keys)
{
    return getPossibilities(pressed_keys.slice());
}


Now, pressed_keys gets sliced (duplicated) before it's passed to getPossibilities.

You could also do the slicing in getPossibilities (and do the direct return, shown above), but - as the code's already proved - you don't really need it there. But in the interest of being thorough, it'd look something like:

var currentIndex = keypad_mapping_indexes[0]
// ... snip ...
var charactersToGlueAtEnd = getPossibilities(digits.slice(1)); // duplicate array from index 1 and up


A few notes on style

In terms of style, I'm not a fan of brace-on-new-line in JavaScript. Yes, it works, but it can bite you, since JS will sometimes do automatic semicolon insertion at newlines and break your code. So the convention is to use brace-on-same-line style.

Also by convention, all names in JS should be camelCase. You're using a bit of both; aim for consistency.



Here's a possible version incorporating the points above

var keypadPossibilities = (function() {
  var keypadMapping = [
    null,
    ['a','b','c'],
    ['d','e','f'],
    ['g','h','i'],
    ['j','k','l'],
    ['m','n','o'],
    ['p','q','r','s'],
    ['t','u','v'],
    ['w','x','y','z']
  ];

  function getPossibilities(digits) {
    var characters = keypadMapping[digits.shift()],
        charactersToGlueAtEnd;

    if(!digits.length) {
      return characters || [];
    }

    charactersToGlueAtEnd = getPossibilities(digits);

    return characters.reduce(function (memo, character) {
      var words = charactersToGlueAtEnd.map(function (string) { return character + string; });
      return memo.concat(words);
    }, []);
  }

  return function (digits) {
    return getPossibilities(digits.slice()); // make sure we work on a copy of the input array
  };
})();

1916,1916,3048,What should I look for in a recording microphone for personal use?,"I was browsing through mics on Amazon and quickly realized I was out of my depth.  There are a couple closely related questions I am wondering about:


Are there different types of mics for (1) singing into at a concert, (2) singing into in a quiet room, and (3) picking up sound at more of a distance (e.g., singing and playing guitar and having both recorded with the one mic)?  What are they?
I'm most interested in a mic for case (3).  This is obviously not professional, I just want something with passable quality and not too much noise considering I'll be in a random room in a house or apartment.  What kind of things should I look for in a mic to achieve that?  What are the factors that most depend on price?  (If it's feasible I'd like to try to fit it into my $50 contest reward.)
There are a few terms I saw like ""moving coil"", ""condenser"", and ""dynamic"" that I saw used to describe mics.  If you could touch on these and any other relevant terminology that would be awesome.

",Matthew Read,https://music.stackexchange.com/users/28,"There are two (popular) types of microphones: dynamic microphones and electret/condensor mics.

Dynamic microphones

They work like a speaker in reverse. Sound moves a diaphragm/coil assembly. The coil moves over a magnet and a current gets induces. Hence we have voltage.

Very good at very loud sources, can be shoved in front of a Marshall stack without clipping
no inherent noise on their own
However, very low sensitivity. Need a LOT of amplification for low and medium level sources
They are almost always ""Cardoid"" or ""supercardiods"". This makes them more resilient against feedback but it also creates a lot of artificial bass amplification for sources that are close to the mic. They tend to make the voice very ""boomy""
Frequency response is typically not very flat.


Electret or Condenser Microphones

They work by having a diaphragm moving against a statically charged electrode. Moving the diaphragm changes the electric capacity of the contraption which modulates the charge current. The current is super tiny so all microphone of these type have build in pre-amplifier that needs a power supply. This supply either comes from a battery, an external power supply box, 48V phantom supply from a mixer or interface box, or from the USB spigot. Electret are mostly omni directional but some are also cardioid or supercardiod or even switchable. We assume an omni here,


They tent to have a very flat frequency response, especially if it's an omni directional microphone.
Frequency response does not change with distance (no boomy voice)
Tend to have good sensitivity, good for low and medium level sources
Can clip at high volumes, so need to managed carefully
Has inherent noise in the capsule and the pre-amp. The larger the diaphragm, the smaller the noise
Fairly sensitive to feedback
Due to omni character more likely to pick up environmental noise


Because of the trade offs listed, most people use dynamic cardioid microphones in live situations and an omni-directional electret/condenser mic for recording. Electret are cleaner and truer to the original sound source but they need to be carefully managed in terms of placement, gain, noise, clipping, and external noise pick up.

Tip: if you are into DIY projects you can build your own with a very inexpensive electret capsule (such as the Panasonic WM-61A). See https://pantherfile.uwm.edu/type/www/audio-reports/PanasonicWM-61A_OtherBinauralRigs/WM61A_Webpage_Caps_Mounts.html.

  man who is to go into the siege by you, that it should be punished by

  capture it, you shall not destroy its trees by wielding an ax against

Rashi explains that the word 'Ki' denotes a (rhetorical) question not a statement:


  Is the tree of the field a man, to go into the siege before you]?: The word כִּי here means“perhaps:” Is the tree of the field perhaps a
  man who is to go into the siege by you, that it should be punished by
  the suffering of hunger and thirst like the people of the city? Why
  should you destroy it?

5165,5165,8207,How can I prevent the intake vent for an on demand water heater from getting plugged?,"We have a Navien on demand water heater. The intake and outlet vent pipes run out through the poured concrete foundation and have a plastic grill on the end.
If the intake vent is blocked in any way the water heater will not turn on as a safety feature.

I have to add another tighter mesh over the intake in the summer or paper wasps build nests inside the pipe.  If I leave the mesh on then in the winter it gets blocked with snow and ice.

I need some sort of vent cover that blocks insects and does not get blocked by snow. Here is a sample with the ""as delivered by the contractor"" on the right and with a crude but workable filter for summer use on the left.



Any ideas?

5857,5857,9277,Flying and sorcery,"Rashi (Sanhedrin 44b, s.v. D'ba'ya) relates the story of Shimon ben Shetach's capture of 80 witches. He instructed his students to pick up the witches because the sorcery would be powerless against the students if the witches were ungrounded. Is this to say that sorcery does not work unless the practitioner is grounded?

If so, how can we interpret the Midrash (Bamidbar Rabba, 20:20) that states that Bilaam used sorcery to fly through the air?
",Fred,https://judaism.stackexchange.com/users/1442,"I think, in the Rashi on Sanhedrin 44b, the subject of the sentence ""He should lift one of them from the ground"" is not referring to one of the witches, but to one of the jars that he distributed in the sentence before.


  As translated here: http://www.bmv.org.il/shiurim/sanhedrin/san080.html
  
  [Shimon ben Shetach] assembled eighty tall young men and distributed to each of them a jar
  with a cloak wrapped up inside (it was a rainy day). He also told them
  to make sure that they were always eighty in number. ""When you come
  inside,"" he said, ""one of you must raise his jar from the ground; from
  that moment the witches will have no further hold over you; if that
  does not work then we can never beat them."" Shim'on ben-Shataĥ went
  into the witches' coven and left the young men outside. When the
  witches asked him who he was he replied that he was a wizard who had
  come to test them with his wizardry. ""What tricks can you do?"" they
  asked. ""Despite the fact that it is raining today I can produce eighty
  young men with dry cloaks!"" ""Show us!"" He went outside and beckoned
  the young men inside. They removed the cloaks from the jars, put them
  on, and came into the coven. Thus they bettered the witches, took them

  does not work then we can never beat them."" Shim'on ben-Shataĥ went
  into the witches' coven and left the young men outside. When the
  witches asked him who he was he replied that he was a wizard who had
  come to test them with his wizardry. ""What tricks can you do?"" they
  asked. ""Despite the fact that it is raining today I can produce eighty
  young men with dry cloaks!"" ""Show us!"" He went outside and beckoned

some general background from the program.
all the bricks are just 2 points (x,y) a top right point and a bottom left point. the ball is just 1 point with a radius. for my current collision detection i'm just checking if the balls coordinates  is at or in between the two box coordinates  

any help is appreciated and thanks in advance 
",user979490,https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/users/10334,"assuming you are at a place where the ball is just contacting the brick;

You will have to create a structure that holds a point located on each edge, and a vector for each edge that is the edge's normal.

Give that structure a method that iterates through each point, creates a vector that is the difference between the ball's center &amp; the point, dot it to the corresponding normal, and only one of the 4 results will be a positive number, that's the edge that has intersected.

pseudo code:

struct brick

Vector min, max, L, R, T, B; //letters repre points on edges
Vector normalLeft, normalRight, normalTop, normalBottom;

//ctor
Brick(min, max)
{
   //generate values for all the fields above

     }

   }

}


in the following diagram, it would return normalB. notice how all the other normals point away from the ball (thus would return values less than 0).
The points can be located anywhere on the edge, they do not need to be in the center.

It is possible to have two normals return positive when close to the corner. In that case, you must determine distance from point to line (as if the brick's edge were an infinitely long line) for both edges. Whichever is a greater distance is the edge that has intersected.

3546,3546,5656,get_option function,"I'm currently trying to make my own theme, but i'm not quite sure how the get_option() function works, because how come this..

echo get_option('show_header', 'sultenhest_theme_display_options');

..both returns 1 (but Dreamweaver doesnt like the second option). While

echo get_option('twitter', 'sultenhest_theme_social_options');


..simply returns 'sultenhest_theme_social_options', which is incorrect.

An option would be to define the array as such

$social_options = get_option( 'sultenhest_theme_social_options' );


and call it like this

echo $social_options['twitter'];


It returns the correct string, but it only works in the header.php (if the array is defined there) file and not in, e.g. footer.php.



UPDATE:
Following partly ialocin and Brad Dalton i came up with this solution, which works like a charm:

function sultenhest($option, $arg){
  $the_array = array();
  foreach( get_option('sultenhest_theme_'.$option) as $key =&gt; $item ){
    $the_array[$key] = $item;

After Carsten helped me with configuring osm2po.config, I ran osm2po again that ran as expected.

With pgAdmin I look at the empty table that was created, and compared to the first sql file I imported, the new table was missing a column. That being geom_way. I find this odd as I haven't changed anything. I threw osm2po folder to the trash, and unzipped a new osm2po folder. To test whether it was going to work, I ran osm2po on the original pbf file with the original osm2po.config settings and tried to import that into the same pgRouting database. The error appeared again. For some reason, the last column, geom_way, isn't being added to the table.

Would anyone know why it's started doing this?

1845,1845,2927,Migration Assistant fails on Ethernet Mavericks-to-Mavericks migration,"I have the following setup and am attempting the use Migration Assistant over Ethernet:


Source machine: Early 2009 24-inch iMac running OS X 10.9 
Destination
machine: Latest MacBook Pro Retina running OS X 10.9
Connection: direct Ethernet cable between machines


When I use Migration assistant following Apple's documentation I pass through the confirmation code step on both machines, and then get as far as the ""Checking Source Machine"" screen on the destination, and am stuck there for about 10 minutes, at which point the destination machine jumps back to the language selection setup page, and the source machine says ""This machine is attempting to reconnect to your other Mac"".

At this point I'm at a dead end: Attempting to proceed through the setup again on the destination gets me nowhere, and the only option on the source machine is ""Cancel Transfer"", which quits Migration Assistant there and ends the whole process.

On the source machine I've turned off LittleSnitch, which I normally have running, turned off Apple's firewall, and enabled file sharing.

What am I missing? Are there other settings somewhere that I need to check? I've also tried using FireWire to connect my machines, but have a different set of issues there.
",orome,https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/4395,"Here are the points which don't block Migration Assistant on the source Mac side:

Firewall on

File Sharing off

FileVault on


Here are 2 key points which blocks the reachability of Migration Assistant on the source Mac side:

IPv6

IPv6 off


This isn't the default configuration. But within enterprise large networks it
is a usefull practice to avoid IPv6 problems when your infrastructure and
your other computers don't manage it yet.

If IPv6 is off on the source Mac, just turn it on before firing the installation process from the target Mac.

Firewall setting

If your firewall setting on the source Mac is set so that it won't automatically accept connection from signed software (as in this screen capture)


then ""Migration Assistant"" will fail (the connection will fail, and the source Mac won't display the code to confirm it is the right source).

You just have to turn this switch on before firing the installation process from the target Mac.
Of course, this setting won't be correctly transfered by the Migration Assistant since it would block it.

Beware if you want to make different tests!

Once the source Mac has been seen on the network (or direct connection) any configuration change on the source side won't be seen on the target side.

To see any configuration change of the source side the installation process of the target side must be restarted at the boot step from 
disk.

The back button isn't sufficient.

The Migration Assistant on the source Mac can detect this failure factor and could warn us that it will fail with a clear warning window
rather than to play with the rotating gearing.

    while(st[j]){ //Loop till end of the string

6028,6028,9564,Ripening bananas artificially: What is the biological reason,"I am a resident of the tropical island of Sri Lanka, and we have a strange traditional method to ripen our bananas quickly.

What we do is this: We dig a pit in earth that is enough to put the whole banana cluster in. Then, after the safely laying the bananas in the pit, we cover up the pit with a sheet such that only a small hole from a side remains: visualize a small 3-4 inch door to the pit.

After that, we light a fire with semi-dry leaves just outside the pit's door. (Semi-dry leaves are used to get as much smoke as possible. Dry leaves do not give that much smoke, because they completely oxidize quickly). And the smoke is sent through the door by blowing it with the aid of a bamboo.



This sends a good amount of smoke and warms the inside of the pit considerably. And by experience I can tell you that this makes the bananas to ripen really quickly. I have done a controlled experiment where half of the cluster was not put into the pit. Bananas in the pit ripen overnight and the control sample took days to ripen.

Can anybody explain what are the bio-mechanisms that are working here?
",Krumia,https://biology.stackexchange.com/users/9948,"Ripening of bananas is induced by ethylene (see reference 1), which acts as a hormone and induces the ripening process.

It's did and not do because it is in the past tense. You aren't currently meeting the colleague on the way to work. Also, because it is the verb to do, the verb to meet stays in present tense because do, along with be and have, is a primary auxiliary verb.

Edit: I'm assuming you aren't talking about your escapades in daily life as if they were a story.

4670,4670,7399,Get latitude/longitude of friend's current_location using Graph FQL,"I'm trying to get the latitude/longitude of all of a user's friends using a single API call. I believe I need to write a multi-query FQL statement, but I can't get the syntax correct.

I believe the two queries need to be something like the following:

'""friends"":""SELECT uid,current_location FROM user WHERE uid IN (SELECT uid2 FROM friend WHERE uid1 = me())""'

'""location"":""SELECT location FROM page WHERE id IN (SELECT current_location_id FROM #friends)""';


My problem is that somehow I need to get the ID of the current_location in the first query so that I can reference it in the second query, but I only know how to get an array that contains the id.

Thanks for any help!

Clarification:

I'm not trying to get check-ins of friends.  Instead I want to graph the ""current_location"" (i.e. where they live) of all of a user's friends on a Geo map.  I can get a user's ""current_location"" with the following FQL query:

""SELECT uid,sex,current_location FROM user WHERE uid IN (SELECT uid2 FROM friend WHERE uid1 = me())""


This query returns the following array:

[current_location] =&gt; Array
            (
                [city] =&gt; New York
                [state] =&gt; New York
                [country] =&gt; United States
                [zip] =&gt; 
                [id] =&gt; 108424279189115
                [name] =&gt; New York, New York
            )


Which does not contain the longitude and latitude of the of the current_location (New York in the above example)

Therefore I now need to take the ID of the current_location (e.g. 108424279189115) and run a second FQL query such as:

""SELECT location,name FROM page WHERE page_id = 108424279189115)""


To get the latitude and longitude of the current_location.  Currently, I have a working code that runs the first FQL query, then extracts page_id in php, and then runs a second FQL query to get the current_location latitude/longitude.  However, for performance reasons I would like to run only one multi-query if this is possible.
",pyro70,https://stackoverflow.com/users/783423,"Edit:

The query should work by adjusting the second query to:

'""location"":""SELECT location FROM page WHERE id IN (SELECT current_location.id FROM #friends)""';


When working with an array type in the FB API you can access the value in any query by doing array.value

Also, if all you need is the page's id, you'll probably get better performance by doing current_location.id in your first query



You're going to want to use a fql.multiquery, there is a similair answer here that can be tailored to your needs: Facebook Graph API get all users and their status

The FQL documentation on multiquery is located here: http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/fql/

Also are you trying to get the lat/long of a checkin object? If so you need to take a look at this resource: http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/fql/checkin/

Edit:

I'm not sure that what you are trying to do is possible. I just looked through the api and tested some queries, the only way you could get the lat/long from a friend seems to be based on a checkin, from there you can get details on the page if necessary... Even looking at your second query, current_location_id is not referenced anywhere in the page table, and selecting location from the page table is going to give you location info on the place that it pertains to. Maybe you could elaborate more on what you're trying to accomplish.

Here is a multiquery statement I wrote in PHP using FQL (it will select the coordinates of all your friends check ins, then from there get details on the place of the checkin pertaining to that friend):

try{
    $multiQuery = ""{
        'query1':'SELECT coords, tagged_uids, page_id FROM checkin WHERE author_uid IN (SELECT uid2 FROM friend WHERE uid1 = me())',
        'query2':'SELECT name, description FROM page WHERE page_id IN (SELECT page_id FROM #query1)'
    }"";

3956,3956,6312,Equitably distributed curve on a sphere,"Let $\gamma=\gamma(L)$ be a
simple (non-self-intersecting) closed curve of length $L$
on the unit-radius sphere $S$.
So if $L=2\pi$, $\gamma$ could be a great circle.

I am seeking the most equitably distributed
$\gamma(L)$, distributed in the sense that
the length of $\gamma$ within any disk is minimized.
This is something like placing repelling electrons on a sphere,
but here the curve self-repels.
So there should be no ""clots"" of $\gamma$ anywhere on $S$.
I am especially interested in large $L$.
A possible $\gamma$ is shown below, surely not optimal for its length:

&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;




Here is an attempt to capture more formally ""equitably distributed.""
I find this an awkward definition, and perhaps there is a more
natural definition.

Around a point $c \in S$, measure the $r$-density
of $\gamma$ as the total length within an $r$-disk:
$$d_\gamma(c,r) = | \gamma \cap D(c,r)|$$
where $D(c,r)$ is the disk of geodesic radius $r$
centered on $c$.
Then define $d_\gamma(r)$ as the maximum of $d_\gamma(c,r)$ over
all $c \in S$.

Finally, we can say that, for two curves $\gamma_1$ and
$\gamma_2$ of the same length $L$, that
$\gamma_1 \le \gamma_2$
if $d_{\gamma_1}(r) \le d_{\gamma_2}(r)$
for all $r \in (0,\pi)$, i.e.,
$\gamma_1$ is less concentrated than $\gamma_2$ for all $r$
up to a hemisphere.

This definition provides a partial order on curves of a given length $L$.
One version of my question is:


  Q. What do the minimal elements of this poset
  look like, especially as $L$ gets large?


These minimal curves are in some sense nowhere densely clotted.

Update. Acknowledging Gerhard Paseman's remark, I thought I would include
this attractive image of a space-filling curve on a sphere:

But notice it is certainly not equidistributed in any sense, crowding near the northpole.
",Joseph O'Rourke,https://mathoverflow.net/users/6094,"to me the best possible solution seems to be the sequence of closed Hilbert curves on the Cubed Sphere;
that curve consists of six ordinary Hilbert Curves, one for each face of a cube, which, when appropriately connected, yield a space-filling Jordan Curve for the cube's surface.

for fd in $(ls /proc/$$/fd); do

done


However this really isn't a good idea since it will close the basic file descriptors the shell needs for input and output. If you do this, none of the programs you run will have their output displayed on the terminal (unless they write to the tty device directly). If fact in my tests closing stdin (exec 0&gt;&amp;-) just causes an interactive shell to exit.

What you may actually be looking to do is rather to close all file descriptors that are not part of the shell's basic operation. These are 0 for stdin, 1 for stdout and 2 for stderr. On top of this some shells also seem to have other file descriptors open by default. In bash, for example, you have 255 (also for terminal I/O) and in dash I have 10, which points to /dev/tty rather than the specific tty/pts device the terminal is using. To close everything apart from 0, 1, 2 and 255 in bash:

for fd in $(ls /proc/$$/fd); do

Note also that eval is required when redirecting the file descriptor contained in a variable, if not bash will expand the variable but consider it part of the command (in this case it would try to exec the command 0 or 1 or whichever file descriptor you are trying to close). 

NOTE: Also using a glob instead of ls (eg /proc/$$/fd/*) seems to open an extra file descriptor for the glob, so ls seems the best solution here.

Update

For further information on the portability of /proc/$$/fd, please see Portability of file descriptor links. If /proc/$$/fd is unavailable, then a drop in replacement for the $(ls /proc/$$/fd), using lsof (if that is available) would be $(lsof -p $$ -Ff | grep f[0-9] | cut -c 2-).

You are arrested, prosecuted locally and serve your sentence where you committed your crime. As others have said, local law fully applies, it happens all the time. Your home country should be informed and can at most complain and try to exert some pressure on a political level but you don't have any extraordinary legal protection only because you are a foreign national.

You are arrested, prosecuted and sentenced but you are allowed to serve your sentence in your home country. As @MastaBaba pointed out, there are international agreements to organise this on a bilateral basis.
You are arrested, prosecuted, sentenced and you serve your sentence but it doesn't end there. You can still be deported and/or banned after the end of your sentence. Many European countries have actually introduced or strengthened legislation to this end in the last decade. So it's not either face trial or be deported, if you are really “lucky” it could be both!
You are arrested and criminal proceedings are initiated but you manage to come back home at some point during the procedure. In Europe, for a simple theft with no prior offence or aggravating circumstances, a jail sentence is unlikely and it is therefore unusual to be detained prior to trial. If you choose to “jump bail” and somehow manage to leave the country, things become a bit complicated. Among the possibilities:


The country where you committed your crime seeks your extradition to force you to appear in court and/or execute your sentence (not always possible because some countries never extradite their own citizens). For another prominent example, see Roman Polanski.
You are sentenced in absentia. Institutions like the Council of Europe have been pushing against this practice but some countries still do it. You might or might not be entitled to a retrial when you are finally caught but one effect is typically to suspend or extend statutes of limitation so that such a sentence means you will have to look over your shoulder and avoid going back to the country of your crime (or possibly all the countries that have an extradition treaty with that country) for the rest of your life.
You could still face prosecution in your home country (see below), although that would seem exceedingly unlikely for a theft.

Nothing happens, you come back home and are prosecuted in your country of origin. Many countries do that for particularly serious crimes but some countries also allow it for pretty much everything, in particular because they never extradite their own citizens. In the latter case, the crime in question must typically exist in the laws of both countries whereas in the former case, it's sometimes even possible to prosecute people for things that were not illegal where and when they happened (e.g. in many European countries, laws against child prostitution typically apply to offences committed abroad, without any reference to local law).
You are prosecuted in another, unrelated third country. It's unusual and typically limited to particularly heinous crimes (and in particular war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide) but it does happen. Among those that might take interest are your country or countries of residence or the country of origin or residence of any of your victims and Baltasar Garzón. See also Wikipedia.


Among other curiosities, the fact that it might sometimes be possible to be prosecuted in several places also raises questions related to the application of the non bis in idem principle.

In short, it depends a lot on the details, there is no overarching principle or international agreement that would apply in all cases.

2470,2470,3937,check if a string has four consecutive letters in ascending or descending order,"Good day stack overflow.

I'm a noob in using regex and here is my problem - I need to check a password if it contains 4 consecutive characters. so far what I have just covered is regarding the digits. Here is my regex:

ascending digits - ^.?(?:0123|1234|2345|3456|4567|5678|6789).$

descending digits - ^.?(?:9876|8765|7654|6543|5432|4321|3210).$

This works only for the digits. I know this is already an overkill in regex so I dont want to do it with the letters. It will be waaay too overkill if I do that.

abcdblah //true because of abcd

helobcde //true because of bcde

dcbablah //true beacause of dcba

heloedcb //true because of edcb

Any help would be highly appreciated. Thanks stackoverflow.
",Oneb,https://stackoverflow.com/users/1012518,"The answer is simple: don't use regexes.

A wine cask has a radius at the top of $30 cm$ and a radius at the middle of $40 cm$.
The height of the cask is $1m$.
What is the volume of the cask in litres, assuming the shape of the side is parabolic?

I have to come to parabolic function of

$$y = \frac{-1}{250}(x-50)^2+40$$

The derivative of $y$ is:
$$\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{2}{5} - \frac{x}{125}$$

  How to implement a white-list-based system in Gmail?  




I only want to accept email from two addresses, the rest I want to delete immediately, unseen.

I know how to make filters and I can white-list those two addresses. 

If I make 3 filter, in this order;

1) from a@a.com move to inbox, never mark as spam
2) from b@b.com move to inbox, never mark as spam
3) from *@*.* delete immediately, never move to trash

can I be guaranteed that that will do what I want?

For instance, can I be sure that the filters are executed in that order? I don't want to lose any mail from those two addresses.



[Update] The accepted answer was almost correct, but instead of doesn't have &lt;list of email addresses&gt; (which did not work) I used from ~{&lt;list of email addresses&gt;}

The tilde ~ negates and the curly braces {} delimit the list. So, mail from anyone who is not in the approved list will be filtered.
",Mawg,https://webapps.stackexchange.com/users/12803,"You could use multiple inboxes and labels, with the following settings:


Create two labels for those 2 very important addresses. (label1 1 &amp; label2)
Create filters to attach those labels to messages from those addresses, and have them skip the inbox.
Enable the multiple inboxes option via Gear button/Settings/labs.
Under settings/multiple inboxes set the top 2 boxes as ""is:label1"" and ""is:label2""
Increase the maximum page size to 50, to show 50 messages/conversations for those labels.
Set ""Extra panels positioning:"" to ""Above the inbox"" via the radio button.
Click save changes.


Only messages associated with those address will end up in the top two inboxes. The rest of the emails will be either in spam or the main inbox. 

You can quickly archive all the unwanted messages by using the quick select shortcut for the main inbox that is on the left side of the taskbar for that inbox. Select all, slap a label on them, and then click archive. They will then only exist under that label, and be hidden from the main inbox. 

Using multiple inboxes and the labels will make sure that any reply that can be associated with a message from the key addresses will appear with the appropriate label attached, and displayed at the top of the specific inbox.

Note that the pulsing at the end of the first video isn't anything real; it's caused by the change in magnitude of the color scale shown in the bottom right corner. 

There are also a couple of decent still frames (head on collisions of equally massed holes) on these two pages: 1,2.

This one has a shot of asymmetrically massed black holes, just after they join (with the original event horizons drawn underneath):

I think most of them would be able to, because many of the daily ferries to Finland or Baltic countries (such as M/S Viking Cinderella pictured below) are very large vessels too, and they have no problems navigating through the archipelago into the more central ports of Stockholm.

3411,3411,5433,Get latitude/longitude of friend's current_location using Graph FQL,"I'm trying to get the latitude/longitude of all of a user's friends using a single API call. I believe I need to write a multi-query FQL statement, but I can't get the syntax correct.

I believe the two queries need to be something like the following:

'""friends"":""SELECT uid,current_location FROM user WHERE uid IN (SELECT uid2 FROM friend WHERE uid1 = me())""'

'""location"":""SELECT location FROM page WHERE id IN (SELECT current_location_id FROM #friends)""';


My problem is that somehow I need to get the ID of the current_location in the first query so that I can reference it in the second query, but I only know how to get an array that contains the id.

Thanks for any help!

Clarification:

I'm not trying to get check-ins of friends.  Instead I want to graph the ""current_location"" (i.e. where they live) of all of a user's friends on a Geo map.  I can get a user's ""current_location"" with the following FQL query:

""SELECT uid,sex,current_location FROM user WHERE uid IN (SELECT uid2 FROM friend WHERE uid1 = me())""


This query returns the following array:

[current_location] =&gt; Array
            (
                [city] =&gt; New York
                [state] =&gt; New York

                [name] =&gt; New York, New York

Which does not contain the longitude and latitude of the of the current_location (New York in the above example)

Therefore I now need to take the ID of the current_location (e.g. 108424279189115) and run a second FQL query such as:

""SELECT location,name FROM page WHERE page_id = 108424279189115)""


To get the latitude and longitude of the current_location.  Currently, I have a working code that runs the first FQL query, then extracts page_id in php, and then runs a second FQL query to get the current_location latitude/longitude.  However, for performance reasons I would like to run only one multi-query if this is possible.

309,309,498,Unique Existence and the Axiom of Choice,"The axiom of choice states that arbitrary products of nonempty sets are nonempty. 
Clearly, we only need the axiom of choice to show the non-emptiness of the product if 
there are infinitely many choice functions. If we use a choice function to construct a mathematical object, the object will often depend on the specific choice function being used. So constructions that require the axiom of choice often do not provide the existence of a unique object with certain properties. In some cases they do, however. The existence of a cardinal number for every set (ordinal that can be mapped bijectively onto the set) is such an example.


  What are natural examples outside of
  set theory where the existence of a
  unique mathematical object with
  certain properties can only be proven
  with the axiom of choice and where the
  uniqueness itself can be proven in ZFC (I
  don't want the uniqueness to depend on
  a specific model of ZFC)? 


The next question is a bit more vague, but I would be interested in some kind of birds-eye view on the issue.


  Are there some general guidelines to understand in which cases the axiom of choice can be  used to construct a provably unique object with certain properties?


This question is motivated by a discussion of uniqueness-properties of certain measure theoretic constructions in mathematical economics that make heavy use of non-standard analysis. 

Edit: Examples so far can be classified in three categories: 

Cardinal Invariants: One uses the axiom of choice to construct a representation by some ordinal. Since ordinals are canonically well ordered, this gives us a unique, definable object with the wanted properties. Example: One takes the dimension (as a cardianl) of a vector space and constructs the vector space as functions on finite subsets of the cardinal (François G. Dorais).

AC Properties: One constructs the object canonically ""by hand"" and then uses the axiom of choice to show that it has a certain property. Trivial example:  $2^\mathbb{R}$ as the family of well-orderable sets of reals.

Employing all choice functions: Here one gets uniqueness by requiring the object to contain in some sense all objects of a certain kind that can be obtained by AC. Examples: The Stone-Čech compactification as the set of all ultrafilters on it (Juris Steprans), or the dual space of a vector space, the space of all linear functionals. (Martin Brandenburg) The AC is used to show that these spaces are rich enough. Formally, these examples might be categorized in the second category, but they seem to have a different flavor.
",Michael Greinecker,https://mathoverflow.net/users/35357,"If you are satisified with your example of the cardinals as unique objects defined using choice then there is an easy answer to your question. Note that there is not a unique ordinal which is in bijective correspondence with each set; there are many, but there is always a least one which we call a cardinal. So the uniqueness comes from the well ordering of the ordinals. Given the axiom of choice you can always well order the domain of objects in which you are interested and then choose the least one. This will of course, be unique, but I doubt this is what you had in mind. But I think it does show that a better example than the cardinals is needed for uniqueness.

One can construct saturated models by transfinite induction and then show that, under certain circumstances, these are unique. One also has $\beta \mathbb{N}\setminus \mathbb{N}$ which needs choice to be non-empty, and it is also unique --- but probably also not what you had in mind.

888,888,1409,Words for meat differ from the words for the corresponding animal,"In English we have:


""beef"" for ""cow"", ""cattle""
""veal"" for ""calf""
""pork"" for ""pig""
""mutton"" for ""sheep""


I'm not aware of this separation for ""fish"", ""goat"" or ""chicken"" (Spanish has ""pollo"" and ""gallina"") and other poultry. Are these words used simply to distinguish the meat from the animal (i.e. to avoid saying ""cow meat"") or is there a psychological separation to avoid the association? I doubt the latter since these words developed when people were likely less squeamish than some are today. 

Why are there not meat words for some animals? 

What are some others I didn't list?

4813,4813,7649,Make *Buffer List* always appear in horizontal split,"I know Emacs tries to be intellectual and opens its helper buffers depending on which dimension of the window is bigger, so it may appear in vertical split window if current width is bigger than height, and in horizontal split otherwise.

But I’d prefer it to open that list always in horizontal split, because there are long paths I can’t see when the buffer is placed in vertical split. How can I do this?

See C-hf split-window-sensibly RET. It tells you what to do:

You can enforce this function to not split WINDOW horizontally,

I think the custom power/exponent methods are a probably waste of time when Math.pow and Math.exp would do just as well in this context.
The X/Y passes can be identical except the direction the bell curve is applied in. I'm assuming the extra passes are to handle the edges, but I think you might come out ahead by just doing 2 passes and perform clipping as you go.
I think I see some bit-hacking tricks to avoid some divides after going through the inner multiplication loops. I'm not convinced that doing this and going through all the averaging stuff is going to be faster than just doing two simple passes using multiples in the inner loop and 3 integer divides when the loop is complete.
Some multiplies can also be eliminated when writing to the temp array by making another array containing the offsets for each row. Like this:

temp = new int[w * h];  
row = new int[h];

// make row offsets  
for(int i = 0; i &lt; h; i++)  
    row[i] = w * i;  

// write a pixel  
temp[x + row[y]] = color;  

// read a pixel  
color = temp[x + row[y]];  

Try to avoid calling methods within the X loops, they probably have a bigger overhead than you want for this.

I think the custom power/exponent methods are a probably waste of time when Math.pow and Math.exp would do just as well in this context.
The X/Y passes can be identical except the direction the bell curve is applied in. I'm assuming the extra passes are to handle the edges, but I think you might come out ahead by just doing 2 passes and perform clipping as you go.
I think I see some bit-hacking tricks to avoid some divides after going through the inner multiplication loops. I'm not convinced that doing this and going through all the averaging stuff is going to be faster than just doing two simple passes using multiples in the inner loop and 3 integer divides when the loop is complete.
Some multiplies can also be eliminated when writing to the temp array by making another array containing the offsets for each row. Like this:

temp = new int[w * h];  
row = new int[h];

// make row offsets  
for(int i = 0; i &lt; h; i++)  
    row[i] = w * i;  

// write a pixel  
temp[x + row[y]] = color;  

// read a pixel  
color = temp[x + row[y]];  

Try to avoid calling methods within the X loops, they probably have a bigger overhead than you want for this.

4715,4715,7479,2D AABBs and resolving multiple collisions,"Okay, so this is a problem I've been trying to figure out for quite some time. Mine is a 2D platformer game with a world made up of (usually) immobile tiles and mobile sprites, both of which use AABBs to represent their hitboxes. This game is NOT grid-based due to some complications with moving layers of tiles.

I can detect collisions and easily figure out the depth of the collision. I use the ""shallowest axis method"" to determine which way to resolve a collision between the sprite and the tile. If the sprite is deeper horizontally than vertically, the direction to resolve is either up or down. If the sprite is deeper vertically than horizontally, the direction to resolve is either left or right.



This is simple enough, and it works pretty well. That is, until you have a sprite colliding with more than one tile. As, by their nature, each collision has to be checked separately, different collisions may have different direction to resolve in. For example, if a sprite is trying to walk across a row of tiles, for one frame they will intersect the next tile such that the horizontal depth is shorter than the vertical depth. As the collision says ""resolve left"", it will be pushed back and will be stuck on the corner.



I've been mulling this problem over, on and off, for quite some time, and several solutions have come to me, but all have flaws. I could mark certain sides as unreachable, but without a grid-based engine, determining ""unreachability"" is remarkably complex, especially with moving layers of tiles always a possibility.

Another possible method would be to predict collisions before they happen and ""work back"" the movement to the point of the collision, I suppose, but I'm not sure how the math on that works.

I feel that I'm missing something incredibly obvious, especially since games from the 80s have already solved this problem.
",Celarix,https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/users/34552,"You're overthinking the problem and conflating a couple of issues. But that's okay because, as you said, this is a very solved problem with lots of great answers out there.

Let's break it down:


Tilemaps. Your first example is of a sprite walking across a bunch of tiles laid out horizontally (or sliding down a wall of tiles laid out vertically, they're isomorphic). One very elegant solution to this is to simply not check the edges of tiles where we know a sprite can't get to, such as edges that are ""underground"" or edges that border another completely solid tile.  

You're right that the sprite would descend due to to gravity, then move laterally, then get stuck... but the answer is to not care about the left or right edges of the tiles that are underground. That way, your collision resolution routine only moves the sprite vertically — and your sprite can go on its merry way.

Check out the Metanet tile tutorials for a step-by-step explanation of this. You say in your question that you're not using a traditional tilemap, but that's okay too: static tiles are in the tilemap and update as above, while moving platforms and such update as #2 below.
Other AABBs. You'll only run into a problem if, in a single frame, your sprite can move a distance larger than the width/height of most AABBs in your game. If it can't, you're golden: resolve the collisions one-by-one and it'll work just fine.

If the AABBs can move very fast in a single frame then you should ""sweep"" the movement when checking for collisions: chunk up the movement into tinier fractions and check for collisions at each step.

1010,1010,1595,Forwarding mail to different mail system in Postfix,"I have an e-mail server powered by Postfix. Aside from traditional e-mail accounts on my server, I want to maintain some accounts whose only role is to forward all incoming mail to differnet address on different mail system.

For example. I own domain example.com and I set account with address username@example.com on my server. And I want this one account to forward all incoming messages to mailbox in different mail system, in domain that does not belong to me username@stranger.net.
I know, that i can add an entry in in my virtual_alias_maps lookup table.

username@example.com   username@stranger.net


But I'm worried that to deliver message, Postfix will use original envelope sender address. It's okay if sender is from domain example.com that belongs to me, but otherwise stranger.net server may classify this message as a spam.  

Is there some way, to alter envelope sender on delivery ?  

Are smtp_generic_maps ment for this ? 

If so, is it okay, that my server sends an e-mail using specific envelope sender, and then something else in message being forwarded ? 

How else to deal with such problem ?

5702,5702,9037,Is it better for a beginner to start with black and white photography?,"I'm quite a beginner in photography with no real experience in visual art. I became interested in it about 10 months ago. 

I inferred from the literature to avoid color photography for 2 to 3 years, or until I have a strong feeling for composition. 

It seems reasonable that first you should know to spot your interest in subject and express it on final print, a task in which colors may confuse a beginner. Besides I'm afraid that with no skill of actual seeing and analyzing I may end up with ugly oversaturated and dull images. Is there a professional opinion on subject, or I'm just inventing limitations of my own?

3979,3979,6352,Grouping by day + events spanning several days,"This is a question that has already been asked on Drupal.org. It's exactly what I need on my view, but it hasn't been answered yet.

Posted by Amanda-333 on April 12, 2011 at 5:58am
I wanted to ask how I can group events by day in a view.

It works fine if I only have events that have their start- and endtime on the same day.
2011-04-12
2011-04-12 10:00 – 2011-04-12 18:00 Event 1
2011-04-12 12:00 – 2011-04-12 14:00 Event 2

2011-04-13
2011-04-13 10:00 – 2011-04-13 18:00 Event 5
2011-04-13 12:00 – 2011-04-13 14:00 Event 8

The problem: I have some events that take several days or weeks.
Example: I create one event with the start date of 2011-04-12 10:00 and the end date of 2011-04-15 19:00 for example.

This event now shows up in the grouped view as
2011-04-12 - 2011-04-18
2011-04-12 10:00 - 2011-04-15 19:00 Event 11

I would like to have that event sorted into the regular day groups (split that event into day parts):
2011-04-12
2011-04-12 10:00 - 2011-04-15 19:00 Event 11

2011-04-13
2011-04-12 10:00 - 2011-04-15 19:00 Event 11

2011-04-14
2011-04-12 10:00 - 2011-04-15 19:00 Event 11

2011-04-15
2011-04-12 10:00 - 2011-04-15 19:05 Event 11

Similar to how it is done in the calendar – day view. But with a simple text list format.
I can not find a way to do this? Perhaps someone can give me a little help?
