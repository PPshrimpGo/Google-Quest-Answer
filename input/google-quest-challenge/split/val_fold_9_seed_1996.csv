2845,2845,4528,Interacting with openCPU,"I've stumbled across an awesome open source project called openCPU.org and I'm tremendously excited about the project.  As a research scientist trying to create a website hosting my work, I would love nothing more than to be able to run R on the cloud to have my scripts run in real time and show up on my webpages.  So a big time thanks to Jeroen for making this project happen.

With that, onto my question.

How the heck do I interact with openCPU?

I can put an example function into ""run some code"" at:

http://public.opencpu.org/userapps/opencpu/opencpu.demo/runcode/

And retrieve a PNG image of my code, which is great!

But how do I do that in my own webpage, or via a URL?

I can get the object of my original code upload from this page, something like: ""x3ce3bf3e33""

If it is a function similar to:

myfun &lt;-function(){

x = seq(1,6.28)
y = cos(x)
p = plot(x,y)
print(p)
# also tried return(p)
}


Shouldn't I be able to call it via:

http://public.opencpu.org/R/tmp/x3ce3bf3e33/png

What about with input variables? e.g.:

myfun &lt;-function(foo){

x = seq(1,foo)
y = cos(x)
p = plot(x,y)
print(p)
}


I feel that perhaps there is something I am missing.  How do I specify ""GET"" or ""POST"" with the url?

EDIT

Ok in response to @Jeroen below, I need to use to use POST and GET with the API.  Now my question is extend to the following issue of getting PHP to interact with it correctly.  

Say I have the code:

&lt;?php

$foo = 'bar';
$options = array(
    'method' =&gt; 'POST',
    'foo' =&gt; $foo,
    );
$url = ""http://public.opencpu.org/R/tmp/x0188b9b9ce/save"";
$result = drupal_http_request($url,$options); // drupal function
?&gt;


How do I then access what is passed back in $result? I am looking to get a graph.  It looks like this:

{
    ""object"" : null,
    ""graphs"" : [
        ""x2acba9501a""
    ],
    ""files"" : {}
} 


The next step will be to GET the image, something along the lines of:

$newurl = ""http://public.opencpu.org/R/tmp/"".$result[""graph""].""/png"";
$image = drupal_http_request($newurl);
echo $image;


But I don't know how to access the individual elements of $result?

96,96,157,Which color scheme to choose for applications that require long work hours?,"I'm working on a ERP / Accounting (lots of tables and data) web app and was wondering what color scheme would be appropriate for this type of application? Users will be sitting in front of their computers for 8+ hours enetering lots of data on daily basis and I would like to  make that experience as comfortable as possible to their eyes.

Most of these application I've seen are using some sort of a white/grey/blue scheme with white being dominant but I'm concerned that this color might strain their eyes to much especially considering different brightness of monitors and working in the dark. 

Any help would be appreciated.
",Mirko Filipovic,https://ux.stackexchange.com/users/44053,"While a good color scheme will help, the key thing to note here is the need for contrast for enhanced readability. To quote this article from eyemagzine 


  Light grey text on a white background and small text size both lead to
  an increased orbicularis oculi activity and decreased blinking. These
  two conditions are related to text quality, and we would expect to
  find similar indicators of eye fatigue with poor font quality or
  condensed letter spacing.


For examples of good color combinations with sufficient contrast I recommend reading this article on UX matters which has this to say on what contrast to choose for minimal eye strain.


  Ensuring the Readability of Text Through Contrast
  
  For backgrounds behind text, use solid, contrasting colors, and avoid
  the use of textures and patterns, which can make letterforms difficult
  to distinguish or even illegible. Choose combinations of text color
  and background color with care. Value contrast between body text and
  its background color should be a minimum of about eighty percent.
  
  Contrast with a white background
  
  Black text on a white background provides maximal value contrast and,
  therefore, optimal readability for body text. The contrast between
  charcoal gray (#333333) text and a white background is about eighty
  percent—thus giving minimally good value contrast. - 
  
  The following dark colors provide good to excellent contrast and
  legibility for text on a white background: 
  
  


The importance of contrast with regards to reducing eye strain is explained further in the article as highlighted below


  Contrast and Legibility “To provide the best legibility, ensure that text contrasts adequately with its background in both hue and
  value.”
  
  To provide the best legibility, ensure that text contrasts adequately
  with its background in both hue and value. When there is insufficient
  contrast between the hue or value of text and its background color,
  the text appears blurred or has a halo effect around it, making it
  difficult to read and resulting in eye strain.


That said the choice of text and size is also critical. To quote the above referenced eye magazine site article


  Designers usually try to use high quality text when readers are
  expected to read for any period of time, but using a comfortable text
  size is not always possible. In print, there is a trade-off between
  type size and the amount of text that can fit on a page. Nine-point
  type may be chosen because it is cost-effective, whereas eleven-point
  would be easier to identify visually and would reduce eye strain.
  Twelve-point text may be needed for good character definition on
  computer screens, because readers frequently sit further from a screen
  than from a printed page, but many Web pages specify small font sizes
  despite the fact that it costs no more to create additional or longer
  pages. Designers need to argue for larger text sizes to reduce the
  effects of eye strain.


From an Accessiblity standpoint I also recommend looking at W3C guidelines on recommended level of contrast


  1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum): The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for the
  following: (Level AA)
  
  
  Large Text: Large-scale text and images of large-scale text have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1;
  Incidental: Text or images of text that are part of an inactive user interface component, that are pure decoration, that are not
  visible to anyone, or that are part of a picture that contains
  significant other visual content, have no contrast requirement.
  Logotypes: Text that is part of a logo or brand name has no minimum contrast requirement.
  


You should also considering offering  a high contrast option which will allow users to work comfortably in low light situations. It would be a good idea to provide multiple options like how kindle handles it as shown below.


With regards the benefits of using the high contrast mode in dark rooms,I recommend looking at this snippet from this article


  However, using light text on a dark background also has its advantages
  for attracting less light in a dark room.


That said, while reversing color ensure this taken care of better readability


  When reversing colour out, eg white text on black, make sure you
  increase the leading, tracking and decrease your font-weight. This
  applies to all widths of Measure. White text on a black background is
  a higher contrast to the opposite, so the letterforms need to be wider
  apart, lighter in weight and have more space between the lines.


Lastly here are some articles on color schemes suitable for coding which might help you make your final decision (I know your application does not deal with users coding on it but the use case is similar here..)

Solarized color schemes help you code longer :To quote the article


  Solarized doesn’t just claim to be easy to read based on the
  designer’s personal preferences, though. Ethan Schoonover, the
  designer responsible for the project, clearly explains the rationale
  behind the decisions he made on the project site. The most prominently
  visible is the use of selective contrast:
  
  “On a sunny summer day I love to read a book outside. Not right in the
  sun; that’s too bright. I’ll hunt for a shady spot under a tree. The
  shaded paper contrasts with the crisp text nicely. If you were to
  actually measure the contrast between the two, you’d find it is much
  lower than black text on a white background (or white on black) on
  your display device of choice. Black text on white from a computer
  display is akin to reading a book in direct sunlight and tires the
  eye. Solarized reduces brightness contrast but, unlike many low
  contrast colorschemes, retains contrasting hues (based on colorwheel
  relations) for syntax highlighting readability.” White-on-black
  themes, popular among developers who want to reduce eye strain, are an
  improvement over black-on-white themes, but the contrast is still far
  too great.

",Doug T.,https://diy.stackexchange.com/users/321,"The full list of reasons (partially based on some other good answers here) seems to be:


design improvements (a ""good thing"" on the road to the world having the best screws)

network effects (a ""bad thing"")


Some people will stick with older, inferior designs that have many users, since those will be easier to find and they will already have the screwdrivers and bits for them.  Also...


economy of scale (a ""bad thing"")


...gives an advantage to more established designs (even if they are terrible), as production of those will be large-scale and efficient, so new designs (better or worse) will tend to be more expensive.


patenting (and other business reasons that have nothing to do with design) (a ""bad thing"")


As Chris Cudmore points out in a comment to a different answer here, this is the reason Phillips screws are more widespread than Robertson (square) screws, despite Robertson ones being generally better (far more difficult to strip the heads.  ...and what was Ford's first choice again?  ...exactly.).


desire to have some things be tamper-proof (mostly a ""bad thing"")


Guarding against vandalism (special washroom stall screws) and preventing theft (special car wheel lug nuts) are decent goals, but the motives are not always as good.  (Is Apple just trying to protect users against themselves with pentalobe screws, or are there other, worse reasons for them, such as pushing more people back Apple for any repairs?)  The tamper-proof requirement is pretty clearly at odds with what most users would want, though, as each variation means another set of screwdrivers or bits someone would need to own to be prepared.   Of course the fact that the designers of these screw heads often make money off each screwdriver or bit sold points to that being one reason the screw is out there in the first place.


different applications (mostly a ""good thing"")


To end on a positive note after all of that, the different applications of screws really do leave room for multiple ""best"" designs.  The points about wet applications and applications with small countersink-type heads (which can only fit much smaller bit sizes of the grippier designs) are great.



(Still...  We would be much better off if we just started using Robertson screws 99% of the time!)

Actually, triangle heads should be best.  They should have the best torque (as long as the sides are vertical), while still being simple to cut (low manufacturing costs).  I just looked up whether they exist, though, and apparently they are being used as yet another tamper-proof design.

Now both np floats (either 64 or 32) are 5 times slower than the built-in float. Still, a significant difference. I'm trying to figure out where it comes from.

EDIT:

Thank you for the answers, they help me understand how to deal with this problem.

But I still would like to know the precise reason (based on the source code perhaps) why the code below runs 10 times slow with float64 than with float.

EDIT:

numpy.float64 is 10 times slower than float in arithmetic calculations. It's so bad that even converting to float and back before the calculations makes the program run 3 times faster. Why? Is there anything I can do to fix it?

I want to emphasize that my timings are not due to any of the following:


the function calls
the conversion between numpy and python float
the creation of objects

The execution time is 13.28 s; it's actually 3 times faster to convert the float64 to float and back than to use it as is. Still, the conversion takes its toll, so overall it's more than 3 times slower compared to the pure-python float.

I am getting really weird timings for the following code:

s = 0

    s += np.float64(1) # replace with np.float32 and built-in float

Why is float64 twice slower than float? And why is float32 5 times slower than float64?

Is there any way to avoid the penalty of using np.float64, and have numpy functions return built-in float instead of float64?

I found that using numpy.float64 is much slower than Python's float, and numpy.float32 is even slower (even though I'm on a 32-bit machine).

numpy.float32 on my 32-bit machine. Therefore, every time I use various numpy functions such as numpy.random.uniform, I convert the result to float32 (so that further operations would be performed at 32-bit precision).

Is there any way to set a single variable somewhere in the program or in the command line, and make all numpy functions return float32 instead of float64?

3269,3269,5209,How do you prepare for out of memory conditions?,"This can be easy for games with well defined scope, but the question is about sandbox games, where the player is allowed to create and build anything.

Possible techniques:


Use memory pools with upper limit.
Delete objects that are no longer needed periodically.
Allocate extra amount of memory at the beginning so it can be freed
later as a recovery mechanism. I would say around 2-4 MBs.


This is more likely to happen in mobile/console platforms where memory is usually limited unlike your 16 GB PC. I am assuming you have full control over memory allocation/deallocation and no garbage collection involved. That's why am tagging this as C++.

Please note that I am not talking about Effective C++ Item 7 ""Be prepared for out-of-memory conditions"", even though it's relevant, I would like to see an answer more related to game development, where you usually have more control over what's happening.

To summarize the question , how do you prepare for out of memory conditions for sandbox games, when you are targeting a platform with limited memory console/mobile ?
",concept3d,https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/users/5440,"Generally, you don't handle out-of-memory.  The only sane option in software as large and complex as a game is to just crash/assert/terminate in your memory allocator as soon as possible (especially in debug builds).  Out-of-memory conditions are tested for and handled in some core system software or server software in some cases but not usually elsewhere.

When you have an upper memory cap you instead just ensure that you never need more than that amount of memory.  You can keep a maximum number of allowed NPCs at a time, for instance, and simply stop spawning new non-essential NPCs once that cap is hit.  For essential NPCs you can either have them replace non-essential ones or have a separate pool/cap for essential NPCs that your designers know to design around (e.g. if you can only have 3 essential NPCsa, the designers will not put more than 3 in an area/chunk - good tools will help designers do this properly and testing is essential of course).

A really good streaming system is also important especially for sandbox games.  You don't need to keep all NPCs and items in memory.  As you move through chunks of the world new chunks will be streamed in and old chunks streamed out.  These will generally include NPCs and items as well as terrain.  Design and engineering caps on item limits need to be set with this system in mind, knowing that at most X old chunks will be kept around and pro-actively loaded Y new chunks will be loaded, so the game needs to have space to keep all the data of X+Y+1 chunks in memory.

Some games do attempt to handle out-of-memory situations with a two-pass approach.  Keeping in mind that most games have a lot of technically unnecessary cached data (say, the old chunks mentioned above) and a memory allocation might do something like:

allocate(bytes):
  if can_allocate(bytes):
    return internal_allocate(bytes)
  else:
    warning(LOW_MEMORY)
    tell_systems_to_dump_caches()

    if can_allocate(bytes):

This is a last-stop measure to deal with unexpected situations in release but during debugging and testing you should probably just immediately crash.  You don't want to have to rely on this kind of stuff (especially because dumping the caches may have some serious performance consequences).

You might also consider dumping high-res copies of some data, for instance you might dump the higher-resolution mipmap levels of textures if you are running low on GPU memory (or any memory in a shared-memory architecture).  This usually requires a lot of architectural work to make worth it, though.

Note that some very unlimited sandbox games can be rather easily just crashed, even on PC (remember that the common 32-bit apps have a limit of 2-3GB of address space even if you have a PC with 128GB of RAM; a 64-bit OS and hardware allows more 32-bit apps to run simultaneously but can't do anything to make a 32-bit binary have a larger address space).  In the end, you either have a very flexible game world that will need unbounded memory space to run in every case or you have a very limited and controlled world that always works perfectly in bounded memory (or something somewhere in between).

Possible techniques:


Use memory pools with upper limit.
Delete objects that are no longer needed periodically.
Allocate extra amount of memory at the beginning so it can be freed
later as a recovery mechanism. I would say around 2-4 MBs.


This is more likely to happen in mobile/console platforms where memory is usually limited unlike your 16 GB PC. I am assuming you have full control over memory allocation/deallocation and no garbage collection involved. That's why am tagging this as C++.

Please note that I am not talking about Effective C++ Item 7 ""Be prepared for out-of-memory conditions"", even though it's relevant, I would like to see an answer more related to game development, where you usually have more control over what's happening.

To summarize the question , how do you prepare for out of memory conditions for sandbox games, when you are targeting a platform with limited memory console/mobile ?
","Generally, you don't handle out-of-memory.  The only sane option in software as large and complex as a game is to just crash/assert/terminate in your memory allocator as soon as possible (especially in debug builds).  Out-of-memory conditions are tested for and handled in some core system software or server software in some cases but not usually elsewhere.

When you have an upper memory cap you instead just ensure that you never need more than that amount of memory.  You can keep a maximum number of allowed NPCs at a time, for instance, and simply stop spawning new non-essential NPCs once that cap is hit.  For essential NPCs you can either have them replace non-essential ones or have a separate pool/cap for essential NPCs that your designers know to design around (e.g. if you can only have 3 essential NPCsa, the designers will not put more than 3 in an area/chunk - good tools will help designers do this properly and testing is essential of course).

A really good streaming system is also important especially for sandbox games.  You don't need to keep all NPCs and items in memory.  As you move through chunks of the world new chunks will be streamed in and old chunks streamed out.  These will generally include NPCs and items as well as terrain.  Design and engineering caps on item limits need to be set with this system in mind, knowing that at most X old chunks will be kept around and pro-actively loaded Y new chunks will be loaded, so the game needs to have space to keep all the data of X+Y+1 chunks in memory.

Some games do attempt to handle out-of-memory situations with a two-pass approach.  Keeping in mind that most games have a lot of technically unnecessary cached data (say, the old chunks mentioned above) and a memory allocation might do something like:

allocate(bytes):
  if can_allocate(bytes):
    return internal_allocate(bytes)
  else:
    warning(LOW_MEMORY)
    tell_systems_to_dump_caches()

    if can_allocate(bytes):
      return internal_allocate(bytes)
    else:
      fatal_error(OUT_OF_MEMORY)


This is a last-stop measure to deal with unexpected situations in release but during debugging and testing you should probably just immediately crash.  You don't want to have to rely on this kind of stuff (especially because dumping the caches may have some serious performance consequences).

You might also consider dumping high-res copies of some data, for instance you might dump the higher-resolution mipmap levels of textures if you are running low on GPU memory (or any memory in a shared-memory architecture).

3326,3326,5309,Why does my 24VDC fan draw much less current than labeled?,"I have three Delta PFB0824UHE, which were provided to me by a customer for a project. They are labeled 0.93A.



When actually hooked up to 24V, the fan draws .45A, regardless of head pressure. This current varies linearly with input voltage, going as low as .2A and as high as .5A across the fan's spec'd input voltage range. I have three units, which all behave the same. 

The datasheets I find for this part indicate a current draw of 0.77A.

I’m confused as to how much current I should actually expect this fan to draw. Do fan manufacturers typically allow that much overhead in their specs? Are they subject to manufacturing variations to that degree? Do I perhaps have some special variant of the fan, and not know it? Are they perhaps mislabeled?

5771,5771,9147,Opamp Voltage Doubler Unstable (After Extended Operation),"I've been working on a circuit which would drive an industry standard pneumatic regulator (E/P transducer).  The transducer takes a standard 0-10V command signal with a typical input impedance of 6.5 kOhms.  The DAC that I've selected (ADI 12bit 8 channel) has an internal 2.5V reference and can output 0-5V.  

After researching extensively, an opamp voltage doubler seemed like a good fit.  This worked and was rock solid for about two weeks, but failed after a ~2 day period of continuous operation without warning.  Now the opamp output is close to a correct 2.0 gain but constantly fluctuates as if the output is barely stable and poorly damped.  Has anyone ever seen an opamp fail this way?  

We're using a UA7812 linear regulator to supply 12V (from 24V) to the opamp quad (LM324AN) and admittedly it may not be sufficiently heatsinked (gets wicked hot to touch). Still, the 12V supply is solid at 11.83V and voltages supplied by the DAC appear correct and stable.  The actual resistors on the board are 10k with 0.1% accuracy and each measure 9.95k precisely.  Any advice in solving the problem is tremendously appreciated!  It's essential that this be a robust circuit.

Below is our final opamp configuration (and the part number):


",Liquid Plasmas,https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/68582,"Your circuit should work, but there are some things that you should check:

First: Why is your regulator getting hot? Your OpAmp has a supply current of 3mA and the current into your pneumatic regulator should be less than 2mA. Even with your regulator dropping 12V at a worst case current of 10mA that only makes 0.12 Watt of dissipated power on the regulator. It should not get hot from this.

Are you driving any other things with it? 

If not, check why you have a higher current than expected. You'll likely find the culprit if you go down this road.

If you're driving other things with the regulator try a dedicated regulator for the OpAmp to see if the other loads influence the supply. You've mentioned a pneumatic regulator. Is this a inductive load, e.g. a motor of some sort? If so the inductance can do some crazy voltage swings when switched due to inductive kickback. This could be enough to kill the OpAmp over time due to high supply voltage spikes. A beefly flyback diode may be needed to suppress these voltage spikes.

Second: How far away from the OpAmp is the pneumatic regulator? If you have it connected with a long cable you may have a to high capacitive load at the output of your OpAmp. This can lead to instabilities of all sorts. 

Also long cables are excellent at picking up static electricity and may kill your OpAmp via ESD spikes into the output. 

You can prevent most of these problems by adding a series resistor with the output. A simple transistor driver that isolates the OpAmp output from the long cable may also help.

tail -f 


on the log file, and can just see these requests continuing. Does anyone know why this might be happening or what you could do to stop it?

3578,3578,5718,Proxy.pac myIpAddress() returns local address and not ethernet adapters,"This is kinda a Part two from here.

When clients VPN into my network they get assigned an Ip address which in turn gives them the 252 option from the DHCP. The auto detect then grabs this file

What I need essentially is a way for the proxy.pac to figure out if a client is on a VPN connection so that it can resolve a DIRECT for them. 

So if I do a simple var myIp = myipAddress() and then just have it match it from a list of these fixed addresses then it would be solved. However the myIpAddress() function seems to be picking up the local Ip to the machine (eg: 192.168.10.1) and not the network adapter. In my case that local address is my MS Loopback which is needed for some of my local VMs. If I disable my Loopback adapter it starts resolving the correct address. This is not an ideal workaround.

So how do I go about resolving the Ip address I want from the correct adapter?


I have been conducting this testing from my local machine for now.
I am aware that it is not a closed VPN solution, it is just what has been decided at the moment.

You might do better to detect the IP address that need proxying, rather than the ones that don't (i.e. local subnets in the company) and assume DIRECT otherwise.

Another alternative would be to pass a different PAC DHCP option to clients on the VPN. That might be easy if your VPN users are coming out of a dedicated subnet, but it might not be if they're coming out of a LAN subnet.

4746,4746,7530,Reliably detect caller domain over cURL request?,"OK so server-side security is not my forte. Basically, I'm building a service which users may use (via an SDK) only on the domain they stipulated when they signed up.

5115,5115,8134,How can I replicate the color limitations of the NES with an HLSL pixel shader?,"So since 256 color mode is depreciated and no longer supported under Direct3D mode, I got the idea to use a pixel shader instead to simulate the NES palette of all possible colors so that fading objects and whatnot don't have smooth fade outs with alpha channels.  (I know objects couldn't really fade out on the NES, but I have all objects that do fade in and out on a solid black background, which would be possible with palette swapping.  Also, the screen fades in and out when you pause which I know also was possible with palette swapping as it was done in a few Mega Man games.)  Problem is, I know next to nothing about HLSL shaders.

",Michael Allen Crain,https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/users/26371,"If you don't really care about texture memory usage (and the idea of blowing an insane amount of texture memory to achieve a retro look has a kind of perverse appeal) you could build a 256x256x256 3d texture mapping all RGB combinations to your selected palette.  Then in your shader it just becomes one line of code at the end:

return tex3d (paletteMap, color.rgb);


It may not even be necessary to go all the way to 256x256x256 - something like 64x64x64 may be sufficient - and you could even change palette mappings on the fly using this method (but at significant cost owing to a large dynamic texture update).

",J. Chang,https://christianity.stackexchange.com/users/933,"The history of the proper locations for offering sacrifices under the Old Testament is like this.  

First before Moses sacrifices could be made anywhere.  Then once the tabernacle was built, Moses received the command of the Lord that sacrifices could only be brought to the  “entrance of the tent of meeting” per Lev 17:


  2 “Speak to Aaron and his sons and to all the people of Israel and say to them, This is the thing that the LORD has commanded. 3 If any one of the house of Israel kills an ox or a lamb or a goat in the camp, or kills it outside the camp, 4 and does not bring it to the entrance of the tent of meeting to offer it as a gift to the LORD in front of the tabernacle of the LORD, bloodguilt shall be imputed to that man. He has shed blood, and that man shall be cut off from among his people. (Lev 17:2-4)


The idea is that making your own sacrifice wherever you wanted after the Lord had provided the proper practice within the tabernacle was as bad a shedding blood of a human and therefore punished as severely. However this law did not seem practical when Israel was about to enter Canaan and be always on the move, therefore this restriction was was temporarily repealed by Moses with an eye to a more permanent re-establishment of it in the temple:

First the plan is to establish the rule in the temple:


  5 But you shall seek the place that the LORD your God will choose out of all your tribes to put his name and make his habitation there. There you shall go, 6 and there you shall bring your burnt offerings and your sacrifices, your tithes and the contribution that you present, your vow offerings, your freewill offerings, and the firstborn of your herd and of your flock. (Deut. 12:5-7, ESV)


Then as this is not yet practical, the concession is granted:


  15 “However, you may slaughter and eat meat within any of your towns, as much as you desire, according to the blessing of the LORD your God that he has given you. The unclean and the clean may eat of it, as of the gazelle and as of the deer. 
  (Deut. 12:15, ESV).


Finally, as this interim period was come to an end and the Temple was about to be ready to replace the tabernacle, the original Lev 17 ordinance was again resumed. As about just this time, for example, we find the reason why people still sacrificed as ‘high places’:


  2 The people were sacrificing at the high places, however, because no house had yet been built for the name of the LORD. (1 Kings 3:2, ESV)


The ‘high places’ although referred to above as simply meaning a place where people sacrificed offering to God, quickly became an offensive term as not only would sacrificing animals there no longer be tolerated as the Temple after the Temple was built, but this was the place where idolatry was also practices to Baal and Ashera idols. Pagans worship their gods there and just like the golden-calf where Israel mixed up the religion of Jehovah with pagan idolatry, so these ‘high places’ became symbols of the same. When Jews worship there is was a corruption and mixture of God and idols. We see a king doing what ‘is wrong’ as leaving those ‘high places’ in tact.


  43 He walked in all the way of Asa his father. He did not turn aside from it, doing what was right in the sight of the LORD. Yet the high places were not taken away, and the people still sacrificed and made offerings on the high places. (1 Kings 22:43, ESV)


When a King did ‘what is right’ he removed the ‘high places’. In fact this became a litmus-test phrase to distinguish good kings from bad ones.


  19 And Josiah removed all the shrines also of the high places that were in the cities of Samaria, which kings of Israel had made, provoking the LORD to anger. He did to them according to all that he had done at Bethel. 20 And he sacrificed all the priests of the high places who were there, on the altars, and burned human bones on them. Then he returned to Jerusalem. (2 Kings Chapter 23:19-20, ESV)

2549,2549,4056,Scaling FFT output by number of points in FFT,"When computing the N-point FFT of some signal, the result is always divided by N. I can understand why this is the case for a summation over the N points, but often the result of the FFT operation is a vector of length N rather than a summation. Why then is the length-N vector that is the output of the FFT scaled by the number of points (N) used to compute the FFT? Thanks.
",john,https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/7814,"The difference is that the digital Fourier transform (and FFT as well) gives a vector of size N (or M in some cases) that contains sums of N samples.

So, basically, each point of the FFT transform is the result of a sum over a certain time interval of the time-based samples. That's why you divide by N.

You can consider it this way: you take an interval of N samples of your signal; then, you basically sum all the samples N times, but each time multiplying them for a different function, that allows to extract the information for a specific frequency (or frequency range, to be more accurate).

At the end, in summary, instead of having N samples, each one associated to a time interval, you have N samples (as before) but each of them related to the whole interval and describing the component of the signal for a specific frequency range.

Just for completeness, there are four cases of Fourier transform:


Continuous Fourier transform, for continuous signals in time, over a finite interval, that gives a continuous frequency response;
Fourier series, taking a continuous and periodic signal and giving the discrete series of harmonics, so with discrete frequencial components;
Time discrete Fourier transform, the reciprocal of (2), in which from a discrete-in-time signal gives a periodic function in the frequency domain;
Digital Fourier Transform, that takes a discrete and periodic signal to give a discrete and periodic spectrum.


So transforming a periodic signal gives a discrete spectrum and vice versa.

834,834,1328,The number of row value expressions in the INSERT statement exceeds the maximum allowed number of 1000 row values,"One of INSERT INTO script is written as following.

INSERT INTO tableName (Column1, Column2,....) VALUES (value1, Value2,...), (value1, Value2,...),....


Following is the error we are facing on parsing above insert statement


  Msg 10738, Level 15, State 1, Line 1007
  The number of row value expressions in the INSERT statement exceeds the maximum allowed number of 1000 row values.


My simple question is that, Can we change 1000 values limit ?
",aasim.abdullah,https://dba.stackexchange.com/users/10181,"No. This hard-coded restriction exists for good reasons related to possible excessive query plan compilation time. You can workaround it by listing the VALUES clauses in a CTE, then INSERTing from the CTE, but I do not recommend it.

Break the INSERT statement up into VALUES clauses of &lt;= 1,000 lines each as a workaround, or use an alternative data loading method such as bcp or BULK INSERT. The fundamental issue may be addressed in a future version of SQL Server. See also Martin Smith's great answer on Stack Overflow.

Not-recommended workaround:

DECLARE @T AS table (c1 int);

INSERT INTO tableName (Column1, Column2,....) VALUES (value1, Value2,...), (value1, Value2,...),....


Following is the error we are facing on parsing above insert statement


  Msg 10738, Level 15, State 1, Line 1007
  The number of row value expressions in the INSERT statement exceeds the maximum allowed number of 1000 row values.


My simple question is that, Can we change 1000 values limit ?
","No. This hard-coded restriction exists for good reasons related to possible excessive query plan compilation time. You can workaround it by listing the VALUES clauses in a CTE, then INSERTing from the CTE, but I do not recommend it.

Break the INSERT statement up into VALUES clauses of &lt;= 1,000 lines each as a workaround, or use an alternative data loading method such as bcp or BULK INSERT. The fundamental issue may be addressed in a future version of SQL Server. See also Martin Smith's great answer on Stack Overflow.

Not-recommended workaround:

DECLARE @T AS table (c1 int);

That also doesn't explain why our winter bills are larger than the comparables.

What I would like to do is check the amount of current drawn by each running appliance and calculate where all my money is going. I just don't know how to go about doing this.

Is each application pool equivalent to a .Net AppDomain?
Or it is a equivalent to a .Net process?
How is Application pool related to IIS w3wp.exe? 

",Amitabh,https://stackoverflow.com/users/248827,"
  1 . Is each application pool equivalent to a .Net AppDomain?


No, an application pool may have several AppDomains. Each AppDomain represents a single running ASP.NET Application.  Many ASP.NET Applications may belong to a single Application Pool.


  2 . Or it is a equivalent to a .Net process?


Not quite.  See below.


  3 . How is Application pool related to IIS w3wp.exe?


An application pool represents a limited number of worker processes that may host a potentially larger number of applications.  This is similar to how a SQL Connection Pool shares a limited number of connections among an arbitrary number of requests.

By default, an Application Pool gets one Worker Process (w3wp.exe), and it's usually best to leave this setting alone unless you know what you're doing.  Still, an Application Pool can be configured to use any number of processes.

The Worker Process is actually the resource that's being pooled here, not the AppDomain.  There will always be the same number of AppDomains as there are ASP.NET Applications (unless one is in the middle of shutting down, or an application creates its own AppDomains), but the number of Worker Processes is independent; an Application Pool gives you a specific number of Worker Processes to handle requests for a specific number of AppDomains.

A setting of 1 (the default) for the number of worker processes in an App Pool means that all Applications/AppDomains in the pool share the same worker process.

91,91,151,The Probability of Catching Criminals,"I have been struggling with the following question and would greatly appreciate any help  :)


  Suppose we have information about the supermarket purchases of 100 million people. Each person goes to the supermarket 100 times in a year and buys 10 of the 1000 items that the supermarket sells. We believe that a pair of criminals will buy exactly the same set of 10 items at some time during the year. If we search for pairs of people who have bought the same set of items, would we expect that any such people found were truly criminals? Assume our hypothesis to be that a pair of criminals will surely buy a set of 10 items in common at some time during the year. 


This is meant to be an illustration of Bonferroni's principle. Suppose there are no criminals and that everyone behaves at random. Would we find any pairs of people who appear to be criminals?

We must initially find the expected number of pairs who buy the same 10 items per year. I'm not sure whether I do this correctly...

Here is how I've been going about solving it:

Number of possible pairs of people: $\binom{10^6}{2} = \frac{10^{12}}{2} = 5 \times 10^{11}$, using the fact that $\binom{n}{2} \approx \frac{n^2}{2}$, when $n$ is large.

Number of possible 10-item selections: $\binom{10^3}{10} \approx 2.6 \times 10^{23}$

Probability of a customer buying 10 particular items at a point in time:
$\frac{1}{2.6 \times 10^{23}}$

Probability of a customer buying 10 particular items at least once over the course of 100 periods in time: $\frac{100}{2.6 \times 10^{23}}$

Probability of a pair buying exactly the same 10 items (both at least once) over the course of 100 periods in time: $(\frac{100}{2.6 \times 10^{23}})^2 = (\frac{1}{2.6 \times 10^{21}})^2 = \frac{1}{6.76 \times 10^{42}}$

The expected number of pairs who buy the same 10 items per year is thus:

$ 5 \times 10^{11} \times \frac{1}{6.76 \times 10^{42}} = \frac{5}{6.75 \times 10^{31}}$

Because the above number is so low if we do find a pair buying the same 10 items then, under our hypothesis, they are likely to be criminals and not a false positive case. 

I am just wondering whether my solution to the above is correct?
",user1200428,https://math.stackexchange.com/users/72187,"First of all, your calculations on the number of pairs of people are wrong. There are 100 000 000 people, that's ${10}^{8}$, which gives us $5 \times {10}^{15}$ pairs of people (using the formula you wrote).

The probability of two people buying the same set of objects is ${1 \over 10^{23}}^2$ - because the same set has to be picked twice.

At the end we would get $100 \times (5 \times 10^{15}) \times ({1 \over 10^{23}})^2 ≈ 5 \times (10^{17}) \times {1 \over 10^{46}} ≈ {5 \over 10^{29}} ≈ {1 \over 2\times10^{28}} ≈ {1 \over 10^{28}}$ (I dropped the 2.6 just to make the equation simpler)

The main question here is:


  ""If we search for pairs of people who have bought the same set of items, would we expect that any such people found were truly criminals?""

4790,4790,7605,Lead Free Soldering and bad looking joints,"For years I've been soldering with normal Sn60Pb40 solder wire. But now I try to switch to lead free solder. In many forums over the internet I found the Amasan BF32-3 solder wire. It's a Sn95Ag4Cu solder wire with 3.5% flux. 

So I tried it and was very disappointed. Nearly every solder joint was looking different. Some of them were (partially) shiny; some (the most) of them were dull. And the worst thing was, that even with additional flux, the solder didn't flow like the leaded. So there is no way, I could solder fine pith SMD stuff with it.

I’m using a JBC soldering iron station with a C245-907 2.2mm chisel tip and tried different temperatures starting with 290°C to 360°C. The best results I get with about 315°C, with 350°C I got the worst results. I used the Amtech NC-559 Flux – the original, not the fake from china. 

Some other guys told me, that maybe the solder wire is not the best. That's why I'm looking for other soldering wires. But there are so many on market. Some with copper, some are Sn96.5Ag3.5 like the Amtech ASN96A3.5-0.50.

I have worked with many lead free solder wires at work and although they are all different, the end result is always a dull looking solder joint. Having that said - a shiny solder joint is on itself not an indication of a good bond. The shape of the solder in respect with the hole size and other geometrical parameters is (look up NASA soldering standards). The appearance of your solder joints also got to do with the cooling of the joint, how fast it cools etc. This will cause different looks and textures, not indicating anything about the electrical properties of the bond.

3473,3473,5538,What are the relativistic effects of expanding spacetime?,"This is a question I've been mulling over for a while and I'm hoping someone here can point me in the right direction. Sorry if it's a bit of a novice question. For the record, I don't fully know GR, but don't let that stop you from using it in the answer.

Since the universe is expanding - that is, the spacetime metric is expanding by way of a near-exponentially increasing scale factor - we can say that the distance between any two non-bound objects is increasing over time. Herein lays my dilemma; if there were two objects separated by a large distance that had no relative velocities initially, after a long time, the effects of expansion would cause them to have large apparent velocities away from each other. Given that there hasn't been any acceleration to cause these velocities, are there still relativistic effects in play? That is, is there time dilation between the two frames?

Furthermore, given long enough time, the rate of increasing distance between the two objects could place them outside of their visible horizon (ie they are travelling away from each other at superluminal velocities). Since there was still no acceleration to achieve this feat, what can one say about the relativistic effects in this case?

At first I thought this was an easy question. I thought of course there would be relativistic effects and when the objects go superluminal, the visible horizon is there to ensure there can never be causal contact and thus preserve physics. But then I thought what if spacetime stopped expanding abruptly (seems crazy but as far as I know, nothing makes this completely impossible)? Since there was no initial relative velocities, wouldn't the two objects return to being in the same inertial frame? And seeing as none of them experienced any sort of acceleration, how then could we describe their two final states? By which I mean, if we were to assume there were relativistic effects during transit, how would we overcome such simple paradoxes like the twin paradox, or other relevant ones?

At this point, I'm stumped. I even attended a lecture by Miguel Alcubierre since he would have had to consider these types of effects in his design... No help. Equations are great to illustrate a point, but I'm really going to need a conceptual answer as well to fully understand this.
",Jack Dozer,https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/23898,"
  Given that there hasn't been any acceleration to cause these velocities, [...]


As a side issue, even in Newtonian mechanics, accelerations don't cause velocities. Accelerations are just a measure of how rapidly velocities are changing.

What you're running into here is the fact that general relativity doesn't have any notion of how to measure the motion of object A relative to a distant object B. It is neither true nor false that A and B gain relative velocity due to cosmological expansion. It is neither true nor false that A and B have nonzero accelerations relative to one another. Frames of reference in GR are local, not global. It's valid to say that distant galaxies are moving away from us at some velocity. It's also valid to say that everything is standing still, but the space between us and the distant galaxy is expanding.


  [...] are there still relativistic effects in play? That is, is there time dilation between the two frames?


Kinematic time dilation is well defined in SR, which means that in GR it's only defined locally. Gravitational time dilation is only well defined in GR in the case of a static spacetime, but cosmological spacetimes aren't static. So it is neither true nor false that there is time dilation between us and a distant galaxy. Concretely, you could measure Doppler shifts. If you feel like interpreting these shifts in purely kinematic terms, you can assign a velocity to the distant galaxy relative to us. But this is not mandatory and actually doesn't really work very well, in the sense that the velocity you get is usually several times smaller than the rate at which the proper distance between the galaxies is increasing. (Proper distance is defined as the distance you would measure with a chain of rulers, each at rest relative to the CMB, at a moment in time defined according to a notion of simultaneity defined by cosmological conditions such as the temperature of the CMB.) In particular, there are galaxies that we can observe that are now and always have been receding from us at $v&gt;c$, if you define $v$ as the rate of change of proper distance. The fact that we can observe them tells us that their Doppler shifts are finite and correspond to $v&lt;c$.

Herein lays my dilemma; if there were two objects separated by a large distance that had no relative velocities initially, after a long time, the effects of expansion would cause them to have large apparent velocities away from each other. Given that there hasn't been any acceleration to cause these velocities, are there still relativistic effects in play? That is, is there time dilation between the two frames?

Furthermore, given long enough time, the rate of increasing distance between the two objects could place them outside of their visible horizon (ie they are travelling away from each other at superluminal velocities). Since there was still no acceleration to achieve this feat, what can one say about the relativistic effects in this case?

At first I thought this was an easy question. I thought of course there would be relativistic effects and when the objects go superluminal, the visible horizon is there to ensure there can never be causal contact and thus preserve physics. But then I thought what if spacetime stopped expanding abruptly (seems crazy but as far as I know, nothing makes this completely impossible)? Since there was no initial relative velocities, wouldn't the two objects return to being in the same inertial frame? And seeing as none of them experienced any sort of acceleration, how then could we describe their two final states? By which I mean, if we were to assume there were relativistic effects during transit, how would we overcome such simple paradoxes like the twin paradox, or other relevant ones?

At this point, I'm stumped. I even attended a lecture by Miguel Alcubierre since he would have had to consider these types of effects in his design... No help. Equations are great to illustrate a point, but I'm really going to need a conceptual answer as well to fully understand this.

  Given that there hasn't been any acceleration to cause these velocities, [...]


As a side issue, even in Newtonian mechanics, accelerations don't cause velocities. Accelerations are just a measure of how rapidly velocities are changing.

What you're running into here is the fact that general relativity doesn't have any notion of how to measure the motion of object A relative to a distant object B. It is neither true nor false that A and B gain relative velocity due to cosmological expansion. It is neither true nor false that A and B have nonzero accelerations relative to one another. Frames of reference in GR are local, not global. It's valid to say that distant galaxies are moving away from us at some velocity. It's also valid to say that everything is standing still, but the space between us and the distant galaxy is expanding.


  [...] are there still relativistic effects in play? That is, is there time dilation between the two frames?


Kinematic time dilation is well defined in SR, which means that in GR it's only defined locally. Gravitational time dilation is only well defined in GR in the case of a static spacetime, but cosmological spacetimes aren't static. So it is neither true nor false that there is time dilation between us and a distant galaxy. Concretely, you could measure Doppler shifts. If you feel like interpreting these shifts in purely kinematic terms, you can assign a velocity to the distant galaxy relative to us. But this is not mandatory and actually doesn't really work very well, in the sense that the velocity you get is usually several times smaller than the rate at which the proper distance between the galaxies is increasing. (Proper distance is defined as the distance you would measure with a chain of rulers, each at rest relative to the CMB, at a moment in time defined according to a notion of simultaneity defined by cosmological conditions such as the temperature of the CMB.) In particular, there are galaxies that we can observe that are now and always have been receding from us at $v&gt;c$, if you define $v$ as the rate of change of proper distance. The fact that we can observe them tells us that their Doppler shifts are finite and correspond to $v&lt;c$.

The difference form is enough.,"Due to the constraint $\nabla \cdot B =0$, there exists a vector potential $A$ such that $B = \nabla \times A$ and $E_j = \partial_0 A_j - \partial_j A_0$ (up to a sign I forget). In other words, $E$ and $B$ assemble into a ""field strength tensor"" $F_{\mu \nu} = \partial_\mu A_\nu - \partial_\nu A_\mu = dA_{\mu \nu}$. This is the correct object to reason about when thinking relativistically. It's just a 2-form, so its transformation rules are simple. We can write Maxwell's equations as

2445,2445,3903,Why do some transformers hum less or not at all when lightly loaded?,"It can be observed that large power transformers hum more under load. For example, when some devices are powered up, there is brief ""twang"" sound: a loud hum that quickly decays as the filter capacitors charge. Increased continuous hum from a transformer can indicate that the filter capacitors are leaking.

This question isn't about why transformers hum, but why do they hum less, or hardly at all, when not loaded. How is the electro-mechanics playing itself out to reduce the hum? After all, the fluctuating magnetic fields are there whether or not there is a load on the secondary winding.

  chest and shaped similar to a squashed egg. The hide is a dark caramel
  bristly fur and looks like it is two sizes too big – the whole body
  looks like it is covered in wrinkles and creases. Black fronds grow
  out of these creases like seaweed but look leathery and dead in the
  icy conditions of the Ice Citadel world. These fronds later recover
  into their multicoloured feather state after leaving the ice planet.
  Its mouth is a small lip-sphincter that forms a snout on the conical
  end of the body with extremely sharp teeth arranged in a circular
  array. The organs it uses to both see and communicate with are located
  a yard or so back from the mouth. It is a curved pyramid made up from
  three oval sections of translucent black flesh, with the one in front
  twice as long as the other two so it could follow the body profile. It
  communicates by creating images in the ultra-violet spectrum on the
  forward eye. Two fat ridges of rubbery flesh ran along its underbelly
  and rippled like snakes to push the body along. A second pair of more
  bulbous ridges extended from its back, shorter than those on the
  underbelly and extending only a little further than the eye. These can

3615,3615,5771,Should a call to action float in a long page?,"I was reading this excellent site http://www.goodui.org/ when one of the points made me think 


  Repeating your call to action is a strategy that is more applicable to
  longer pages, or repeating across numerous pages. Surely you don't
  want to have your offer displayed 10 times all on the same screen and
  frustrate people. However, long pages are becoming the norm and the
  idea of squeezing everything ""above the fold"" is fading. It doesn't
  hurt to have one soft actionable item at the top, and another
  prominent one at the bottom. When people reach the bottom, they pause
  and think what to do next - a potential solid place to make an offer
  or close a deal.
  
  


While I think this is a good solution in which you have a reasonably sized page where you can reach the top or bottom in three-four scrolls, what if you have a really long page. Do we really know if users will scroll all the way to the bottom and then make a decision ? In that case wont it be better to have a floating call to action button which allows them to do an action at any point of time ? 

Please do note I am not suggesting this button should hide any text or  content but it would float at the side where it is visible but not in the way.

4934,4934,7858,Pictures don't show in IE6 after Windows XP updates,"It was time to update the computer I'm using, and I ran all of the updates except for the upgrade from IE6 to IE8.  I'm using a work computer, so I'm simply not allowed to upgrade from IE6 to anything useful (some of their stuff apparently still requires IE6).  I use Chrome on the side, but I need IE for certain things.

After updating and restarting, I found that pictures in general stopped showing in IE6, except for occasional ads.  Even the Google logo does not show up.  In Chrome, however, everything works fine.  I already tried going to Tools->Internet Options->Advanced->Multimedia and checking ""Show Pictures"" (which was already checked), and nothing on the ""why your pictures won't show!"" pages online seem to help.

Any ideas?

update:
When I'm on the Google homepage, the bar at the bottom of the IE window says ""Downloading picture http://..."", and I suspect it's not the only page that says that, but there's a red X in the place of the logo, which I thought meant the browser had already given up.

update (some time later):
I was able to upgrade to IE7 and I'm having the same issue.  In both cases, there are certain images that show up, and certain ones that don't.  I'm wondering if images got set to display: none !important somewhere.  Looking into it.

update (even later; haven't had much time to deal with this):
Just discovered that all the missing images are apparently .png files.

Completely reset Internet Explorer, also try reinstalling Internet Explorer.
Turn the system back to a proper state using System Restore.

Not running every update at the same time could help to figure out which update caused this...

I'm using a work computer, so I'm simply not allowed to upgrade from IE6 to anything useful (some of their stuff apparently still requires IE6).  I use Chrome on the side, but I need IE for certain things.

After updating and restarting, I found that pictures in general stopped showing in IE6, except for occasional ads.  Even the Google logo does not show up.  In Chrome, however, everything works fine.  I already tried going to Tools->Internet Options->Advanced->Multimedia and checking ""Show Pictures"" (which was already checked), and nothing on the ""why your pictures won't show!"" pages online seem to help.

Any ideas?

update:
When I'm on the Google homepage, the bar at the bottom of the IE window says ""Downloading picture http://..."", and I suspect it's not the only page that says that, but there's a red X in the place of the logo, which I thought meant the browser had already given up.

update (some time later):
I was able to upgrade to IE7 and I'm having the same issue.  In both cases, there are certain images that show up, and certain ones that don't.  I'm wondering if images got set to display: none !important somewhere.  Looking into it.

update (even later; haven't had much time to deal with this):
Just discovered that all the missing images are apparently .png files.
","There are three options, I doubt if the first one will work:


Completely reset Internet Explorer, also try reinstalling Internet Explorer.
Turn the system back to a proper state using System Restore.

Not running every update at the same time could help to figure out which update caused this...
Upgrade to a newer version of Internet Explorer, perhaps the work things might still work.

I seem to be having problems in understanding the static keyword. From what I understand this far if a class is declared static all methods and variable have to be static. The main method always is a static method so in the class that the main method exists all variables and methods are declared static if you have to call them in the main method.

}


I can honestly say that I have never used a class marked as static with the exception of creating extention methods (Quick tutorial on extension methods).

Anyways, there are specific design patterns for utilizing static methods, such as factory pattern and singleton pattern, but the important thing to remember is that static methods and constructors do not deal with any specific instance of a class (unless you pass one in).  So utilizing static methods is more of a stateless implementation of a methods, e.g. to do calculations or to do a comparison between objects. The ""Main"" method you are refering to is always static, but to see it from a different point of view, see this article.

To follow up with this, here is how the difference between static and instantiated methods, fields and properties are called.

public static void Main(string[] args)
{
    //This is a static method that starts a thread in an application
    // space.  At this point not everything actually has to be static...

    //Here is an instantiation with a parameterless contruction
    SomeObject obj = new SomeObject();

    //Here is an instantiation using a static contructor (factory)
    SomeObject obj2 = SomeObject.CreateSomeObject(3);

    //Getting field value from static field
    // Notice that this references the class name, not an instance
    int fooValue1 = SomeObject.Foo;

    //Getting property value from instance
    //  Note that this references an object instance
    int fooValue2 = obj2.Foo2;

    //Instance method must be called through an object
    obj2.AddSomething(4);  //if default constructor, would return 8

    //Static methods must be called through class name
    SomeObject.Add(4); //Returns 7
}

",student1,https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/22868,"It all depends on what you want to do.  Both methods are perfectly valid for different situations.

The switched-short method doesn't ""stop"" the motor.  It merely turns the motor into a generator and applies a very large (short circuit) load.  This makes the motor harder to turn, slowing down the motion until it finally stops.

The rapid forward-backward clamps the motor in a position causing a very rapid stop. It also uses an awful lot of power to do it, and generates massive amounts of noise.

So it all depends on the effect you are after.  A gentle deceleration to a stand-still, which is most often desirable for things like slowing an electric vehicle, or an abrupt stop, which is good for robotics where you need to get to a specific position and stop right there.  It's a trade-off between precision and efficiency.

Consider what is said in Romans 3:27-28:


  27 Where, then, is boasting? It is excluded. Because of what law? The law that requires works? No, because of the law that requires faith. 28 For we maintain that a person is justified by faith apart from the works of the law.

5382,5382,8548,numpy float: 10x slower than builtin in arithmetic operations?,"EDIT:

I rerun the code under the Windows 7 x64 (Intel Core i7 930 @ 3.8GHz).

Again, the code is:

#s = np.float64(1)
#s = np.float32(1)

The timings are:


float64: 16.1s
float32: 16.1s

Now both np floats (either 64 or 32) are 5 times slower than the built-in float. Still, a significant difference. I'm trying to figure out where it comes from.

EDIT:

Thank you for the answers, they help me understand how to deal with this problem.

But I still would like to know the precise reason (based on the source code perhaps) why the code below runs 10 times slow with float64 than with float.

EDIT:

numpy.float64 is 10 times slower than float in arithmetic calculations. It's so bad that even converting to float and back before the calculations makes the program run 3 times faster. Why? Is there anything I can do to fix it?

I want to emphasize that my timings are not due to any of the following:


the function calls
the conversion between numpy and python float
the creation of objects


I updated my code to make it clearer where the problem lies. With the new code, it would seem I see a ten-fold performance hit from using numpy data types:

from datetime import datetime

    s = np.float64(s)

print(s)
print('Runtime:', datetime.now() - START_TIME)


The execution time is 13.28 s; it's actually 3 times faster to convert the float64 to float and back than to use it as is. Still, the conversion takes its toll, so overall it's more than 3 times slower compared to the pure-python float.

ORIGINAL QUESTION:

I am getting really weird timings for the following code:

import numpy as np
s = 0
for i in range(10000000):
    s += np.float64(1) # replace with np.float32 and built-in float



built-in float: 4.9 s
float64: 10.5 s
float32: 45.0 s


Why is float64 twice slower than float? And why is float32 5 times slower than float64?

Is there any way to avoid the penalty of using np.float64, and have numpy functions return built-in float instead of float64?

I found that using numpy.float64 is much slower than Python's float, and numpy.float32 is even slower (even though I'm on a 32-bit machine).

numpy.float32 on my 32-bit machine. Therefore, every time I use various numpy functions such as numpy.random.uniform, I convert the result to float32 (so that further operations would be performed at 32-bit precision).

Is there any way to set a single variable somewhere in the program or in the command line, and make all numpy functions return float32 instead of float64?
",max,https://stackoverflow.com/users/336527,"CPython floats are allocated in chunks

The key problem with comparing numpy scalar allocations to the float type is that CPython always allocates the memory for float and int objects in blocks of size N.

Internally, CPython maintains a linked list of blocks each large enough to hold N float objects.  When you call float(1) CPython checks if there is space available in the current block; if not it allocates a new block.  Once it has space in the current block it simply initializes that space and returns a pointer to it. 

On my machine each block can hold 41 float objects, so there is some overhead for the first float(1) call but the next 40 run much faster as the memory is allocated and ready.

Slow numpy.float32 vs. numpy.float64

It appears that numpy has 2 paths it can take when creating a scalar type: fast and slow. This depends on whether the scalar type has a Python base class to which it can defer for argument conversion.

For some reason numpy.float32 is hard-coded to take the slower path (defined by the _WORK0 macro), while numpy.float64 gets a chance to take the faster path (defined by the _WORK1 macro). Note that scalartypes.c.src is a template which generates scalartypes.c at build time.

You can visualize this in Cachegrind. I've included screen captures showing how many more calls are made to construct a float32 vs. float64:

float64 takes the fast path



float32 takes the slow path



Updated - Which type takes the slow/fast path may depend on whether the OS is 32-bit vs 64-bit. On my test system, Ubuntu Lucid 64-bit, the float64 type is 10 times faster than float32.

719,719,1139,How to remove color cast from HSV information,"I have hue, saturation and value of a color (HSV color-space). The color has to be set on a device that displays them incorrectly. If I specify white it displays light magenta. However, if you specify some green it displays the best white it can (let's say: gray). How do I remove this color cast? Actually: How do I create a color cast in the HSV numbers to compensate for the wrong display?

My approach was the following. But it lead to a skip of some magenta colors, when I ran through the whole rainbow with a saturation of, say, 0.8 (interval 0 to 1):


Shift magenta to the beginning of the hue scale (60 degrees forward) and thus the hue of the current color
Calculate the distance to move in the direction of green. With a saturation of 1 that means to move completely to green (180 degrees).
This is the formula: distance = (180 / 360 - shifted_hue) * (1 - saturation)
Then add the distance to the shifted hue (possibly resulting in a subtraction).
Shift the hue scale back by 60 degrees.


As said, this is leading to an ugly skip of some magenta colors, because the lower the saturation the bigger the gap at magenta.

Do you know of a better algorithm?
",human-man,https://dsp.stackexchange.com/users/1510,"It is not necessary that your device's color mismatch can be corrected with a simple shifting of the Hue component (except of course if you are absolutely sure that this is the case with your equipment).

In general, to correct the response of the device you somehow need to recover the mapping that it already performs between reference and observed colors and then see how it can be corrected by some curve (monotonic or not). 

For this purpose you will need a colour chart (and ideally, an instrument such as this one).

(Please note that it is best that this correction is applied at the system level, i.e. your application will still be sending some ""color demand"" normally, without correcting it but that demand would undergo some correction prior to display automatically by the system.)

At the very basic level, you can send a simple reference image to your display and then try to adjust its R,G,B settings (if there are any) so that the colours seem to display properly (according to your eyes that is)

If you have a system that is not capable of applying such profiles but you still must apply some color-correction you could try matching the relative distances of the colours with a known target (or image in your case) and then (if required) try to correct towards absolute colours by shifting (with trial and error). 

Take an evenly lit image of the colour chart with a good digital camera, color correct it (to reduce any effects of the lighting or sensor used to acquire your ""reference"" image) and feed it to your display. Take an image of the display (ideally in the same lighting conditions), apply the same color correction with the profile from the first step (and for the same reasons) and then examine the relative color correspondence between any two colors from the color chart image and two colors from the color chart display image to recover the mapping.

1795,1795,2851,Delete un-seen mesh with Blender,"I am wondering if there is a way to delete un-seen mesh with Blender. Here's an example. I have a cube, and it has 3 cubes inside of that cube.



Is there a way to delete the mesh inside of the cube without selecting the cubes manually? This would clear up lots of extra mesh and speed up my render engine. I am using Cycles, so if Cycles has an option to not render hidden meshes, that would be good too. (although deleting them would be better). A Python script would also do. :)

Thanks!
",rioforce,https://blender.stackexchange.com/users/1828,"The fastest way I can think of which works for the cube case is:


Select part of the outer cube (a single vert will do)
Press CtrlL to select connected vertices
Press CtrlI to invert the selection
Delete.




To delete geometry not visible from the camera:


Enter camera view (Numpad 0)
Ensure you are in solid shading and that Limit selection to visible is enabled
Use border select (B) to select all visible vertices (you may also want to do this with face select enabled to select visible faces too)
Grow the selection (Numpad +)

Here's an example. I have a cube, and it has 3 cubes inside of that cube.



Is there a way to delete the mesh inside of the cube without selecting the cubes manually? This would clear up lots of extra mesh and speed up my render engine. I am using Cycles, so if Cycles has an option to not render hidden meshes, that would be good too. (although deleting them would be better). A Python script would also do. :)

Thanks!
","The fastest way I can think of which works for the cube case is:


Select part of the outer cube (a single vert will do)
Press CtrlL to select connected vertices
Press CtrlI to invert the selection
Delete.




To delete geometry not visible from the camera:


Enter camera view (Numpad 0)
Ensure you are in solid shading and that Limit selection to visible is enabled
Use border select (B) to select all visible vertices (you may also want to do this with face select enabled to select visible faces too)
Grow the selection (Numpad +)
Delete.

78,78,127,Opamp Voltage Doubler Unstable (After Extended Operation),"I've been working on a circuit which would drive an industry standard pneumatic regulator (E/P transducer).  The transducer takes a standard 0-10V command signal with a typical input impedance of 6.5 kOhms.  The DAC that I've selected (ADI 12bit 8 channel) has an internal 2.5V reference and can output 0-5V.  

After researching extensively, an opamp voltage doubler seemed like a good fit.  This worked and was rock solid for about two weeks, but failed after a ~2 day period of continuous operation without warning.  Now the opamp output is close to a correct 2.0 gain but constantly fluctuates as if the output is barely stable and poorly damped.  Has anyone ever seen an opamp fail this way?  

We're using a UA7812 linear regulator to supply 12V (from 24V) to the opamp quad (LM324AN) and admittedly it may not be sufficiently heatsinked (gets wicked hot to touch). Still, the 12V supply is solid at 11.83V and voltages supplied by the DAC appear correct and stable.  The actual resistors on the board are 10k with 0.1% accuracy and each measure 9.95k precisely.  Any advice in solving the problem is tremendously appreciated!  It's essential that this be a robust circuit.

Below is our final opamp configuration (and the part number):


",Liquid Plasmas,https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/68582,"I'm just guessing but your description makes me think that the pneumatic regulator is requiring a lot more current that you think.  I base this on you saying that your 7812 regulator is running so hot.

Couple of things:

1) You don't need the regulator.  The LM324 is good for a maximum supply voltage of 34 (36?) Vdc.

2) Add an emitter follower to the output of the op-amp.  I'd be tempted to use a physically-large transistor just because of dissipation issues.  NPN, TO-220 package, gain  (Hfe) of at least 100.  Collector goes to +24V, Base comes from output of op-amp, Emitter feeds both the pneumatic regulator and the right-hand end of R34.  Note that the transistor is inside the feedback loop and doesn't introduce any error.

Question: is your regulator a voltage-input device or current-input?  My company makes interface cards like this for a variety of different actuators and the ones that we work with are all current-input devices.  We drive them with a low-frequency PWM signal where the output current is proportional to the control input.  This eliminates temperature effects on the actuator's solenoid coil and the vibration that the low-frequency PWM produces reduces stiction in the actuator.

Overall volt drop across the MOSFET will be about 0.9V (from a 12V dc supply) so it'll dissipate about 1W in heat - maybe consider a small heatsink.

If the dc supply is more like 15V dc then the MOSFET will get considerably warmer and maybe you should consider using a buck type constant current regulator.

5437,5437,8630,Sloshing Sound Under Dash,"I have a 2011 Suzuki SX4 Crossover AWD with MT.  Sometimes when I start it up, begin moving forward, or quickly decelerate I can hear what sounds like water (or some other liquid) moving from one place to another (can't quite tell where) under the dash or maybe just behind the firewall.  I took it to the Suzuki service center (almost 2 hour drive from my home), and they told me that the A/C coolant was low.  They refilled it and sent me on my way.  However, I still hear the sloshing sound behind the dash.  Does anyone have any ideas on what this might be?  Thanks.

ADDITIONAL INFO

I've recently noticed that when this ""running water"" sound occurs that it is more prominent when the engine is running faster (e.g. during acceleration).  This leads me to believe maybe this has something to do with the water pump, or some other liquid pump, that is run by the engine and not moving enough liquid to fill the pipe, hence a sloshing / running water sound.
",Jim Fell,https://mechanics.stackexchange.com/users/1211,"My experience (in multiple cars, albeit not your make/model) has been that this sound always means your cooling system is under-filled. If you've emptied your cooling system and refilled it, it can be really hard to get all the air pockets out of the heater core, especially since in many vehicles it's almost as high as the radiator cap and at the opposite end of the system. The best system I know of is to park on a steep grade with the front of the car facing upward, then let the engine run with the radiator cap off. Squeezing the hoses, especially the hoses near the back of the engine compartment that go to the heater core, and varying the throttle can help. You should get bubbles coming up the top of the radiator. Whenever the fluid level drops, add some more coolant, and repeat until you can't get any more bubbling.

By the way, another symptom that might indicate this is your problem is that it's usually associated with poor heater performance (taking a long time to get heat, or only getting warm air, not hot air, out of the heater).

Now, how to highlight EVERY equivalent child in the column....

I know I need to do something with .each(), but I'm unsure where to put it...
",Nicholas Hazel,https://stackoverflow.com/users/2275042,"To add a class for an entire column use td:nth-child(n) where n is the column number.  In your case, the columns you want to highlight vary from 2-4.  You also need to prevent the head, foot, etc. elements from being highlighted, so use .not().

$('table#prices tbody td:nth-child(3)')
  .not('.head,.price,.foot,.category_hover')
  .addClass('vertFilt');


So, for your situation, try this:

$('tr.catTr td').not('.category').hover(function(){

    var priceSel = $(this).index();

    $('table#prices tbody td:nth-child('+priceSel+')')
      .not('.head,.price,.foot,.category_hover')
      .addClass('vertFilt');

    ...

},function(){

    var priceSel = $(this).index();

    $('table#prices tbody td:nth-child('+priceSel+')')
      .not('.head,.price,.foot,.category_hover')
      .removeClass('vertFilt');

Now, how to highlight EVERY equivalent child in the column....

I know I need to do something with .each(), but I'm unsure where to put it...
","To add a class for an entire column use td:nth-child(n) where n is the column number.  In your case, the columns you want to highlight vary from 2-4.  You also need to prevent the head, foot, etc. elements from being highlighted, so use .not().

$('table#prices tbody td:nth-child(3)')
  .not('.head,.price,.foot,.category_hover')
  .addClass('vertFilt');


So, for your situation, try this:

$('tr.catTr td').not('.category').hover(function(){

    var priceSel = $(this).index();

    $('table#prices tbody td:nth-child('+priceSel+')')
      .not('.head,.price,.foot,.category_hover')
      .addClass('vertFilt');

    ...

},function(){

    var priceSel = $(this).index();

    $('table#prices tbody td:nth-child('+priceSel+')')
      .not('.head,.price,.foot,.category_hover')
      .removeClass('vertFilt');

$$\left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^{n-1}\frac{1}{6}.$$

The reason that we simply multiply is that the results on successive tosses of the die are independent.  The die does not remember what results it has come up with in the past.

We can also get the result by using a counting argument. Imagine tossing a die $n$ times, and recording the results. So a record of $4$ tosses might read $4,5,4,1$.

There are $6^n$ possible records of the results of $n$ tosses, all equally likely.  There are $5^{n-1}$ records in which the first $n-1$ results are a non-$3$ and the last result is a $3$. So our probability is

258,258,419,applying convolution theorem swaps quadrants,"For educational purposes I implemented the DFT and inverse DFT for images using OpenCV. Applying the DFT to an image and taking the inverse DFT of the spectrum yields the original image, so this works. I do not rearrange the spectral image from $ [0,N) $ to $ [-N/2, N/2) $.

Now, using the convolution theorem I want to filter an image. I use a 3x3 averaging kernel and pad it with zeroes to the same size as the input image. I then take the DFT of it, and do a piecewise multiplication of the image spectrum and the kernel spectrum. 

The inverse DFT of the resulting spectrum yields an interesting result: The image is filtered (smoothed) correctly, however the quadrants are swapped. Interestingly, if I filter it twice (or any even number), the quadrants are properly arranged. This works for both

$$ \mathcal{F}^{-1}\{ (\mathcal{F}\{I\}\mathcal{F}\{H\})\mathcal{F}\{H\} \} = $$
$$ \mathcal{F}^{-1}\{ \mathcal{F}\{I\}(\mathcal{F}\{H\}\mathcal{F}\{H\}) \} $$

4361,4361,6936,numpy float: 10x slower than builtin in arithmetic operations?,"EDIT:

I rerun the code under the Windows 7 x64 (Intel Core i7 930 @ 3.8GHz).

Again, the code is:

from datetime import datetime
import numpy as np

START_TIME = datetime.now()

# one of the following lines is uncommented before execution
#s = np.float64(1)
#s = np.float32(1)
#s = 1.0

for i in range(10000000):
    s = (s + 8) * s % 2399232

print(s)
print('Runtime:', datetime.now() - START_TIME)


The timings are:


float64: 16.1s
float32: 16.1s
float: 3.2s


Now both np floats (either 64 or 32) are 5 times slower than the built-in float. Still, a significant difference. I'm trying to figure out where it comes from.

EDIT:

Thank you for the answers, they help me understand how to deal with this problem.

But I still would like to know the precise reason (based on the source code perhaps) why the code below runs 10 times slow with float64 than with float.

EDIT:

numpy.float64 is 10 times slower than float in arithmetic calculations. It's so bad that even converting to float and back before the calculations makes the program run 3 times faster. Why? Is there anything I can do to fix it?

I want to emphasize that my timings are not due to any of the following:


the function calls
the conversion between numpy and python float
the creation of objects


I updated my code to make it clearer where the problem lies. With the new code, it would seem I see a ten-fold performance hit from using numpy data types:

from datetime import datetime
import numpy as np

START_TIME = datetime.now()

# one of the following lines is uncommented before execution
#s = np.float64(1)
#s = np.float32(1)
#s = 1.0

for i in range(10000000):
    s = (s + 8) * s % 2399232

print(s)
print('Runtime:', datetime.now() - START_TIME)


The timings are:


float64: 34.56s
float32: 35.11s
float: 3.53s


Just for the hell of it, I also tried:

from datetime import datetime
import numpy as np

START_TIME = datetime.now()

s = np.float64(1)
for i in range(10000000):
    s = float(s)
    s = (s + 8) * s % 2399232
    s = np.float64(s)

print(s)
print('Runtime:', datetime.now() - START_TIME)


The execution time is 13.28 s; it's actually 3 times faster to convert the float64 to float and back than to use it as is. Still, the conversion takes its toll, so overall it's more than 3 times slower compared to the pure-python float.

",max,https://stackoverflow.com/users/336527,"Operating with Python objects in a heavy loop like that, whether they are float, np.float32, is always slow. NumPy is fast for operations on vectors and matrices, because all of the operations are performed on big chunks of data by parts of the library written in C, and not by the Python interpreter. Code run in the interpreter and/or using Python objects is always slow, and using non-native types makes it even slower. That's to be expected.

If your app is slow and you need to optimize it, you should try either converting your code to a vector solution that uses NumPy directly, and is fast, or you could use tools such as Cython to create a fast implementation of the loop in C.

2222,2222,3541,What are the .efires files on OS X Lion's Recovery HD?,"If you mount the Recovery HD that enables OS X Lion File Vault 2, Safari mode, and certain recovery options, you see several .efires files. What format are those and what do they contain?
",Daniel Beck,https://superuser.com/users/22317,"These files contain resources required for displaying the boot screen of OS X Lion before loading the actual operating system or in cases there is no system partition (or when it's broken).

They contain a flat list of files (no hierarchy), and each file has a name of up to 64 characters. The file format is as follows; all numbers are little endian, i.e. least significant byte first.


Two bytes 0x0200 with unknown purpose
Two byte short integer with the number of file entries (e.g. 0x3800 is 56 files)
Now there will be one record for every file entry:

64 bytes ASCII file name, with NUL bytes used to fill up 
4 byte integer offset of the file data within the archive file
4 byte integer length of the file data within the archive file

There is an additional unused record after the file entries consisting of 72 NUL bytes.
Now there is the actual file data. There are no gaps or separators, the file entries described above position the data of all files right next to each other.


The first file's data offset in e.g. an archive file with 56 entries is 0x0C10, or 4108 bytes, by default:

2 bytes unknown + 2 bytes file count + (56+1 file entries) * 72 bytes each = 4108.

The second file's data offset in the same file is 4108 plus the length of the first file's data.

Expires file on OSX lion recovery HD?,"If you mount recovery HD with OS X lion file vault 2, Safari mode, and some recovery options enabled, you will see multiple. Expires files. What are these formats? What do they contain?","These files contain resources required for displaying the boot screen of OS X Lion before loading the actual operating system or in cases there is no system partition (or when it's broken).

They contain a flat list of files (no hierarchy), and each file has a name of up to 64 characters. The file format is as follows; all numbers are little endian, i.e. least significant byte first.


Two bytes 0x0200 with unknown purpose
Two byte short integer with the number of file entries (e.g. 0x3800 is 56 files)
Now there will be one record for every file entry:

64 bytes ASCII file name, with NUL bytes used to fill up 
4 byte integer offset of the file data within the archive file
4 byte integer length of the file data within the archive file

There is an additional unused record after the file entries consisting of 72 NUL bytes.
Now there is the actual file data. There are no gaps or separators, the file entries described above position the data of all files right next to each other.


The first file's data offset in e.g. an archive file with 56 entries is 0x0C10, or 4108 bytes, by default:

2 bytes unknown + 2 bytes file count + (56+1 file entries) * 72 bytes each = 4108.

The second file's data offset in the same file is 4108 plus the length of the first file's data.



These files are recreated automatically whenever you change a setting relevant for the boot login screen, e.g. whether to enable Safari mode in Security &amp; Privacy preference pane in System Preferences).

2996,2996,4776,What is inspiration?,"I've noticed a new mechanic in the 5th edition rules that stands out from the rest. It's called Inspiration.

What is this, what is it good for and how should I as a DM grant it?

It looks like it's simply a way to grant advantage for good role-playing? Is this what it's meant for or does it have more meaning than this?
",wax eagle,https://rpg.stackexchange.com/users/1084,"To players, mechanically, Inspiration is a token you spend to gain advantage on a roll, and that’s all it is. You can only ever have one of these tokens in your possession, which is incentive to use Inspiration up quick and not hoard it. You can also pass that token to others, so you might do that if you’re about to get a second one.

The true reason Inspiration exists, though, is this: it's a mechanical reward for playing the way the Dungeon Master appreciates. The guidance is thin, and that’s what it comes down to, though the guidance doesn't say it in such explicit terms. To support saying that, I’ll quote in full everything (everything) from the Basic Rules about how you acquire Inspiration, barring the example, found on pages 35-36:


  Inspiration is a rule the Dungeon Master can use to reward you for playing your character in a way that’s true to his or her personality traits, ideal, bond, and flaw.
  
  Your DM can choose to give you inspiration for a variety of reasons. Typically, DMs award it when you play out your personality traits, give in to the drawbacks presented by a flaw or bond, and otherwise portray your character in a compelling way. Your DM will tell you how you can earn inspiration in the game.
  
  (further down, after the example...) Additionally, if you have inspiration, you can reward another player for good roleplaying, clever thinking, or simply doing something exciting in the game. When another player character does something that really contributes to the story in a fun and interesting way, you can give up your inspiration to give that character inspiration.


That’s all the guidance there is in the Basic Rules. The guidance suggests to use Inspiration for roleplaying consistent with one’s character sheet, but then gives the DM the freedom to choose to award it however they want:


  Your DM will tell you how you can earn inspiration in the game.


So given that, and the fact the DM is the only one who can create new Inspiration, the entire mechanic comes down to being a device to encourage the players to play the way the DM wants.

That can be used to constructive or destructive ends. People are going to have Opinions about how Inspiration should be used, and what ways are good or bad, but the Basic Rules guidance begins and ends at the above. That guidance certainly seems to fit in with D&amp;D’s established notion that the DM has precedence over the players, and enhances that idea.

Inspiration could be used like Fate points, and awarded as compensation and reward for a player making a mechanically suboptimal choice. (Apparently, the Starter Set suggests as much!) However, D&amp;D 5e presently lacks pretty much all of the mechanical support and a large amount of play guidance that drives Fate points working the way they do. Note the conspicuous absence of “the players can suggest they should probably get it” in the guidance, for instance. Choosing to use Inspiration this way is entirely a choice of the group. The management of Inspiration can also be made by group cooperation, but again, that’s a choice of the group.

It seems the authors could have included Inspiration to be a solution to all those complaints of “my player isn’t roleplaying consistent with their character’s alignment and story!” - since then the DM just penalises that player with no Inspiration whilst they’re doing that. I have Opinions on whether this is healthy for the game, and so will others.

At the end of the day: consider whether there’s behaviour you want to encourage in your game, and if it’s healthy to provide mechanical incentive for players to behave that way. If so, use Inspiration for that.

1124,1124,1765,Can / Should I Use The Admin Session in Frontend,"For some use cases it would be nice to know, when on frontend, if an admin is logged in and to fetch the user's ACLs.

I know that this is not ""easily"" possible, i.e. the frontend and admin sessions are separated on the abstraction level.

I think it should be possible to dig some levels deeper and still access the session.

Additionally I saw work around that pass some tokens from the backend to the frontend - but basically I am not talking about such.


Are there any obvious problems to expect? Or might that just be impossible for any structural reason?
I saw shops that log you out from the backend when you browse the store front - what could be the reason for such security measures? (obviously in this case my whole approach would not work).

",Alex,https://magento.stackexchange.com/users/81,"Let's assume you can get access to the admin session in the frontend, I don't think there will be any issues. Just make sure that you wrap the code (actions or display) around something like this:

if (getTheAdminSession()-&gt;getUser()){//getTheAdminSession() is just a placeholder for the admin session getter
   //code or output here
}


If you have this and the admin is not logged in then there should not be any issues (in theory). Those pieces of code will be skipped.
Now the hard part. I'm not sure how it's possible to gain access to the admin session from the back-end since Magento creates 2 different cookies for them. Maybe read the cookie with the name 'adminhtml' and try to initiate the session with that value. But this will become impossible if the admin is on a separate domain. (I know it usually isn't but it may be).
If you do a simple: 

Mage::getSingleton('admin/session')


on the frontend, the object created from this code will be appended to the session file of the frontend(I only tested with session in files).  The admin session file will not be touched.

I know that this is not ""easily"" possible, i.e. the frontend and admin sessions are separated on the abstraction level.

I think it should be possible to dig some levels deeper and still access the session.

Additionally I saw work around that pass some tokens from the backend to the frontend - but basically I am not talking about such.


Are there any obvious problems to expect? Or might that just be impossible for any structural reason?
I saw shops that log you out from the backend when you browse the store front - what could be the reason for such security measures? (obviously in this case my whole approach would not work).

","Let's assume you can get access to the admin session in the frontend, I don't think there will be any issues. Just make sure that you wrap the code (actions or display) around something like this:

if (getTheAdminSession()-&gt;getUser()){//getTheAdminSession() is just a placeholder for the admin session getter
   //code or output here
}


If you have this and the admin is not logged in then there should not be any issues (in theory). Those pieces of code will be skipped.
Now the hard part. I'm not sure how it's possible to gain access to the admin session from the back-end since Magento creates 2 different cookies for them. Maybe read the cookie with the name 'adminhtml' and try to initiate the session with that value. But this will become impossible if the admin is on a separate domain. (I know it usually isn't but it may be).
If you do a simple: 

Mage::getSingleton('admin/session')


on the frontend, the object created from this code will be appended to the session file of the frontend(I only tested with session in files).  The admin session file will not be touched. 
Your session file will looke something like this:

586,586,913,What's the deal with alignment languages?,"In early D&amp;D, there was the concept of an ""alignment language."" 

The original ""little brown book"" D&amp;D says only:


  Law, Chaos and Neutrality also have common languages spoken by each respectively.


The Holmes basic rules, which come between ""brown book"" and Moldvay say: 


  Lawful good, lawful evil, chaotic good, chaotic evil, and neutrality also have common languages spoken by each respectively. One can attempt to communicate through the common tongue, language particular to a creature class, or one of the divisional languages (lawful good, etc.). While not understanding the language, creatures who speak a divisional tongue will recognize a hostile one and attack.


Moldvay D&amp;D says:


  Dungeons &amp; Dragons, Basic Rules, page B11
  
  Alignment Languages
  
  Each alignment has a secret language of passwords, hand signals, and other body motions.  Player characters and intelligent monsters will always know their alignment languages.  They will also recognize when another alignment language is being spoken, but will not understand it.  Alignment languages are not written down, nor may they be learned unless a character changes alignment.  When this happens, the character forgets the old alignment language and starts using the new one immediately.


What?

So much of Dungeons and Dragons was very generic ""sword and sorcery"" fantasy that these rules always stuck out to me as an extremely sore thumb, or like one of those snails that has been infected by a fungus and begins to pulsate in random colors.  What the heck is going on here?

So, alignment languages show up pretty early in D&amp;D's history.  Every intelligent being that is on the side of Law can communicate.  Every intelligent being that has no particular feelings about Law can, too.  If they experience a profound change in their feelings about this, they can no longer communicate with the people they used to.  It isn't clear how much communication is possible in an alignment language, since Moldvay describes it as ""passwords, hand signals, and other body motions.""

In AD&amp;D 1E, though, there is no such limitation:


  Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons, page 34
  
  Character Languages
  
  In addition to the common tongue, all intelligent creatures able to converse in speech use special languages particular to their alignment. These alignment languages are: Chaotic Evil, Chaotic Good, Chaotic Neutral, lawful Evil, Lawful Good, Lawful Neutral, Neutral Evil, Neutral Good, and Neutrality. The alignment of your character will dictate which language he or she speaks, for only one alignment dialect can be used by a character (cf. CHARACTER CLASSES, The Assassin). If a character changes alignment, the previously known longuage is no longer able to be spoken by him or her.


That cross-reference to the assassin class is there because assassins alone can learn the languages of other alignments.  Probably not all of them, though, because now there are nine instead of three.

In AD&amp;D 2E, the alignment language seems to have been silently dropped, and never spoken of again as far as I know.

When I was ten and played AD&amp;D, the idea of alignment languages struck me as incomprehensible, and today even though I have come to love almost everything about basic and early-Advanced D&amp;D, alignment languages still seem incomprehensible, weird, and unexplained.

What I want to know is this: how were (or are) alignment languages put to use, described, and conceived of in actual play ?  So far, my use of them has always been ""pretend they do not exist.""  I am curious as to how others view and address them.

Also:  where did this bizarre idea come from?  It smacks of being lifted from some fantasy book, but I can't recall ever reading anything like it.

Sometimes when I start it up, begin moving forward, or quickly decelerate I can hear what sounds like water (or some other liquid) moving from one place to another (can't quite tell where) under the dash or maybe just behind the firewall.

However, I still hear the sloshing sound behind the dash.  Does anyone have any ideas on what this might be?  Thanks.

ADDITIONAL INFO

I've recently noticed that when this ""running water"" sound occurs that it is more prominent when the engine is running faster (e.g. during acceleration).  This leads me to believe maybe this has something to do with the water pump, or some other liquid pump, that is run by the engine and not moving enough liquid to fill the pipe, hence a sloshing / running water sound.

Who's answer will get edited with the combined information and get the further upvotes? It just doesn't happen. People don't want to edit questions and mess with someone else's reputation (quite rightly, IMO - how would you feel getting a downvote for something added to your answer that you didn't write?).

One idea to get towards that goal would be to have a community answer on each question, with say a small reputation bump (2 points?) for participating in making it. To prevent reputation inflation, you can only get the 2 points from a given question one time, with a daily limit (say 10 points) for doing it on questions asked by others.

The issue is what to do with the accepted answer? One possibility is to only open the community answer once there is an accepted answer and pre-fill it with that answer.

Does any of this make sense to anyone else?
",Yishai,https://meta.stackexchange.com/users/130225,"My goodness, what fortuitous timing.  I'd been thinking about asking about this very thing.

Besides parsing HTML and working with datetimes, the most frequent question in php seems to be about the mail function.  For the uninitiated, the built-in mailing function is terribly unreliable and provides no feedback when things go wrong.  Combine this with the average quality of shared hosting, and it's no wonder why we get so many questions about sending mail through PHP.

Thankfully there is a known, finite set of solutions to these mailing problems. Many are solved by the various anti-spam techniques documented on Jeff Atwood's well-known blog post about mail deliverability.  Many are solved by using one of a handful of modern third-party mailing libraries instead of the built-in function.

Because there are so many duplicates, it's hard to actually find a good enough duplicate to suggest a closure.  So I was thinking that writing a definitive guide covering the most frequent problems might serve a worthwhile purpose.

Such things have been tried before, like ""Reference - What does this symbol mean in PHP?"", but with mixed success.

I think that spreading the word that such a resource exists might be problematic, followed closely by making sure that questions actually get closed as duplicates when they fit the pattern.  While knowledge would spread slowly throughout frequent contributors, I'm actually far more worried about dupe closures.  Some users don't care for having their questions closed as dupes, and some users think that they are special snowflakes that are totally asking a different question for which the answer is still the same.

  Law, Chaos and Neutrality also have common languages spoken by each respectively.


The Holmes basic rules, which come between ""brown book"" and Moldvay say: 


  Lawful good, lawful evil, chaotic good, chaotic evil, and neutrality also have common languages spoken by each respectively. One can attempt to communicate through the common tongue, language particular to a creature class, or one of the divisional languages (lawful good, etc.). While not understanding the language, creatures who speak a divisional tongue will recognize a hostile one and attack.


Moldvay D&amp;D says:


  Dungeons &amp; Dragons, Basic Rules, page B11
  
  Alignment Languages
  
  Each alignment has a secret language of passwords, hand signals, and other body motions.  Player characters and intelligent monsters will always know their alignment languages.  They will also recognize when another alignment language is being spoken, but will not understand it.  Alignment languages are not written down, nor may they be learned unless a character changes alignment.  When this happens, the character forgets the old alignment language and starts using the new one immediately.


What?

So much of Dungeons and Dragons was very generic ""sword and sorcery"" fantasy that these rules always stuck out to me as an extremely sore thumb, or like one of those snails that has been infected by a fungus and begins to pulsate in random colors.  What the heck is going on here?

So, alignment languages show up pretty early in D&amp;D's history.  Every intelligent being that is on the side of Law can communicate.  Every intelligent being that has no particular feelings about Law can, too.  If they experience a profound change in their feelings about this, they can no longer communicate with the people they used to.  It isn't clear how much communication is possible in an alignment language, since Moldvay describes it as ""passwords, hand signals, and other body motions.""

In AD&amp;D 1E, though, there is no such limitation:


  Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons, page 34
  
  Character Languages
  
  In addition to the common tongue, all intelligent creatures able to converse in speech use special languages particular to their alignment. These alignment languages are: Chaotic Evil, Chaotic Good, Chaotic Neutral, lawful Evil, Lawful Good, Lawful Neutral, Neutral Evil, Neutral Good, and Neutrality. The alignment of your character will dictate which language he or she speaks, for only one alignment dialect can be used by a character (cf. CHARACTER CLASSES, The Assassin). If a character changes alignment, the previously known longuage is no longer able to be spoken by him or her.


That cross-reference to the assassin class is there because assassins alone can learn the languages of other alignments.  Probably not all of them, though, because now there are nine instead of three.

In AD&amp;D 2E, the alignment language seems to have been silently dropped, and never spoken of again as far as I know.

When I was ten and played AD&amp;D, the idea of alignment languages struck me as incomprehensible, and today even though I have come to love almost everything about basic and early-Advanced D&amp;D, alignment languages still seem incomprehensible, weird, and unexplained.

583,583,910,Calculating pH of diprotic and amphoteric solutions,"I am trying to understand this problem and its corresponding solution (complete solution not shown)





First off, from the above one can see that the equilibrium constants when $\ce{H2ASO4-}$ donates and receives a proton are as follows:
\begin{aligned}
\ce{H2AsO4 &amp;&lt;=&gt; HAsO4^{2-} + H+} &amp; K_2 &amp;= 1.1 \cdot 10^{−7}\\
\ce{H2AsO4- + H+ &amp;&lt;=&gt; H3AsO4}    &amp; K_{-1} &amp;= 1.6 \cdot 10^{2}\\
\end{aligned}

However, if this is an amphoteric substance as the solution claims, shouldn't both $K_a$ values be comparable? It seems logical that if it is able to act as both an acid and a base, the equilibrium constants should at least be similar to each other. Instead, one is several order of magnitudes larger than the other? Why can this be true and $\ce{H2ASO4-}$ still be an amphoteric substance?



Next, how did they arrive at the statement


  We approximately have the equality relation: $$\ce{[H3AsO4]} = \ce{[HAsO4^{2−}]}$$


What is the evidence that shows this to be true? Isn't the $K_a$ value of the basic reaction ($1.6 \times 10^2$) much larger than that of the acidic reaction? Why should the concentrations be equal?



Finally, let's say you are calculating the pH for the diprotic substance $\ce{H2S}$, which undergoes the following diassociations:

$$\ce{H2S &lt;=&gt; H+ + HS-}$$
$$\ce{HS- &lt;=&gt; H+ + S^{2-}}$$

To find the pH you would assume that the first reaction is dominant, and that the effects of the second reaction consuming $\ce{HS-}$ are minimal, and then calculate the pH from there — right? 

However, why can't you treat $\ce{HS-}$ as an amphoteric substance (because it can both gain and lose a proton) and then calculate the pH as you would for an amphoteric substance (as seen in the image at the beginning)?
",1110101001,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/users/2142,"I'll address your questions in 3 parts: 

(A) Why amphoteric

(B) How to solve the problem without making unexplained assumptions

(C) Why the solution in the book uses the approximate equality
    $\ce{[H3AsO4]=[HAsO4^{2-}]}$.

PART (A)

An amphoteric species (molecule or ion) is one that can either gain a proton with relative ease, or lose a proton with relative ease. ""Relative ease"" means, for example, that it can happen in aqueous solution. If your species will gain a proton in the presence of enough $\ce{H3O+}$, and if it will lose a proton in the present of enough $\ce{OH-}$, it can certainly be called amphoteric.

Translated into equilibrium constants, if your species has a pKa between 0 and 14, and its conjugate acid (what you get when you protonate it) also has a (necessarily lower) $pK_a$ between 0 and 14, your species will act in aqueous solution as either as an acid (losing a proton in the presence of strong base) or as a base (gaining a proton in the presence of strong acid).

The $pK_a$ of (neutral) arsenic acid is between 2 and 3 (because the equilibrium constant for removing the first proton, $K_1$, is between $10^{-2}$ and $10^{-3}$). The $pK_a$ of the version that lost one proton, $\ce{H2AsO4-}$, is around 7 (from the value of $K_2$). So clearly $\ce{H2AsO4-}$ will gain a proton if the pH is below 1, say, and it will lose a proton if the pH is above 10. This justifies why it's amphoteric.

PART (B)

In a monoprotic acid like HF, all the F appears either as F$^-$ or as HF (two species). You can write down 1 equilibrium equation, a mass balance for F and a charge balance, and solve all three equations simultaneously; when you combine the three you get a quadratic equation that can be solved exactly.

But with a multiprotic acid, things get complicated fast. In this problem you have three equilibrium equations, plus the mass-balance and charge-balance equations.  That's 5 equations in 5 variables.

Fortunately it's possible to combine 4 of them easily, using only high-school algebra. They are the 3 equilibrium equations and the charge balance. This reduces the problem to two variables (the pH and the concentration of one of the arsenic ions) in two equations.

Let's write and combine the 4 equations. There are four arsenic species with varying charges; I'll call their concentrations $A_0,A_1,A_2,A_3$ -- the index denotes the charge (which is 3 minus the number of hydrogens). So $A_0=[\ce{H3AsO4}]$, $A_1=[\ce{H2AsO4-}]$, and so on.

By definition, $A_1[\ce{H^+}]/A_0=K_1$, or equivalently $A_0=A_1[\ce{H^+}]/K_1$. This relates two concentrations, $A_0$ and $A_1$. Similarly $A_1=A_2[\ce{H^+}]/K_2$ and $A_2=A_3[\ce{H^+}]/K_3$.

The important thing is that all these four concentrations are proportional and given one you can find all others if you know the pH. (We don't know the pH, but I'll address that in a moment.)

The charge balance (expressed in moles present in 1 L of solution) is simply 
\begin{equation} 0\,A_0+ 1\,A_1+ 2\,A_2+ 3\,A_3+K_w/[\ce{H^+}]= [\ce{H^+}]+0.1. 
\end{equation}
On the left we have the negative charges, on the right the positive ones. Notes:


The concentration of each arsenic species is multiplied by its charge, obviously.
On the left side, $K_w=10^{-14}$ is the dissociation product of water, and $K_w/[\ce{H^+}]$ represents the concentration of OH$^-$; it will turn out to be negligible, but we don't know that a priori, and including it doesn't make the problem any harder.
The 0.1 on the right comes from Na$^+$ ions; being an alkali metal, sodium does not exist in water solution except in ionic form, so we know [Na$^+$] exactly. This explains something that will be important later: The 0.10 M solution of $\ce{NaH2AsO4}$ is exactly what you obtain by dissolving 0.10 moles of NaOH in one beaker, 0.10 moles of $\ce{H3AsO4}$ in another, and mixing the two, assuming the combined volume is 1 L.


Now we express the left side of (1) in terms of just two
concentrations, $A_3$ and $\ce{[H^+]}$: $$
\begin{aligned}A_1+2\,A_2+3\,A_3&amp;=(\ce{[H^+]}/K_1)\,A_2+2\,A_2+3\,A_3\\
&amp;=(\ce{[H^+]}/K_1+2)\,A_2+3\,A_3\\
&amp;=(\ce{[H^+]}/K_1+2)(\ce{[H^+]}/K_2)\,A_3+3\,A_3\\
&amp;= \bigl((\ce{[H^+]}/K_1+2)(\ce{[H^+]}/K_2)+3\bigr)\,A_3
. \end{aligned} $$

The last line is the key; it allows us to relate the concentration of one arsenic
species to the pH.  With this (and moving the $K_w/\ce{[H+]}$ to the
right)
the charge balance becomes
$$ \bigl((\ce{[H^+]}/K_1+2)(\ce{[H^+]}/K_2)+3\bigr)\,A_3
=\ce{[H^+]}+0.1 -K_w/\ce{[H+]}$$
or again
$$ A_3=
=\frac{\ce{[H^+]}+0.1 -K_w/\ce{[H+]}}{\bigl((\ce{[H^+]}/K_1+2)(\ce{[H^+]}/K_2)+3\bigr).}$$

This look complicated, but it's easy to put into a spreadsheet. The last step is this: The right [H$^+$] is the one that, with $A_3$ calculated as above, obeys the mass balance, $$ A_3 + A_2 + A_1 + A_0 =0.1.$$

At this point we could declare the multiple-choice problem solved, by cheating a bit: take the various proposed values of  [H$^+$] and see which one works.  For answer (a) the value of the sum $ A_3 + A_2 + A_1 + A_0$ is 0.62; for (b) it is  0.128; for (c) it is 0.10165, and for (d) it is 0.100002.  So the best answer is (d).

What if you didn't have multiple choice? Then you'd want to draw a graph or a table, taking (say) every integer value of pH and connecting them.  Here is such a graph: 



The horizontal axis is pH and the vertical one is total arsenic concentration.  The correct pH is where the vertical coordinate is exactly 0.1, and you can get a good idea of its value by eyeballing, or solve by successive approximations.

Note that this method allows you to solve with no more effort the following problem: what is the pH when you add 0.1 mol/L of $\ce{NaH2AsO4}$ (as in the original problem), plus 0.05 mol/L of $\ce{H3AsO4}$?  The only difference is that now you'll be looking for the point on the graph where the vertical coordinate is 0.1+0.05 = 0.15, instead of 0.1.

PART (C)

Why does the book say that $\ce{[H3AsO4]=[HAsO4^{2-}]}$, approximately? And is this a good approximation?

The equality comes from the claim that the ""dominant reactivity"" of $\ce{[H2AsO4-]}$ is $$\ce{2\,H2AsO4- \leftrightharpoons H3AsO4{}+HAsO4^{2-}}.$$ If $\ce{H2AsO4-}$ exchanges protons only with itself, and not with, say, water, then every proton lost by one $\ce{H2AsO4-}$ ion means a proton gained by another $\ce{H2AsO4-}$, and the result is that $\ce{[H3AsO4]}$ and $\ce{[HAsO4^{2-}]}$ are generated in equal amounts.

So given the claim about ""dominant reactivity"", the equality is true, and by the way, the equality implies that the pH is the average of $pK_1$ and $pK_2$. (This follows, by taking logs, from the analysis that I'm guessing your book gives right after the part of the solution you quoted.)

The problem with the claim is that it does not follow from the amphoteric nature of $\ce{H2AsO4^-}$ alone. It requires two additional conditions: You're starting from only $\ce{H2AsO4-}$, and in relatively high concentrations. I'll illustrate why these conditions are necessary:

(1) You have to start with only $\ce{H2AsO4-}$ (plus a counterion that doesn't participate further, like Na$^+$). If you started with some $\ce{H3AsO4}$ in addition, you wouldn't have the equality $\ce{[H3AsO4]=[HAsO4^{2-}]}$, even approximately. Or, to use the example you gave, if you start with H$_2$S the amphoteric character of HS$^-$ wont help you calculate the pH of the resulting mix. On the other hand if you started by dissolving NaHS alone, it would.

(2) You have to start with a strong solution. If the original question had specified a 0.1 mM solution instead of a 0.1 M solution, the resulting H$^+$ concentration would not be $2.5\times 10^{-5}$ anymore but $3.3\times 10^{-6}$, and the equality $\ce{[H3AsO4]=[HAsO4^{2-}]}$ would be off by a factor of 60!

I hope this helps answer your very interesting and perceptive questions.  Don't hesitate to ask for further clarification if necessary!

\ce{H2AsO4 &amp;&lt;=&gt; HAsO4^{2-} + H+} &amp; K_2 &amp;= 1.1 \cdot 10^{−7}\\
\ce{H2AsO4- + H+ &amp;&lt;=&gt; H3AsO4}    &amp; K_{-1} &amp;= 1.6 \cdot 10^{2}\\
\end{aligned}

However, if this is an amphoteric substance as the solution claims, shouldn't both $K_a$ values be comparable? It seems logical that if it is able to act as both an acid and a base, the equilibrium constants should at least be similar to each other. Instead, one is several order of magnitudes larger than the other? Why can this be true and $\ce{H2ASO4-}$ still be an amphoteric substance?



Next, how did they arrive at the statement


  We approximately have the equality relation: $$\ce{[H3AsO4]} = \ce{[HAsO4^{2−}]}$$


What is the evidence that shows this to be true? Isn't the $K_a$ value of the basic reaction ($1.6 \times 10^2$) much larger than that of the acidic reaction? Why should the concentrations be equal?



Finally, let's say you are calculating the pH for the diprotic substance $\ce{H2S}$, which undergoes the following diassociations:

$$\ce{H2S &lt;=&gt; H+ + HS-}$$
$$\ce{HS- &lt;=&gt; H+ + S^{2-}}$$

To find the pH you would assume that the first reaction is dominant, and that the effects of the second reaction consuming $\ce{HS-}$ are minimal, and then calculate the pH from there — right? 

However, why can't you treat $\ce{HS-}$ as an amphoteric substance (because it can both gain and lose a proton) and then calculate the pH as you would for an amphoteric substance (as seen in the image at the beginning)?
","I'll address your questions in 3 parts: 

(A) Why amphoteric

(B) How to solve the problem without making unexplained assumptions

(C) Why the solution in the book uses the approximate equality
    $\ce{[H3AsO4]=[HAsO4^{2-}]}$.

PART (A)

An amphoteric species (molecule or ion) is one that can either gain a proton with relative ease, or lose a proton with relative ease. ""Relative ease"" means, for example, that it can happen in aqueous solution. If your species will gain a proton in the presence of enough $\ce{H3O+}$, and if it will lose a proton in the present of enough $\ce{OH-}$, it can certainly be called amphoteric.

Translated into equilibrium constants, if your species has a pKa between 0 and 14, and its conjugate acid (what you get when you protonate it) also has a (necessarily lower) $pK_a$ between 0 and 14, your species will act in aqueous solution as either as an acid (losing a proton in the presence of strong base) or as a base (gaining a proton in the presence of strong acid).

The $pK_a$ of (neutral) arsenic acid is between 2 and 3 (because the equilibrium constant for removing the first proton, $K_1$, is between $10^{-2}$ and $10^{-3}$). The $pK_a$ of the version that lost one proton, $\ce{H2AsO4-}$, is around 7 (from the value of $K_2$). So clearly $\ce{H2AsO4-}$ will gain a proton if the pH is below 1, say, and it will lose a proton if the pH is above 10. This justifies why it's amphoteric.

PART (B)

In a monoprotic acid like HF, all the F appears either as F$^-$ or as HF (two species). You can write down 1 equilibrium equation, a mass balance for F and a charge balance, and solve all three equations simultaneously; when you combine the three you get a quadratic equation that can be solved exactly.

But with a multiprotic acid, things get complicated fast. In this problem you have three equilibrium equations, plus the mass-balance and charge-balance equations.  That's 5 equations in 5 variables.

Fortunately it's possible to combine 4 of them easily, using only high-school algebra. They are the 3 equilibrium equations and the charge balance. This reduces the problem to two variables (the pH and the concentration of one of the arsenic ions) in two equations.

Let's write and combine the 4 equations. There are four arsenic species with varying charges; I'll call their concentrations $A_0,A_1,A_2,A_3$ -- the index denotes the charge (which is 3 minus the number of hydrogens). So $A_0=[\ce{H3AsO4}]$, $A_1=[\ce{H2AsO4-}]$, and so on.

By definition, $A_1[\ce{H^+}]/A_0=K_1$, or equivalently $A_0=A_1[\ce{H^+}]/K_1$. This relates two concentrations, $A_0$ and $A_1$. Similarly $A_1=A_2[\ce{H^+}]/K_2$ and $A_2=A_3[\ce{H^+}]/K_3$.

The important thing is that all these four concentrations are proportional and given one you can find all others if you know the pH. (We don't know the pH, but I'll address that in a moment.)

The charge balance (expressed in moles present in 1 L of solution) is simply 
\begin{equation} 0\,A_0+ 1\,A_1+ 2\,A_2+ 3\,A_3+K_w/[\ce{H^+}]= [\ce{H^+}]+0.1. 
\end{equation}
On the left we have the negative charges, on the right the positive ones. Notes:


The concentration of each arsenic species is multiplied by its charge, obviously.
On the left side, $K_w=10^{-14}$ is the dissociation product of water, and $K_w/[\ce{H^+}]$ represents the concentration of OH$^-$; it will turn out to be negligible, but we don't know that a priori, and including it doesn't make the problem any harder.
The 0.1 on the right comes from Na$^+$ ions; being an alkali metal, sodium does not exist in water solution except in ionic form, so we know [Na$^+$] exactly. This explains something that will be important later: The 0.10 M solution of $\ce{NaH2AsO4}$ is exactly what you obtain by dissolving 0.10 moles of NaOH in one beaker, 0.10 moles of $\ce{H3AsO4}$ in another, and mixing the two, assuming the combined volume is 1 L.


Now we express the left side of (1) in terms of just two
concentrations, $A_3$ and $\ce{[H^+]}$: $$
\begin{aligned}A_1+2\,A_2+3\,A_3&amp;=(\ce{[H^+]}/K_1)\,A_2+2\,A_2+3\,A_3\\
&amp;=(\ce{[H^+]}/K_1+2)\,A_2+3\,A_3\\
&amp;=(\ce{[H^+]}/K_1+2)(\ce{[H^+]}/K_2)\,A_3+3\,A_3\\
&amp;= \bigl((\ce{[H^+]}/K_1+2)(\ce{[H^+]}/K_2)+3\bigr)\,A_3
. \end{aligned} $$

The last line is the key; it allows us to relate the concentration of one arsenic
species to the pH.  With this (and moving the $K_w/\ce{[H+]}$ to the
right)
the charge balance becomes
$$ \bigl((\ce{[H^+]}/K_1+2)(\ce{[H^+]}/K_2)+3\bigr)\,A_3
=\ce{[H^+]}+0.1 -K_w/\ce{[H+]}$$
or again
$$ A_3=
=\frac{\ce{[H^+]}+0.1 -K_w/\ce{[H+]}}{\bigl((\ce{[H^+]}/K_1+2)(\ce{[H^+]}/K_2)+3\bigr).}$$

This look complicated, but it's easy to put into a spreadsheet. The last step is this: The right [H$^+$] is the one that, with $A_3$ calculated as above, obeys the mass balance, $$ A_3 + A_2 + A_1 + A_0 =0.1.$$

At this point we could declare the multiple-choice problem solved, by cheating a bit: take the various proposed values of  [H$^+$] and see which one works.  For answer (a) the value of the sum $ A_3 + A_2 + A_1 + A_0$ is 0.62; for (b) it is  0.128; for (c) it is 0.10165, and for (d) it is 0.100002.  So the best answer is (d).

What if you didn't have multiple choice? Then you'd want to draw a graph or a table, taking (say) every integer value of pH and connecting them.  Here is such a graph: 



The horizontal axis is pH and the vertical one is total arsenic concentration.  The correct pH is where the vertical coordinate is exactly 0.1, and you can get a good idea of its value by eyeballing, or solve by successive approximations.

Note that this method allows you to solve with no more effort the following problem: what is the pH when you add 0.1 mol/L of $\ce{NaH2AsO4}$ (as in the original problem), plus 0.05 mol/L of $\ce{H3AsO4}$?  The only difference is that now you'll be looking for the point on the graph where the vertical coordinate is 0.1+0.05 = 0.15, instead of 0.1.

PART (C)

Why does the book say that $\ce{[H3AsO4]=[HAsO4^{2-}]}$, approximately? And is this a good approximation?

The equality comes from the claim that the ""dominant reactivity"" of $\ce{[H2AsO4-]}$ is $$\ce{2\,H2AsO4- \leftrightharpoons H3AsO4{}+HAsO4^{2-}}.$$ If $\ce{H2AsO4-}$ exchanges protons only with itself, and not with, say, water, then every proton lost by one $\ce{H2AsO4-}$ ion means a proton gained by another $\ce{H2AsO4-}$, and the result is that $\ce{[H3AsO4]}$ and $\ce{[HAsO4^{2-}]}$ are generated in equal amounts.

So given the claim about ""dominant reactivity"", the equality is true, and by the way, the equality implies that the pH is the average of $pK_1$ and $pK_2$. (This follows, by taking logs, from the analysis that I'm guessing your book gives right after the part of the solution you quoted.)

The problem with the claim is that it does not follow from the amphoteric nature of $\ce{H2AsO4^-}$ alone. It requires two additional conditions: You're starting from only $\ce{H2AsO4-}$, and in relatively high concentrations. I'll illustrate why these conditions are necessary:

(1) You have to start with only $\ce{H2AsO4-}$ (plus a counterion that doesn't participate further, like Na$^+$). If you started with some $\ce{H3AsO4}$ in addition, you wouldn't have the equality $\ce{[H3AsO4]=[HAsO4^{2-}]}$, even approximately. Or, to use the example you gave, if you start with H$_2$S the amphoteric character of HS$^-$ wont help you calculate the pH of the resulting mix. On the other hand if you started by dissolving NaHS alone, it would.

(2) You have to start with a strong solution. If the original question had specified a 0.1 mM solution instead of a 0.1 M solution, the resulting H$^+$ concentration would not be $2.5\times 10^{-5}$ anymore but $3.3\times 10^{-6}$, and the equality $\ce{[H3AsO4]=[HAsO4^{2-}]}$ would be off by a factor of 60!

I hope this helps answer your very interesting and perceptive questions.  Don't hesitate to ask for further clarification if necessary!

When table salt is placed in water, it dissolves due to the polarity of water molecules. When solvation takes place, negatively polar sides of water molecules attach to $\ce{Na+}$ ions, and positively polar sides of water molecules attach to $\ce{Cl-}$ ions. The ions are then carried away by water molecules through diffusion. Since the sodium is now isolated from the chlorine, what keeps it from violently exploding with water in the following chemical reaction?

$$\ce{2Na + 2H2O -&gt; 2 NaOH + H2}$$

Also, since chlorine is poisonous, wouldn't that make drinking salted water extremely lethal?
",Daniel Pendergast,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/users/143,"Sodium ion Na+ should not be confused with metallic sodium Na. They are actually two different chemical species (atoms vs ions), so it is expected that they chemically behave in a different way. The same applies to chlorine Cl and chloride ion Cl-.



Na can ""switch"" to Na+ when it is oxidated; this process of oxidation requires a first ionization energy: Na is supplied with energy in order to become Na+, so it is an endoergonic process; a strongly energetic one. When NaCl dissolves in water, the partially negative side of water molecule bonds weakly with Na+ (intermolecular bond, which has electrostatic character); in a qualitative view, forming a bond is an exoergonic process; since this type of bond is weak, the energy lost by Na+ isn't enough to bring Na+ back to Na.



Cl- has a lower energy than Cl has, so when Cl- forms a weak bond with the partially positive side of water molecule, its energy lowers and it's thermodinamically impossible for it to become Cl.



What you asked about poisoning power of Cl is a Biochemistry topic, but it's reasonable thinking that in a healty person's body at room conditions (e.g. not a scuba diver underwater) the total amount of Cl (Cl• radicals or Cl2 molecules) isn't large enough to cause health issues and it won't appreciably raise by drinking salted water.

3520,3520,5613,"getopt, getopts or manual parsing - what to use when I want to support both short and long options?","Currently I'm writing a Bash script which has the following requirements:


it should run on a wide variety of Unix/Linux platforms
it should support both short and (GNU) long options


I know that getopts would be the preferred way in terms of portability but AFAIK it doesn't support long options.

getopt supports long options but the BashGuide recommends strongly against it:


  Never use getopt(1). getopt cannot handle empty arguments strings, or
  arguments with embedded whitespace. Please forget that it ever
  existed.


So, there still is the option of manual parsing. This is error-prone, produces quite some boilerplate code, and I need to handle errors by myself (I guess getopt(s) do error-handling by themselves).

So, what would be the preferred choice in this case?
",helpermethod,https://unix.stackexchange.com/users/2726,"getopt vs getopts seems to be a religious issue. As for the arguments against getopt in the Bash FAQ:


""getopt cannot handle empty arguments strings"" seems to refer to a known issue with optional arguments, which it looks like getopts doesn't support at all (at least from reading help getopts for Bash 4.2.24). From man getopt:


  getopt(3) can parse long options with optional arguments that are given an empty optional argument (but can not do this for short options). This getopt(1) treats optional arguments that are empty as if they were not present.

it should run on a wide variety of Unix/Linux platforms
it should support both short and (GNU) long options


I know that getopts would be the preferred way in terms of portability but AFAIK it doesn't support long options.

getopt supports long options but the BashGuide recommends strongly against it:


  Never use getopt(1). getopt cannot handle empty arguments strings, or
  arguments with embedded whitespace. Please forget that it ever
  existed.


So, there still is the option of manual parsing. This is error-prone, produces quite some boilerplate code, and I need to handle errors by myself (I guess getopt(s) do error-handling by themselves).

So, what would be the preferred choice in this case?
","getopt vs getopts seems to be a religious issue. As for the arguments against getopt in the Bash FAQ:


""getopt cannot handle empty arguments strings"" seems to refer to a known issue with optional arguments, which it looks like getopts doesn't support at all (at least from reading help getopts for Bash 4.2.24). From man getopt:


  getopt(3) can parse long options with optional arguments that are given an empty optional argument (but can not do this for short options). This getopt(1) treats optional arguments that are empty as if they were not present.



I don't know where the ""getopt cannot handle [...] arguments with embedded whitespace"" comes from, but let's test it:


test.sh:

#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -o errexit -o noclobber -o nounset -o pipefail

",gpuguy,https://security.stackexchange.com/users/16781,"Telephones are not encrypted because back in the late 1800s, when telephone systems were being developed, any sort of encryption was far beyond the capability of the hardware, even if it had been something that people would have thought important.

That said, there are encryption-like devices for telephones known as scramblers, originally developed around the time of World War II.  Modern scramblers are every bit as good as other encryption systems.

These are the minimum fields you can add and these will even help you to scale your app. In the sense if you want to pull or push data from google and FB at that time Access_token and unique_id will help you.

How can I fix this?

Here's the world's simplest Applescript, for the sake of an easy example:

set volume output volume 0
delay 5
set volume output volume 20
delay 5
set volume output volume 0
delay 5
set volume output volume 20
delay 5
set volume output volume 0
delay 5
set volume output volume 20
delay 5
set volume output volume 0


That should take 30 seconds to complete.  If I run it in Script Editor (formerly Applescript Editor) it takes 30 seconds to complete.  But if I save this script as an app, when I launch the app, the delays are ignored and the app takes a fraction of a second to complete.

How can I force Applescript to delay for a specified amount of time before moving on to the next step?  Is this a Yosemite glitch?  Is there a reliable workaround?
","I found a work-around in a German forum post. Add these lines to the top of your script:

use framework ""Foundation""

For free accounts, we only allow access to a particular set of websites -- this is because people were using us to do Bad Things.

We put sites on the whitelist so that free accounts can use them if they have an official publicly-accessible API, and unfortunately Craigslist doesn't have one -- quite the opposite, unfortunately.

4541,4541,7195,The Acidity of the Hydrated Iron (III) Ion,"Why is $\ce{Fe(OH_2)_6^{3+}}$ fairly acidic? This iron has six water molecules coordinated to it. 

In other words, water itself is a very weak acid. But when water is coordinated to iron, it becomes more acidic. I can think of a few reasons; can you think of more? Also are my reasons valid? 

1) Induction. The negative charge generated through loss of the hydrogen proton is stabilized by the coordinated water molecules. Plus the center of the square planar molecule is greatly positively charged (and therefore can handle the negative charge, despite the fact that iron itself is actually electropositive rather than electronegative - at least in iron's ground state). 

2) Size of the ferric ion. The ferric ion is rather big (it is, after all, able to coordinate six water molecules, as opposed to only four for some other metal ions). So whatever positive charge it has after being ionized once is spread out over a large surface area and that makes entire compound relatively stable. 

3) Oxidation state of the central ferric ion - positive 3. This indicates a high degree of ionic character in the coordination bonds. Withdrawal of electron density from the water molecules makes the hydrogens even more positively charged and thus even more electrophilic.  

4) Positive charge density of the central ferric atom. Coulomb's law is in (significant) effect here. Positive and positive. Like charges repel. Kicking off a hydrogen proton - no problem. 


",Dissenter,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/users/5084,"When a water molecule coordinates to $\ce{Fe^3+}$, one non-bonded $sp^3$ hybrid orbital (with one of the 2 lone pairs) of oxygen overlaps with an empty $d$ or $p$ orbital of $\ce{Fe^3+}$. Electron density is transferred from oxygen to iron, and due to the electronegativity of oxygen, the polarization of the $\ce{O-H}$ bond in the water ligand is increased (more electron density is ""pulled"" from $\ce{H}$ towards $\ce{O}$). The hydrogens are more positively polarized than in a free (uncoordinated) water molecule, and this increases their electrophilic character and acidity to the point that they are readily abstracted by solvent (non-coordinated) $\ce{H2O}$ in aqueous solution:

$$\ce{Fe(H2O)6^3+ + H2O \rightleftharpoons  Fe(H2O)5(OH)^2+ + H3O+}$$

You have mentioned ion charge (oxidation state) and charge density (which is proportional to ion size) of the metal center as potential factors of influence. One can expect that with increased charge and/or charge density, the polarization of the water ligands also increases, and thus the aquo complex should be more acidic.

1681,1681,2656,Calculating pH of diprotic and amphoteric solutions,"I am trying to understand this problem and its corresponding solution (complete solution not shown)





First off, from the above one can see that the equilibrium constants when $\ce{H2ASO4-}$ donates and receives a proton are as follows:
\begin{aligned}
\ce{H2AsO4 &amp;&lt;=&gt; HAsO4^{2-} + H+} &amp; K_2 &amp;= 1.1 \cdot 10^{−7}\\
\ce{H2AsO4- + H+ &amp;&lt;=&gt; H3AsO4}    &amp; K_{-1} &amp;= 1.6 \cdot 10^{2}\\
\end{aligned}

However, if this is an amphoteric substance as the solution claims, shouldn't both $K_a$ values be comparable? It seems logical that if it is able to act as both an acid and a base, the equilibrium constants should at least be similar to each other. Instead, one is several order of magnitudes larger than the other? Why can this be true and $\ce{H2ASO4-}$ still be an amphoteric substance?



Next, how did they arrive at the statement


  We approximately have the equality relation: $$\ce{[H3AsO4]} = \ce{[HAsO4^{2−}]}$$


What is the evidence that shows this to be true? Isn't the $K_a$ value of the basic reaction ($1.6 \times 10^2$) much larger than that of the acidic reaction? Why should the concentrations be equal?



Finally, let's say you are calculating the pH for the diprotic substance $\ce{H2S}$, which undergoes the following diassociations:

$$\ce{H2S &lt;=&gt; H+ + HS-}$$
$$\ce{HS- &lt;=&gt; H+ + S^{2-}}$$

To find the pH you would assume that the first reaction is dominant, and that the effects of the second reaction consuming $\ce{HS-}$ are minimal, and then calculate the pH from there — right? 

However, why can't you treat $\ce{HS-}$ as an amphoteric substance (because it can both gain and lose a proton) and then calculate the pH as you would for an amphoteric substance (as seen in the image at the beginning)?
",1110101001,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/users/2142,"
  First, I have read that $\ce{H2AsO4-}$ is a amphiprotic substances in
  that the dominant reactivity is $$\ce{2H2AsO4- &lt;=&gt; H3AsO4 + HAsO4^{2-}}$$
  
  However, this also seems to be a polyprotic substance. 


The two terms - amphiprotic and polyprotic - aren't mutually exclusive. Amphiprotic substances can simply behave as both Bronsted-Lowry acids and bases in that they can both give up and release hydrogen protons. 

Polyprotic acids have multiple protons to donate. For example, phosphoric acid is triprotic.  

Often times amphiprotic substances will be polyprotic. By nature of being able to lose multiple protons, these substances are also able to gain multiple protons. 


  Why is one $K_a$ value so much larger than the other? If this were a
  amphoteric substance shouldn't the $K_a$ values for both be
  comparable?


Good observation. This lies with Coulomb's law. Think about it. A neutral molecule kicks off a hydrogen proton. Now you have the first conjugate base. The first conjugate base is negatively charged. It also attempts to kick off a proton. Which do you think is easier? Clearly the first process is. Remember that oppositely charged particles attract. This explains why $K_{a1}$ values for polyprotic molecular acids are generally significantly larger than corresponding $K_{a2}$ values. 

Just because the $K_a$ values differ by several orders of magnitude doesn't mean the ion/molecule can't be amphiprotic. 


  Next, I researched how to calculate the $\mathrm{pH}$ value for
  amphiprotic substances, and I found this page that details how to
  do so, and the end result is that the $\mathrm{pH} = \sqrt{K_1 K_2}$.
  Why is the $\mathrm{pH}$ independent of the concentrations?


First, amphiprotic substances don't have $\mathrm{pH}$ values by themselves. In solution, then yes. 


  Further, I also found another page that gets to the same result in a
  different manner. They start by saying:
  
  
    We approximately have the equality relation: $$\ce{[H3AsO4]} = \ce{[HAsO4^{2−}]}$$
  


Regarding the validity of the quoted statement: just note the main reaction stoichiometry. And the magnitude of the main reaction's K. The main K can be found through dividing the Ka of the reactant acid by the Ka of the product acid. 

\begin{aligned}
\ce{H2AsO4^{−} + H2AsO4^{−} &amp;&lt;=&gt; H3AsO4 + HAsO4^2-}\\
K_\mathrm{rxn} &amp;= \frac{K_a(\ce{H2AsO4^{−}})}{K_a(\ce{H3AsO4})}\\
\end{aligned}


  Next, why can't this method of calculating pH in amphoteric acids be
  used for diprotic acids? I found another page that details how to do
  so but even though the reactions are essentially similar to those for
  amphiprotic acids, the end result is different. Why does the same line
  of reasoning as used for deriving the formula for amphoteric
  substances fail for diprotic/polyprotic acids?


For diprotic acid, just keep $K$ value magnitudes in mind. This statement applies to diprotic and polyprotic acids:

$$K_{a2}(\ce{H3AsO4}) = \ce{[HAsO4^{2−}]}$$

First off, from the above one can see that the equilibrium constants when $\ce{H2ASO4-}$ donates and receives a proton are as follows:
\begin{aligned}
\ce{H2AsO4 &amp;&lt;=&gt; HAsO4^{2-} + H+} &amp; K_2 &amp;= 1.1 \cdot 10^{−7}\\
\ce{H2AsO4- + H+ &amp;&lt;=&gt; H3AsO4}    &amp; K_{-1} &amp;= 1.6 \cdot 10^{2}\\
\end{aligned}

However, if this is an amphoteric substance as the solution claims, shouldn't both $K_a$ values be comparable? It seems logical that if it is able to act as both an acid and a base, the equilibrium constants should at least be similar to each other. Instead, one is several order of magnitudes larger than the other? Why can this be true and $\ce{H2ASO4-}$ still be an amphoteric substance?



Next, how did they arrive at the statement


  We approximately have the equality relation: $$\ce{[H3AsO4]} = \ce{[HAsO4^{2−}]}$$


What is the evidence that shows this to be true? Isn't the $K_a$ value of the basic reaction ($1.6 \times 10^2$) much larger than that of the acidic reaction? Why should the concentrations be equal?



Finally, let's say you are calculating the pH for the diprotic substance $\ce{H2S}$, which undergoes the following diassociations:

$$\ce{H2S &lt;=&gt; H+ + HS-}$$
$$\ce{HS- &lt;=&gt; H+ + S^{2-}}$$

To find the pH you would assume that the first reaction is dominant, and that the effects of the second reaction consuming $\ce{HS-}$ are minimal, and then calculate the pH from there — right? 

However, why can't you treat $\ce{HS-}$ as an amphoteric substance (because it can both gain and lose a proton) and then calculate the pH as you would for an amphoteric substance (as seen in the image at the beginning)?
","
  First, I have read that $\ce{H2AsO4-}$ is a amphiprotic substances in
  that the dominant reactivity is $$\ce{2H2AsO4- &lt;=&gt; H3AsO4 + HAsO4^{2-}}$$
  
  However, this also seems to be a polyprotic substance.

I have created a site template from a site which has simply Wiki Pages, Lists and Libraries. Lists are using some Content Types which already exist in parent site.

I can create a site using that template, it creates successfully, work well but application pages like settings(_layouts/settings.aspx), permission, etc. pages are throwing ""Unexpected error occurred"".

FYI: I am not using Publishing pages but few site at top level are using Publishing feature.

Please help!

Thank you,

","This forum post was helpful and I resolved my issue.

The issue was due to alternate css I used. Here are the steps that I used to fix:  

Step 1: Reset to default CSS so that template won't include alternate css file:


  Site Actions > Site Settings > Master Page


Alternate CSS URL:
Select option: Use Microsoft SharePoint Foundation default styles
Check :  Reset all subsites to inherit this alternate CSS URL
Hit OK  

Step 2: Create site template

2981,2981,4741,Can monsters make multiple attacks in a single action?,"In the bestiary for the new D&amp;D Next playtest packets, some creatures look as though they get multiple attacks per round.


  e.g.: An owl bear gets Melee Attack: Claws +5/+5 (etc.) and Bite +5 (etc.) along with a special power says that if both claw attacks hit,
  then extra damage is done.


However, the basic rules don't seem to cover this situation. I can't tell if the owlbear is able to use both claws AND bite in one action, or if it can only use one claw OR a bite, or 2 claws OR A bite.

So, do monsters get multiple attacks per action? And what are the rules for the owl bear, or other monsters that have a +x/+x description for an attack?

One possible way to answer this question would be to explain how this worked in earlier editions of D&amp;D. If you can tell from the rules test how this is supposed to work, that would be a better answer.

5848,5848,9266,"How to extract unknown packet from collision between said packet and another, known packet?","I need to apply successive interference cancellation (SIC) to an RF signal which is the result of collisions between 2 or more unsynchronised packets. For this question let's just assume that the number of packets is 2.

In SIC, you store the collided packets until one of the packets are repeated and use the 'clean' packet to extract the other packet from the collided data.

My question is, what techniques can be used to extract an unknown packet from a collision between that packet and a known packet?

How do you deal with the packet sources not being synchronised?

Going through the possible tags for this question, it seems that 'deconvolution' is relevant. 

In case it is relevant, the context is RFID tag inventory, the channel access mechanism is framed slotted ALOHA (FSA) random access, the carrier is 868 MHz (EU) and subcarrier is 256 kHz.

Thank you.
",Videre,https://dsp.stackexchange.com/users/11101,"As JRE said, deconvolution is not what you need.  You need to subtract the known signal from the combined signal to leave the unknown signal by itself.

If the signals are baseband signals (I'm aware that yours are modulated- I will get to that later in the answer) then you need to know when the known signal started and how strong it is.  You can get an estimate of both of those things through cross-correlation.  You cross-correlate the combined signal with a clean reconstruction of the known signal.  You should get a strong peak at the location of the known signal.  From this you can determine when the signal started.  You can also estimate the signal amplitude using the peak's amplitude.

$$
y[n] = \sum\limits_m x[m]r[n+m]
$$

This is the definition of cross-correlation, where x[n] is the combined signal, r[n] is the reconstructed known signal, and y[n] is the cross-correlation.

$$
y[n] = \sum\limits_m (s_1[m] + s_2[m] + noise[n])r[n+m] \approx \sum\limits_m s_2[m]r[m]
$$

In this equation I have broken x[n] into its constituent parts: $s_1[n]$ (the unknown signal, $s_2[n]$ (the known signal), and noise.  If we assume that $s_1[n]$ does not correlate strongly with $s_2[m]$ then we can simply disregard $s_1[n]$ and the noise term with the understanding that they will both likely add some error to the result.

So, the peak's amplitude is approximately equal to $\sum\limits_m s_2[m]r[n+m]$.  Since you know $r[n]$ completely, you can use this value to determine the amplitude of $s_2[n]$.

Once you know the start time and amplitude of $s_2[n]$, you can subtract it out of $x[n]$, leaving only $s_1[n]$, the noise term, and whatever error was in your estimate of $s_2[n]$.

If the packets are modulated the same basic process is followed, except you will also have to find/determine any carrier offset in $s_2[n]$, and it's phase.  The phase you can get from the cross-correlation peak's phase.  The carrier offset you can find using the fourth power technique (for PSK signals), or by searching for the best cross-correlation result at various carrier offsets.

Sometimes I'll give it a good month- I start by constructing perverse sequences and little heuristic arguments- when I'm onto something good I'll pursue it 'til it's rigorous: more often than not it turns out to be precisely the case disallowed by the theorem's assumptions. 

After a while I start to paint my counter-arguments in generalities ""An A is not a B if A has perversity X"" and I look for the exact line in the proof where 'perversity X' is (perhaps implicitly) dealt with and debunked. Sooner or later I start to see what every line in the proof is for, moreover I start to see why it must be true.

I have a question that I've been thinking about for a long time.

How can you assure yourself that you've fully comprehended a concept or the true meaning of a theorem in mathematics?

I mean how can you realize that you totally get the concept and it's time to move on to the next pages of the book you're reading?

Thanks in advance for your responses.
","I like to try and disprove results I am trying to understand. 

Sometimes I'll give it a good month- I start by constructing perverse sequences and little heuristic arguments- when I'm onto something good I'll pursue it 'til it's rigorous: more often than not it turns out to be precisely the case disallowed by the theorem's assumptions. 

After a while I start to paint my counter-arguments in generalities ""An A is not a B if A has perversity X"" and I look for the exact line in the proof where 'perversity X' is (perhaps implicitly) dealt with and debunked. Sooner or later I start to see what every line in the proof is for, moreover I start to see why it must be true.

It may not be the fastest way to learn, but it's certainly entertaining if you're having trouble sleeping!

",Berins,https://superuser.com/users/452454,"First, let's make something clear. hosts file doesn't prevent domain name resolution, it only overrides what domains resolve to.

When some program tries to resolve 101com.com, your OS would normally query DNS servers for its IP address. But, if you have it in your hosts file, then 101com.com will be resolved to provided IP without DNS query.

Domain name resolution still happens, but it's handled inside OS. All programs that try to resolve domains will receive IP addresses in response, but it will be the IP you have provided instead of DNS provided one.

101com.com is not ""blacklisted"", you have only redirected its traffic to your own machine (127.0.0.1).

Now, how can we explain 101com.com in netstat's output? That's pretty simple. netstat will try to reverse lookup domain names for IPs in the third column.

","I cannot offer a 100% working solution but I have two points which you might want to check.

First, try adding umask to the fstab line. I think this causes the permission error. umask adds correct permission to all files (644) and directories (755) when mounting. You must remount the NTFS folder!

UUID=XXDDXDDXDDDXDDDD /media/myname/lable ntfs user,exec,uid=www-data,gid=www-data,umask=022 0 2


You need to make sure, the www-data user is able to cd into the destination folder:

sudo su www-data -s bash &amp;&amp; cd /media/myname/lable


Second, make sure ""FollowSymlinks"" is allowed on the specific folder, I think you have that already, but try anyways:

&lt;Directory ""/media/myname/lable/""&gt;
    Options FollowSymLinks +Indexes
    AllowOverride None
    Order allow,deny
    Allow from all
&lt;/Directory&gt;
&lt;Directory ""/var/www""&gt;
    Options FollowSymLinks +Indexes
    AllowOverride None
    Order allow,deny
    Allow from all
&lt;/Directory&gt;

1333,1333,2101,VB.net Service Programming and using TCP Sockets,"I am having a problem and I was curious if anyone could help me solve it.  I took a tutorial for client-server socket programming for VB.NET.  I then tried to implement it using a service rather than a program.  I understand how it works as a program, but when I try to port it over to a service it doesn't work.  When I run the service it starts and stops instantly.  It never makes a connection.  Unfortunately, I am not that great of VB.net programmer but so far I am liking it a lot for rapid development of programs.

The idea of this service is to:


run when the computer starts
grab the name of the PC
Send the name of the PC to the server

a.   the server then takes the name and looks it up in a database

b.   returns the time that the client machine is suppose to back up
The client machine then does the math for the current time and the time it’s suppose to backup &amp; put everything in ms.
Then the machine backs up at that specified time by running a dos command to launch the program.


Now to answer a question that I have found common in the forums.  Why don't I use task scheduler.  Well I did use task schedule and had the server control times to machines that way.  However, some computers will go into a dormant state, I would say this dormant state affects 20% of the machines.  No this dormant state is not sleep mode and not hibernation.  The computers are on and they are react very quickly to mouse movement.  I created a service that writes the time to a file on the C:\ and this has always worked.  So now I have decided to have a service on the client machine and have it communicate with the server.

I have collected very little information about creating service and network socket programming.  Unfortunately, I haven’t found anything that ties the 2 together.  I found a vb.net client-server program that does what I want, but I want it as a service not a program.  I found a temporary solution with creating files using PSEXEC from the server, but this process is just so umm unsophisticated.

I did the next best thing and I went and reviewed the Microsoft library for sockets and tried to build my own service based on what makes sense.  Still nothing works.  If you know of any books, resources, have any advice, etc. any help you can give me will be greatly appreciated.  Thank you for your assistance.

Below you will find my code.  At this point all I care about doing is making the connections between clients and the server.  I can go back to figuring out the rest and tweek the code from there.

I ran into that problem when trying to write a similar service--in my case I was trying to auto-detect the IP address to use, and it turns out it was inadvertently selecting my IPv6 loopback address and failing to bind. An error in the event log hinted at this for me.

","To find out why it's starting and then stopping, you might try looking in the Application event log after trying to start the service. Could be running into an error on (or just after) startup that is causing the service to stop.

I ran into that problem when trying to write a similar service--in my case I was trying to auto-detect the IP address to use, and it turns out it was inadvertently selecting my IPv6 loopback address and failing to bind. An error in the event log hinted at this for me.

5340,5340,8482,Linearity of push forward $F_*$,"How can I prove the linearity of $F_*$? What does $F_*$ eat?


  If $N$ is smooth manifolds and $F: M \to N$ is a smooth map, for each $p \in M$ we define a map $F_*: T_pM \to T_{F(p)}N$, called the push-forward associated with $F$, by
  $$(F_*X)(f) = X(f \circ F).$$

",Tumbleweed,https://math.stackexchange.com/users/77895,"It often times just helps to write out exactly what the formula you are trying to get in the end looks like, and then interpreting that.

For example, you are trying to show that $F_\ast(\alpha X)=\alpha F_\ast(X)$. So, what does the left-hand side do to elements of $T_{F(p)}N$? Well, as you pointed out

$F_\ast(\alpha X)(f)=(\alpha X)(f\circ F)$

what does the right-hand side look like?

$(\alpha F_\ast(X))(f)=\alpha F_\ast(X)(f)=\alpha X(f\circ F)$

Make sense?

EDIT(to answer Jellybean's questions in the comment): I am not entirely sure what you mean here. The tangent space of $M$ at $p$ is thought of, or at least the book you're reading thinks of it, as the $\mathbb{R}$-derivations of germs of smooth functions $\mathcal{G}_{M,p}$ at $p$. A smooth map $F:M\to N$ allows one to take a derivation $X$ of $\mathcal{G}_{M,p}$ and ""push it forward"" to a derivation of $\mathcal{G}_{N,F(p)}$. The way it does this is basically the observation that if you start with an element of $\mathcal{G}_{N,F(p)}$, germs of smooth functions on $N$ at $F(p)$, there is a way to pull this back to an element of $\mathcal{G}_{M,p}$. Namely, if $f\in\mathcal{G}_{N,F(p)}$ then $f\circ F\in\mathcal{G}_{M,p}$. Thus, if you start with a derivation $X$ of $\mathcal{G}_{M,p}$ you want to use this to produce a derivation of $\mathcal{G}_{N,F(p)}$. 

But, a derivation of $\mathcal{G}_{N,F(p)}$ eats in, well, obviously, elements of $\mathcal{G}_{N,F(p)}$. Thus, $X$ itself doesn't act on $\mathcal{G}_{N,F(p)}$. But, we observed above that we have a method of taking an element of $\mathcal{G}_{N,F(p)}$ and pulling it back to an element of $\mathcal{G}_{M,p}$, which is the set of things that $X$ does eat. So, to create a derivation of $\mathcal{G}_{N,F(p)}$, which let's call $F_\ast(X)$, of $\mathcal{G}_{N,F(p)}$ we merely take an element of $\mathcal{G}_{N,F(p)}$, pull it back to $\mathcal{G}_{M,p}$ by the rule $f\mapsto f\circ F$, and now that we're back on $X$'s diningroom table we feed it to $X$ to get a real number out. Thus, the derivation $F_\ast(X)$ all put together acts as $f\mapsto f\circ F\mapsto X(f\circ F)$. You can check that this definition of $F_\ast(X)$ does, in fact, produce a a derivation of $\mathcal{G}_{N,F(p)}$. 

Thus, the association $X\mapsto F_\ast(X)$ produces a map $F_\ast:T_p M\to T_{F(p)}N$. This map, the map $F_\ast$, is the pushforward. It is a linear map between tangent spaces.

Why is Kosher salt better to use?
",Archey,https://cooking.stackexchange.com/users/15419,"The reason people choose Kosher/Sea/Rock salt over table salt is mainly down to the crystal size and the lack of additives like iodine.

Kosher salt is less soluble and less dense than table salt.

The large crystals in these salts mean that unless there is a fair bit of water present they don't completely dissolve. This means it is less likely you'll over salt steak even if it's caked in crystals.

Table salt will dissolve with far less water present and will, therefore, get absorbed more easily into the meat. 

Also the lower density means you can liberality sprinkle Kosher/Sea/Rock salt on things and even if it does all dissolve you've actualy added less salt than you would think. It looks like a lot but 1g of Kosher/Sea/Rock salt takes up a lot more space than 1g of table salt.

65,65,99,"Can a card be un-cast, if the player realises it was a bad decision?","Let's say a player casts a spell, completely allows it to resolve, and accepts its consequences - then realises that was a bad idea, or there was something better to do. That player realises there was a better card to play, or that the spell will do something they don't want to happen, such as deal enough damage to that player to kill them.

Does the caster have the opportunity to go back and fix that mistake (and to stay alive), even though they already accepted the consequences?
",Marath the commander,https://boardgames.stackexchange.com/users/7225,"Depends on what you mean by ""misused"".

If the card was cast illegally, such as trying to Shock a creature with Hexproof, the game is rewound to the point immediately before the spell was cast. This does depend on how much time has passed- if so much time has passed that fixing it would be difficult, just correct anything currently illegal and continue the game.

If a player just did something silly, like trying to Shock a creature that actually had 3 toughness because of a Glorious Anthem, the answer is no in any tournament setting. Once you've taken an action, you can't suddenly change your mind. In casual play, it's up to the opponent. If the opponent decides it's sporting to allow take-backs, they can allow them.

1129,1129,1770,I can't find a PFET protected against ESD,"I like to use OmniFETs for MOSFETs because they have internal protection against ESD so I am unlikely to damage them while handling and then when they don't work I don't have to wonder if it was damaged or I have a circuit mistake.  These are n-channel FETs, but now I need a p-channel FET.  I tried to find one Mouser and Digikey, but was unsuccessful.  Is there such a thing?

It would basically be a MOSFET and a diode in one package.  Other things like over-current and over-temperature protection would also be nice, but are less important.
",mccoyn,https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/7808,"I would like to add that it seems to me like a very futile effort to only use ESD-protected FETs. If you have a FET that is large enough to hold in your hand, it is already fairly rugged by virtue of physics. Gate and drain-source capacitance make sure that whatever charge you can inject into the device will not cause large enough voltages to spark over.

But much more importantly: when handling any other active device, you are probably holding tens, hundreds, thousands of tiny little FETs in your hand, each and every one of them orders of magnitude more sensitive to ESD. There is usually some protection on the outgoing pins, but I'm afraid that the only way to really set yourself free from the worry of ESD is to regard proper ESD safety:


Regard air humidity at all times, try to keep it high (70%+). Air humidity dissipates static charges extremely effectively.
When dealing with sensitive devices - something that is almost always mentioned in the datasheet or on the package if this is especially so - wear an ESD dissipative wrist band connected to an ESD mat, which in turn is connected to your mains electricity ground with an appropriate connector. ESD mats nowadays are very inexpensive.
Regard your clothing. Do not wear clothing with long exposed fibers (e.g. wool).

The main method always is a static method so in the class that the main method exists all variables and methods are declared static if you have to call them in the main method. Also I have noticed that in order to call a static method from another class you do not need to create an object of that you can use the class name.

5295,5295,8409,Why are magnetic fields so much weaker than electric?,"In EM radiation, the magnetic field is $ 3*10^8$ times smaller than the electric field, but is it valid to say it's ""weaker"". These fields have different units, so I don't think you can compare them, but even so it seems like we only interact with the electric field of EM radiation, not the magnetic field. Why is this? 
",aPhysicist,https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/51971,"It's a quirk of units: notice that the conversion between them is dimensionful, and has the value $3\times 10^8\,\mathrm{m/s}$, which is the speed of light.
In the CGS system both fields have the same units, and field-squared is an energy density.

In SI units, the energy density for a configuration of fields is given by

which tells you that, given the field strength ratio $c$ you have calculated for electromagnetic waves, the energy of an EM wave is shared equally between its electric and magnetic components.

We do tend to usually think about the interaction between EM waves and materials in terms of the electric field component, but that's a bias because it's relatively easy to liberate free electric charges, and magnetic interactions only occur at second order.

",Aaron,https://diy.stackexchange.com/users/2669,"I had exactly the same issue with my dishwasher.  Standing water at the bottom after the wash cycle almost every time, yet the dishwasher appeared to be draining correctly.

Nevertheless, the first thing to verify is that the dishwasher is indeed draining properly.  Start a cycle to partially fill the washer, then manually engage the drain cycle.  Does the water drain quickly and completely?   If you're so inclined, you can (carefully) leave the door open while the dishwasher is draining and hold down the door lock mechanism with a small screw driver so that you can watch the process.  Another option is to disconnect the drain from your disposal and place the end into a bucket to observe how the water is draining.  It's also a good opportunity to clean out any sludge that may have formed in drain hose.

If the draining appears to be functioning normally (as it was in my case) the next step is to verify the filter, food chopper blade and mesh grate that is in front of the sump pump/pump inlet housing is not clogged - this is slightly more involved, but still fairly easy to do.  Here's a video to give you the general idea of the process:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRDbTgBOtIE.  This is not for your model specifically, but it should be fairly close.  

In my case, the mesh grate was almost 100% clogged with debris and hard water deposits, and the food chopper blade had a piece of string wrapped around it that kept it from spinning freely (no idea how that got there).  After soaking the grate in a vinegar solution, cleaning the it with a toothpick and unwrapping the string from the blade, I haven't had any more issues with water remaining in the dishwasher.

Total power consumption (including FTDI chip) is near by 80 mA /h (at 5V). My op-amps need well regulated 5V power (single supply). Here comes the time to design power supply. 
USB Vcc pin is connected to the FT232RL Vcc and MCU's Vcc. The question is this how i should use USB's Vcc pin? 

First connecting USB Vcc to LDO regulator IC like AMS1117 and powering both FTDI IC and MCU + Op-amps with AMS1117's regulated output is good?

",user30878,https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/30878,"The XX1117 is not really an LDO regulator, more of a medium-drop-out. 

You need to give it quite a bit more input voltage than you expect out of it. So if your circuitry is happy with 3V (say), you may be okay. You can only count on 4.35V at the USB connector, and the regulator can use as much as 1.3V depending on current etc. so that leaves you with 3.05V. At 80mA, 3.3V may be acceptable, but you'll have to sharpen your pencil to figure that out. 

If you want to create a low-noise well-regulated 5V supply from a USB input, you would have to boost the input to something like 5.5V and use a true LDO or to more like 6.5V and use an XX1117 regulator. At 80% efficiency that means you'd be at about 150mA input current. That's acceptable, but you're supposed to negotiate for current above 100mA. Possibly the FTDI chip does that for you. If you're dealing with two supply voltages in your system you may have to have voltage translators and so on, and the details will vary a lot depending on exactly what you are trying to accomplish. 

Maybe you can operate all the digital stuff from the USB Vcc and use regulated 3.0V or 3.3V for the analog stuff. That would be my first plan of attack.

4183,4183,6673,"Add an admin page, but don't show it on the admin menu","I have a custom plugin 'Charts' that has it's own menu. In that menu are links to the 3 pages for the plugin - 'Charts', 'Add Chart' and 'Edit Chart'. However, I don't want to display the link to 'Edit Chart'.

Here is how I add the page in question -

$this-&gt;pagehook = add_submenu_page('charts', __('Edit Chart'), __('Edit Chart'), 'edit_charts', 'edit-chart', array(&amp;$this, 'on_show_page'));


I've scoured the internet, and cannot find a way to do this (that works). It's possible to remove whole top level menus (not what I need), and you can remove individual entries from the $submenu global (but doing that also removes the registered capability), so no one can access the page -

global $submenu;
if(!empty($submenu['charts'])) : foreach($submenu['charts'] as $key =&gt; $page) :
        if($page[0] === 'Edit Chart') :

            /** Removes all permissions to access the page */
            //unset($submenu['charts'][$key]);              
            /** Removes the title, but the menu entry still exists, so it looks odd */
            $submenu['charts'][$key][0] = '';

        endif;
    endforeach;
endif;


I've looked in to hiding it via CSS, but can't see a way to do that through the HTML that Wordpress generates -

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""admin.php?page=edit-chart"" tabindex=""1""&gt;Edit Chart&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;


I've also considered jQuery, but that has similar limitations to the CSS route, plus I refust to believe that I am the only one that has ever wished to do this - there must be a way, I just can't find it!

Any hints and tips appriciated.

I've scoured the internet, and cannot find a way to do this (that works). It's possible to remove whole top level menus (not what I need), and you can remove individual entries from the $submenu global (but doing that also removes the registered capability), so no one can access the page -

global $submenu;
if(!empty($submenu['charts'])) : foreach($submenu['charts'] as $key =&gt; $page) :
        if($page[0] === 'Edit Chart') :

            /** Removes all permissions to access the page */
            //unset($submenu['charts'][$key]);              
            /** Removes the title, but the menu entry still exists, so it looks odd */
            $submenu['charts'][$key][0] = '';

        endif;
    endforeach;
endif;


I've looked in to hiding it via CSS, but can't see a way to do that through the HTML that Wordpress generates -

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""admin.php?page=edit-chart"" tabindex=""1""&gt;Edit Chart&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;


I've also considered jQuery, but that has similar limitations to the CSS route, plus I refust to believe that I am the only one that has ever wished to do this - there must be a way, I just can't find it!

Any hints and tips appriciated.

Thanks.
","Use a submenu page as parent slug. The admin menu has just two levels, so the imaginary third level will be hidden.

Sample code, tested:

add_action( 'admin_menu', 'wpse_73622_register_hidden_page' );

function wpse_73622_register_hidden_page()
{
    add_submenu_page(
        'options-writing.php',
        'Hidden!',
        'Hidden!',
        'exists',
        'wpse_73622',
        'wpse_73622_render_hidden_page'
    );
    # /wp-admin/admin.php?page=wpse_73622
}

function wpse_73622_render_hidden_page()
{
    echo '&lt;p&gt;hello world&lt;/p&gt;';
}

482,482,750,Power loss from an inductive load,"A problem reads ""A single phase 50 Hz generator supplies an inductive load of 5000 kW at a power factor of 0.707 lagging ... ""
How can there be real power loss from an inductor? 
",Let It Be,https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/10245,"With a 5 GigaWatt generation of power, caused by heavy industry with motor driven inductive loads it raises the reactive current which doesn't get counted as ""real"" power consumption but is a cost to the provider, as it reduces the capacity limited by current in distribution losses. Motors have inductance but do work (consume real power) and have losses and dissipate heat from many causes, such as winding resistance.

To resolve this, switchable capacitor banks are manually or automatically adjusted near the sub-stations to raise the power factor and reduce the peak current back to the source. They select +VARS of phase leading current from banks to offset some of the -VARS from the loads to reduce distribution losses and improve capacity for real power to be sold.

So even though as consumers we are measured by real power, with all our fridge and air condition motors running, power providers need to raise the power factor when additional capacity is required or to reduce the distribution losses which can be as much as 10% in cable resistive loss. But in large hydro power stations this is still the most efficient power source.




the above answer was intended to offer a bigger picture of what power factor means to a 5GW power station. We obviously are not dealing with just inductors here but in general ""inductive loads"". Inductive Power factor is different from power Factor caused the growing issues of SMPS effects of current pulses before peak voltage. Olin has already clearly stated the theory &amp; fundamentals already. So maybe this should just be a side comment to put it in perspective on a large scale power network. I was not trying to compete with a better answer, just add practical value.

$$\sum\limits_{n=-\infty}^{+\infty} f(n) = \sum\limits_{n=-\infty}^{+\infty}\int\limits_{-\infty}^{+\infty} f(x)e^{2\pi nix}dx$$

$$\int\limits_{-\infty}^{+\infty} \frac{e^{2\pi nix}dx}{x^2+r^2} = \frac{\pi}{r}e^{-2\pi|n|r}$$
(this integral can be taken by residue).
Therefore,
$$\sum\limits_{n=-\infty}^{+\infty} f(n)= \sum\limits_{n=-\infty}^{+\infty}\frac{1}{n^2+r^2}= \frac{1}{r^2}+2\sum\limits_{n=1}^{+\infty}\frac{1}{n^2+r^2} = \sum\limits_{n=-\infty}^{+\infty}\frac{\pi}{r}e^{-2\pi|n|r}=\frac{\pi}{r}+\frac{2\pi}{r}\frac{e^{-2\pi r}}{1-e^{-2\pi r}}.$$

I prefer a Calabi's method.
$$\frac{1}{(n+r)^2}=\int\limits_0^1\int\limits_0^1 (xy)^{n+r-1}dxdy.$$
Then

1328,1328,2093,What does it mean to interpret the Bible literally?,"Here are some common definitions from a dictionary for ‘literal’:


Being in accordance with, conforming to, or upholding the exact or primary meaning of a word or words.
Word for word; verbatim: a literal translation.
Avoiding exaggeration, metaphor, or embellishment; factual; prosaic: a literal description; a literal mind.


So what does it mean then to ‘take the Bible literally?’ Which definition are we referring to when we say ‘I take the Bible literally?’
",Mike,https://christianity.stackexchange.com/users/1743,"The easiest example is that of Creation, the very first part of the Bible presented as historical fact. Some believe that the Creation story is more of a myth or legend, and never really happened. Some, on the other hand, will say that the word ""days"" used there doesn't mean ""days"", but rather refers to spans of thousands or millions of years, during which time the earth was actually evolving, not being created as the Bible says.

A literal interpreter, on the other hand, will take the story at face value, believing that in seven days (that is, periods of 24 hours), God made the earth and all that is in it. They won't believe that he used some sped-up evolution.  They will interpret ""created"" to mean that out of nothing, God made something just by speaking it in to being. That is a literal interpretation.

That is just one example. There are many stories and historical events mentioned throughout the Bible that can be interpreted as being allegories or myths or legends, not fact. A literal interpreter, however, will always take the words of the Bible at face value.

I have a client who is unhappy with their current hosting situation. They want me to move their website and domain across to my hosting platform. I can do this.

However I have realised that the company has:

2) An SMTP Relay

Another company supplies my client with an SMTP relay. I've only really just found out what this is. I understand that emails are sometimes undelivered to the client and a mail relay routes incoming mails through another (more reliable?) server in order to keep trying to resend emails so none are missed.

Can an SVM give me estimates between 1 and 0? Is this behavior typical of an SVM or is it just the implementation I'm using.

Follow up question: Is the Maximum Entropy classifier generally just as good as an SVM when it comes to text?
",Blight,https://stats.stackexchange.com/users/67103,"Just to add to what @Barmaley.exe said (+1), if you want probabilities, then use an algorithm that was designed for that purpose, such as the Relevance Vector Machine, Gaussian Process classifier or Kernel Logistic Regression (I like KLR and use it a lot, e.g. here which gives some benchmark results compared to SVM and Gaussian process classification etc.).  Platt scaling will give probability estimates, but they are not likely to be as good as those from a model designed to give a probabilistic output.

One of the ideas behind the SVM is that it is better to solve the problem directly, rather than solving a more general problem and simplifying the answer.  For instance if you are only interested in discrete yes/no classification, then it is better to try and infer the decision boundary directly, rather than estimate the posterior probability of class membership (a more general problem) and then threshold at 0.5 (the simplification step).  The reason for this is that model resources are not allocated to improve the performance of the model away from the decision boundary and the problem of estimating the parameters is simplified, and less data are likely to be required.  The SVM then is likely to do a good job of estimating the decision boundary (or p = 0.5 contour of the probability), but the raw output of the SVM will not necessarily be a good basis for estimating the probability away from the decision boundary.

Follow up question: Is the Maximum Entropy classifier generally just as good as an SVM when it comes to text?
","Just to add to what @Barmaley.exe said (+1), if you want probabilities, then use an algorithm that was designed for that purpose, such as the Relevance Vector Machine, Gaussian Process classifier or Kernel Logistic Regression (I like KLR and use it a lot, e.g. here which gives some benchmark results compared to SVM and Gaussian process classification etc.).  Platt scaling will give probability estimates, but they are not likely to be as good as those from a model designed to give a probabilistic output.

One of the ideas behind the SVM is that it is better to solve the problem directly, rather than solving a more general problem and simplifying the answer.  For instance if you are only interested in discrete yes/no classification, then it is better to try and infer the decision boundary directly, rather than estimate the posterior probability of class membership (a more general problem) and then threshold at 0.5 (the simplification step).  The reason for this is that model resources are not allocated to improve the performance of the model away from the decision boundary and the problem of estimating the parameters is simplified, and less data are likely to be required.  The SVM then is likely to do a good job of estimating the decision boundary (or p = 0.5 contour of the probability), but the raw output of the SVM will not necessarily be a good basis for estimating the probability away from the decision boundary.

The best method of classification is probably cladistics which is based on the evolutionary history of organisms - but even it has problems when you start considering what to do with horizontal gene transfer and endosymbiosis. Because under a cladistic view, plants and animals are defined not by their features but by their ancestors your question becomes moot, I think.

2202,2202,3509,How to set the ID3 Year on an mp3?,"I'm creating my own MP3s with an online service, and I'm setting the ""Year"" attribute in the ID3v tag, but I'm having trouble getting it to work with both Nautilis and Rhythmbox. In Nautilis, when I click on ""Properties"" and select the ""Audio"" tab, it shows ""Year: Unknown"". In Rhythmbox, it does the same when selecting the file ""Properties"" and says it's ""Unknown"". When I use EasyTag though, it works fine and shows the Year field set properly. I've also tried using eyeD3 to try both ID3 v1.x, v2.3 and v2.4, but they all show ""Unknown"".

One other observation was when I changed the year from ""Unknown"" to ""2013"" in Rhythmbox, and then closed Rhythmbox, Nautilis still showed ""Unknown"" for the year.

Is there something more to setting the Year field on ID3 tags that I'm missing, or is this just some subtlety between how different programs interpret the tags?

You can also use a public reference for your object and drag it by using the Unity inspector.

2216,2216,3530,Can the socket in my recessed light be replaced without replacing the entire framing kit?,"I have recessed lighting in my living room.  One of the bulbs went out.  I tried replacing it with a fresh one, but no luck.  There is electricity flowing to the socket, but the socket appears to have gone bad.

I bought a replacement socket at Home Depot, but upon disassembling the light, I realized that I might not be able to replace the socket alone.

SOLVED: See Dan's answer below. I don't know how I missed it, but inside the socket there are screws.  The socket is not riveted to the enclosure.

2465,2465,3932,How can I put page through printer without cartridge?,"It might sound like a strange question, but I noticed that my printer is folding paper. So I would like diagnose it, whether it's because of cartridge or the problem is somewhere else.

If I could put paper through printer without cartridge inside, and it still would be folded then it would clearly be the problem with printer itself.

Printer is HP M125nw. Basically I would like to make sure, that folding is not because of cartridge.
",stil,https://superuser.com/users/335111,"looking at images of this printer, it doesn't look like there is a manual paper feed button.

Your best bet is to remove the cartridges one by one and do a print.  First remove black and do a print, then remove another and replace black and print again etc...  The printer may or may not allow this.

The alternative is to simply print a blank document.  If there is no need for the print head to be lowered, it won't crumple the paper.

It won't be down to the type of ink in the cartridge... it may give you poor print performance, but the ink won't jump out of the cartridge, screw up your page and then go back into the cartridge.  

It won't be the dimensions of the cartridge either - if it was too big, it wouldn't fit in the printer - or would at least smear ink across the page where it over-contacted if the cartridge was only too big by a mm or two..

I highly doubt that it is the cartridges that are chewing up your paper.  If I were you, I'd call them back and tell them you've tried original cartridges and it didn't work.

",Thijser,https://robotics.stackexchange.com/users/7226,"I experimented a bit and here's what I think happens.

When you run

$ rostopic echo /questions


The /questions topic doesn't exist before you run the program. Maybe you cheat it by first running your programming, running this command and then running your program again, but this assertion is still true. So at the point when you run your program, rostopic is not subscribed to any topic.

I don't know internally how this is handled by roscore and rostopic, but somewhere along the line, this is what's happening as the observed behavior of rostopic:

forever

    /* establish connection */
    while not subscribed to topic
        try to subscribe
        if failed
            sleep a bit

    /* intercept messages */
    while topic still exists
        wait for message
        print message


This means that rostopic (or more likely roscore on its behalf) waits for a topic to become available and subscribes to it.  It then proceeds to print incoming messages.  If the topic becomes unavailable, rostopic (or again more likely roscore on its behalf) goes back to waiting for the topic to become available again.

That said, here's what happens when this runs in parallel with your code:

    rostopic                       you

  wait for topic
      sleep







  wait for topic
      sleep

                                  start
                                ros::init
                             advertise topic
                          publish first message


subscribe to topic
 wait for message
      sleep


As you can see, your program publishes its first message immediately after advertising the topic. The unsuspecting rostopic program is not yet aware of this advertisement so is not actually subscribed to the topic yet. You publish the first message before rostopic gets a chance to subscribe to the topic.

You can verify this simply by putting a relatively large sleep after you advertise the topics and before you publish to them, i.e. between nc.init() and nc.spin().



To address your real problem (as stated and responded in the comments), which is to understand when the node has started up and use this as a trigger for further actions, I'd advise to consider another strategy.

Generally, you would want to make sure a node is up to make sure the other nodes that depend on it can run correctly. However, this doesn't mean that the original node has to be run just before the depending nodes. It could in theory be run long before them, or since ROS doesn't run in real-time and as you have observed, the timing between when topics are advertised, subscribed and the messages going around are quite unpredictable. Add network to this and they are really unpredictable.

So instead, you could devise a mechanism to query whether your node is available or not. This is simply done with a ROS service. You would essentially do all the necessary startup and then put up a service that always returns true. Any node that needs to ensure this node is available before proceeding can poll this service and as soon as a call to this service succeeds, you know the node is running.

As an added bonus, this means that you don't have to take this node down (and all depending nodes) just because you need to restart one of the depending nodes.

",Christian Werther,https://stackoverflow.com/users/786123,"It sounds like what you're talking about is a hash or lookup table, which Sass does not currently have. However, you can easily work around that in a variety of ways. Here are some examples.

You could structure your list a little differently:

$icons : (
  'arrow--down--full', '\e806', /* '' */
  'cog', '\e805', /* '' */
  'info', '\e807', /* '' */
  ...
);


I've added a comma after each item. Now to look it up you'd write a function like

@function lookup($list, $key) {
  @return nth( $list, ( ( index($list, $key) ) + 1) );
}


And call it like so

lookup($icons, 'cog'); // =&gt; '\e805'


You could push this a little further by making 2 different lists and then associating them via a similar function:

$icon-keys:    ('arrow--down--full', 'cog',    'info' ... );
$icon-values:  ('\e806',             '\e805',  '\e807' ... );


I've lined up the values with whitespace only to make them more legible to me so that they appear a bit like an actual table, but there are tons of ways of writing Sass lists, and you may prefer another. Then the function that associates them:

@function lookup($lookup-key, $all-keys, $all-values) {
  @return nth($all-values, index($all-keys, $lookup-key));
}


And using it:

lookup('cog', $icon-keys, $icon-values); // =&gt; '\e805'


For my tastes, these are both a bit clunky so I'd make a shortcut function to make it a bit more legible:

for the first variation:

@function icons($lookup-key) {
  @return lookup($icons, $lookup-key);
}


for the second:

@function icons($lookup-key, $types: $icon-keys, $values: $icon-values) {
  @return lookup($lookup-key, $types, $values);
}


so you could just in either case call

icons('cog');


You'd probably want to put a little more logic in your lookup functions to error catch, and you could also expand it to both accept and return a list rather than a single value, but this is just a basic example.

  'cog', '\e805', /* '' */
  'info', '\e807', /* '' */
  ...
);


I've added a comma after each item. Now to look it up you'd write a function like

@function lookup($list, $key) {
  @return nth( $list, ( ( index($list, $key) ) + 1) );
}


And call it like so

lookup($icons, 'cog'); // =&gt; '\e805'


You could push this a little further by making 2 different lists and then associating them via a similar function:

$icon-keys:    ('arrow--down--full', 'cog',    'info' ... );
$icon-values:  ('\e806',             '\e805',  '\e807' ... );


I've lined up the values with whitespace only to make them more legible to me so that they appear a bit like an actual table, but there are tons of ways of writing Sass lists, and you may prefer another. Then the function that associates them:

@function lookup($lookup-key, $all-keys, $all-values) {
  @return nth($all-values, index($all-keys, $lookup-key));
}


And using it:

lookup('cog', $icon-keys, $icon-values); // =&gt; '\e805'


For my tastes, these are both a bit clunky so I'd make a shortcut function to make it a bit more legible:

for the first variation:

@function icons($lookup-key) {
  @return lookup($icons, $lookup-key);
}


for the second:

@function icons($lookup-key, $types: $icon-keys, $values: $icon-values) {
  @return lookup($lookup-key, $types, $values);
}


so you could just in either case call

icons('cog');


You'd probably want to put a little more logic in your lookup functions to error catch, and you could also expand it to both accept and return a list rather than a single value, but this is just a basic example.

The 2011 Corvette Z06 Carbon edition stops from 60 mph in 93 feet and can accelerate to 123.6 mph over one-quarter mile in 11.6 seconds
The 2010 Porsche 911 GT3 needs 94 feet to stop from 60 mph, but needs 12.2 seconds to accelerate to 116.7 mph over one-quarter mile.

1x1 and 2x2 refer to the number of transmit and receive radio chains built into the Wi-Fi card. 2x2 means it has two transmit and two receive radio chains, and usually implies that it supports 2 ""spacial streams"", which is a key way that 802.11n is faster than the previous generation of Wi-Fi technologies. 802.11n is the first standard in the 802.11 family to support MIMO (pronounced ""MY-moh""), which stands for ""Multiple Inputs, Multiple Outputs"", which is basically a way of ganging together multiple radios to get faster data rates than you can get with a single radio on each end of the connection. Because it's possible to create a wireless card with 2 transmit and 2 receive radio chains but still not do real 2 spacial stream MIMO, some people in the industry now use the notation TxR:S, where T is the number of Transmit radio chains, R is the number of Receive radio chains, and S is the number of supported ""spacial streams"".

Because MIMO was the raison d'être for 802.11n, when the first N gear hit the market in 2007, it was all 2x2:2, which means it can support up to 300 megabit per second data rates when used with 40MHz-wide channels.

Unfortunately, within the last year or so, some companies have been being cheap, and, in my opinion, a bit deceptive, and selling 1x1:1 radios as 802.11n. Technically they do support a few of the slowest 802.11n-style modulation schemes, but since they only have a single transmit and receive radio, they aren't MIMO, and 802.11n without MIMO is like a BLT without bacon.

The maximum data rate a 1x1:1 radio can get is 150 megabits per second, and that's when using a 40MHz-wide channel (sometimes called simply a ""wide channel"", because before 802.11n, all standard 802.11 channels were never wider than about 20 or 22MHz).

Unfortunately, that 1x1 solution is only b/g/n and doesn't say ""a"", which implies it ONLY supports the small, congested 2.4GHz band.

The 2x2 solution says it supports ""a"" (802.11a), which only worked in the 5GHz band, which means that radio is 5GHz capable. Since it also lists b and g, you know it's 2.4GHz capable.

  Is there any way to obtain an entire range of IPs from a reverse-DNS?


Not really, no; in extremely rare cases you might be able to do a DNS zone transfer query to get all the records in the zone (the whole /24, generally), but there's a very low chance that the name server you're querying will respond to this request. Expect one query per address for reverse DNS (sorry!).


  Now, would it be safe to assume that all at least all IPs from 128.151.162.* will also resolve to rochester.edu?


Generally speaking, probably, as a university they're likely to own the whole /24.  However, that's not a good rule to apply as a general case; a smaller school might not have a whole /24, or might not have it in reverse DNS.



The reverse DNS itself is going to be pretty hit-or-miss - in many cases it'll be just generated names under the ISP's hostnames or no records at all.  For better data, we're going to make things even more expensive - you should also look at data from whois.

For example, here's the info from that Rochester IP - it shows the size of the allocation (the whole /16 range, so in this case that applies to 128.151.*.*) and the organization it's allocated to.

The whois info should provide a great source of truth for the info you want, and has the upside of being able to see what range that applies to.  The downside is that for smaller allocations, a range will often just show as belonging to the ISP instead of the end customer.  Combining both whois and reverse DNS should provide the best information (and be ridiculously slow).

I'm trying to perform reverse-DNS lookups to understand where traffic is coming from - e.g. what percentage of IPs resolve to corporations, schools, government, international etc.

Despite a bunch of optimizations, individually reverse-DNS'ing every IP address still appears to be fairly expensive though. So -

is there any way to obtain an entire range of IPs from a reverse-DNS?

If yes, this could greatly reduce the number of actual reverse-DNS lookups.

697,697,1102,The deceitful spirit sent by God,"
  1 Kings 22:19-28
  
  19 Micaiah continued, “Therefore hear the word of the Lord: I saw the Lord sitting on his throne with all the multitudes of heaven standing around him on his right and on his left. 20 And the Lord said, ‘Who will entice Ahab into attacking Ramoth Gilead and going to his death there?’
  
  “One suggested this, and another that. 21 Finally, a spirit came forward, stood before the Lord and said, ‘I will entice him.’
  
  22 “‘By what means?’ the Lord asked.
  
  “‘I will go out and be a deceiving spirit in the mouths of all his prophets,’ he said.
  
  “‘You will succeed in enticing him,’ said the Lord. ‘Go and do it.’
  
  23 “So now the Lord has put a deceiving spirit in the mouths of all these prophets of yours. The Lord has decreed disaster for you.”
  
  24 Then Zedekiah son of Kenaanah went up and slapped Micaiah in the face. “Which way did the spirit from[a] the Lord go when he went from me to speak to you?” he asked.
  
  25 Micaiah replied, “You will find out on the day you go to hide in an inner room.”
  
  26 The king of Israel then ordered, “Take Micaiah and send him back to Amon the ruler of the city and to Joash the king’s son 27 and say, ‘This is what the king says: Put this fellow in prison and give him nothing but bread and water until I return safely.’”
  
  28 Micaiah declared, “If you ever return safely, the Lord has not spoken through me.” Then he added, “Mark my words, all you people!”


So God sends a spirit enticing Ahab in order to attack Ramoth Gilead. If I may dare ask, why does God feel the need to send a deceiving spirit? Would this not go against the Commandments God has given? And why was such a spirit even within the close proximity in the presence of the Lord in the first place?

",acctman,https://codereview.stackexchange.com/users/13137,"I don't know about real quick. What you have doesn't really compliment a quick review. First off this is procedural code, which is fine if you are just getting started, don't let anyone tell you otherwise. But procedural code is not ""quickly"" read. I will suggest that once you have a firm grasp on the language, you should definitely take a look at OOP, but not before. You may notice me throwing this OOP (Object Oriented Programming) term around a lot. I tell a lot of people that I am against pushing OOP. No, not against OOP, just against pushing it. I won't tell you to stop what you are doing and learn OOP and no one else should either. Far from it. You need a solid understanding of the language first. Whenever I mention OOP I am merely pointing out that doing those suggestions now will prepare you for it and will make more sense as you progress into OOP. So take my OOP talk with a grain of salt, follow the suggestions, but don't go out and learn it just because I mentioned it. Now on to the review. I will read your code and write my thoughts as I have them, so you will be able to follow along in your own code. There is only one spot where I jump, but after that it should all be in order.

Review

The first problem I have with your code is that it is very redundant and inefficient. When you tell a program to die() or exit or go to a different header(), you are telling it to stop immediately, and, if applicable, process the argument between the parenthesis. Yet you have code after that and it will not process because you've already told it to stop. Rewrite your mysql_connect() like so:

$dbc = mysql_connect ($db_server, $db_user, $db_pass) or die(mysql_error());
// OR, if you want the header, remove the ""or die"" from above and use the following
if ( ! $dbc) { header ('Location: /contact'); }


You'll notice I did not use the mysql_error() in that second instance. That is because if you load the header it will send you to a different page and you will never see it. If you want to see it on the new page, I would suggest passing it as a GET parameter. Also, careful where you throw out those header()'s. Headers can not be called after information has already been sent to the browser. If possible, I would suggest setting up a function to hold all of the statements that set a new header so that it is all in one place.

Checking and Sanitizing POST

As mikeythemissile said, you should be checking your globals. And not just that they are set. You should be sanitizing them as well. If you have PHP version >= 5.2, check out filter_input(). NEVER trust user input. Always sanitize, scrub, and blast the hell out of it in any way that you can. It is better to be overly cautious than not at all, especially when dealing with SQL. Google SQL injection, its a real thing and can cause all sorts of problems for you.

Why are you checking if POST is an array? Of course it is, it should never not be an array. What you really want to check is if it is being used, which, if it isn't, would have thrown errors before this point. You should always check unreliable variables or arrays (GET, POST, etc...) before using them. So I would start by checking my POST like so.

if($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] == ""POST"") {//could also use isset($_POST)
    //here's an example of that filter_input method
    if(filter_input(INPUT_POST, 'contactsent', FILTER_VALIDATE_BOOLEAN) { header(Location: /contact'); }
    else {
        $new_array = array();//don't use the POST array after you have already gotten what you need from it, put it in a new array
        foreach($_POST as $key =&gt; $value) {
            $new_array[$key] = mysql_real_escape_string(stripslashes($value));
        }
    }
}


I would not crunch through POST blindly like that either. You've provided an array later in your script, $fields, that should serve as a list of items to check. This is where I jump, by the way. Loop over the $fields array to get the keys to search for in the POST array. First, I would change the way you get your $fields array. explode() is an ingenious way to get an array if the data you are trying to convert is dynamic and comes in that form already. However, you have manually typed these fields, so why bother with the extra processing power required to explode it? Just make it an array.

$fields = array(
    'RequestType',
    'ConsumerBusiness',
    'GlobalLocation',
    'FirstName',
    'LastName',
    'Email',
    'Title',
    'Company',
    'Address',
    'City',
    'State',
    'Zip',
    'Phone',
    'F', //What is this, make you variables clear and understandable all the rest are
    'ProductDesc',
    'Comment'
);


Now that you have this array, you can go back and do so many cool things with it. Such as getting only what you need from the POST array and ignoring everything else.

$new_array = array();
foreach($fields as $field) {
    $new_array[$field] = filter_input(INPUT_POST, $field, FILTER_SANITIZE_STRING | FILTER_SANITIZE_STRIPPED);//another example of filter_input
}


You can also use that same array to clean up your dbSet() function.

$set = '';
foreach($new_array as $field =&gt; $value) {
    $set .= ""`$field`='"" . mysql_real_escape_string($value) . ""', "";
}


Now, I'm not saying this code is 100%, this is just to give you ideas of how to use your code intelligently. Make your code work for you, don't work for your code. Expand upon this and you will see immediate improvement in your coding.

Repetitive Code

I really dislike this wall of variables. I would see about getting rid of it if you can. If possible try to make these changes while iterating over them with the $fields array or something. There is no reason for there to be this many copies of the same information. Also, why are you not using ucfirst()? That is obviously what you are trying to do with that strtoupper substring mess. Use the functions provided by PHP. In almost all cases they have a function to do what you want, so search for it before you reinvent it. The documentation is, pardon the repitition, well documented and easily navigable. I also would not convert a string to lowercase if not necessary, such as the email address.

$FirstName        = strtolower(str_replace(""'"",""''"",$_POST[""FirstName""]));//Not sure what you are doing here so I left it.
$FirstName        = ucfirst($FirstName);


Don't use repetitive if/else statements, use switch statements instead. They are proven faster and are cleaner, not to mention easily extendable.

switch($GlobalLocation) {
    case 'Canada':
        $SendTo=""canadainfo@------.com"";
    break;
    case 'Central America': 
        $SendTo=""customer.service@------.com.pa"";
    break;
    etc...

This function,dbSet(), just came out of no where. Because you are doing procedural code, you should make life easier on yourself and others who might eventually take over your code. Make it as easy to read as possible. The first step to this goal is placing your code logically. If you have custom functions, you should group them all together, preferably at the beginning of your program before you start your procedural code. Since you already know about require/include, I would suggest moving them to another file and requiring/including it at the very beginning. That's one of the first steps towards learning OOP, learning to separate your code, albeit in a not so OOP way, but still important...

Also, the dbSet() function is redundant. You already did mysql_real_escape_string() and stripslashes to the POST array in the foreach loop earlier. You will find that you repeat yourself a lot while writing procedural code. The best cure for this is to start breaking your procedural code up into functions. Functions are the first step to learning OOP.

Concatenating Variables

You are not concatenating your variables properly. To append data to the end of a variable use .=.  If you just use the concatenate operator . it will not change the variable, it will only add it to the local memory for that instance. In other words, if you were to echo it directly echo $Bodycopy . 'extrastuff'; you would get the desired results, but since you are doing multiple instances, you will need to append it first $Bodycopy .= 'extrastuff';. So change the way you concatenate all of your $Bodycopy variables to .=. Also, check out heredoc, or nowdoc for long strings such as these.

If Statements

Even if it is only one line. Please, for the love of god, use braces {}. I know it is not necessary. I know it knocks off 2 bits of file size per statement. I know a lot of people do it. But please, DON'T. It makes reading your code so much harder without those braces and doesn't harm anything to add them. I hate that PHP allows this and really wish they would remove it in future releases. It teaches bad coding habits.

More Repetition

The first two chunks under //mail server info is redundant. Remove all of those variables and just set them in the $headers array. Then, if you don't want to use the array reference ($headers['To']) you can use extract() to convert all of the array references to variables.

Exit

See comment, you can ignore this section...


   Lastly, stop using exit. Every single place you have used it, it is unnecessary. If you find yourself needing to stop your code like this, especially this frequently, you are doing something wrong. Mostly this extends from long procedural script and can be cured by OOP, but, in the mean time, if you just clean up your code and write it a bit more logically, you will notice that they are not necessary.

","I don't know about real quick. What you have doesn't really compliment a quick review. First off this is procedural code, which is fine if you are just getting started, don't let anyone tell you otherwise. But procedural code is not ""quickly"" read. I will suggest that once you have a firm grasp on the language, you should definitely take a look at OOP, but not before. You may notice me throwing this OOP (Object Oriented Programming) term around a lot. I tell a lot of people that I am against pushing OOP. No, not against OOP, just against pushing it. I won't tell you to stop what you are doing and learn OOP and no one else should either. Far from it. You need a solid understanding of the language first. Whenever I mention OOP I am merely pointing out that doing those suggestions now will prepare you for it and will make more sense as you progress into OOP. So take my OOP talk with a grain of salt, follow the suggestions, but don't go out and learn it just because I mentioned it. Now on to the review. I will read your code and write my thoughts as I have them, so you will be able to follow along in your own code. There is only one spot where I jump, but after that it should all be in order.

Review

The first problem I have with your code is that it is very redundant and inefficient. When you tell a program to die() or exit or go to a different header(), you are telling it to stop immediately, and, if applicable, process the argument between the parenthesis. Yet you have code after that and it will not process because you've already told it to stop. Rewrite your mysql_connect() like so:

$dbc = mysql_connect ($db_server, $db_user, $db_pass) or die(mysql_error());
// OR, if you want the header, remove the ""or die"" from above and use the following
if ( ! $dbc) { header ('Location: /contact'); }


You'll notice I did not use the mysql_error() in that second instance. That is because if you load the header it will send you to a different page and you will never see it. If you want to see it on the new page, I would suggest passing it as a GET parameter. Also, careful where you throw out those header()'s. Headers can not be called after information has already been sent to the browser. If possible, I would suggest setting up a function to hold all of the statements that set a new header so that it is all in one place.

Checking and Sanitizing POST

As mikeythemissile said, you should be checking your globals. And not just that they are set. You should be sanitizing them as well. If you have PHP version >= 5.2, check out filter_input(). NEVER trust user input. Always sanitize, scrub, and blast the hell out of it in any way that you can. It is better to be overly cautious than not at all, especially when dealing with SQL. Google SQL injection, its a real thing and can cause all sorts of problems for you.

Why are you checking if POST is an array? Of course it is, it should never not be an array. What you really want to check is if it is being used, which, if it isn't, would have thrown errors before this point. You should always check unreliable variables or arrays (GET, POST, etc...) before using them. So I would start by checking my POST like so.

if($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] == ""POST"") {//could also use isset($_POST)
    //here's an example of that filter_input method
    if(filter_input(INPUT_POST, 'contactsent', FILTER_VALIDATE_BOOLEAN) { header(Location: /contact'); }
    else {
        $new_array = array();//don't use the POST array after you have already gotten what you need from it, put it in a new array
        foreach($_POST as $key =&gt; $value) {
            $new_array[$key] = mysql_real_escape_string(stripslashes($value));
        }
    }
}


I would not crunch through POST blindly like that either. You've provided an array later in your script, $fields, that should serve as a list of items to check. This is where I jump, by the way. Loop over the $fields array to get the keys to search for in the POST array. First, I would change the way you get your $fields array. explode() is an ingenious way to get an array if the data you are trying to convert is dynamic and comes in that form already. However, you have manually typed these fields, so why bother with the extra processing power required to explode it? Just make it an array.

$fields = array(
    'RequestType',
    'ConsumerBusiness',
    'GlobalLocation',
    'FirstName',
    'LastName',
    'Email',
    'Title',
    'Company',
    'Address',
    'City',
    'State',
    'Zip',
    'Phone',
    'F', //What is this, make you variables clear and understandable all the rest are
    'ProductDesc',
    'Comment'
);


Now that you have this array, you can go back and do so many cool things with it. Such as getting only what you need from the POST array and ignoring everything else.

$new_array = array();
foreach($fields as $field) {
    $new_array[$field] = filter_input(INPUT_POST, $field, FILTER_SANITIZE_STRING | FILTER_SANITIZE_STRIPPED);//another example of filter_input
}


You can also use that same array to clean up your dbSet() function.

$set = '';
foreach($new_array as $field =&gt; $value) {
    $set .= ""`$field`='"" . mysql_real_escape_string($value) . ""', "";
}


Now, I'm not saying this code is 100%, this is just to give you ideas of how to use your code intelligently. Make your code work for you, don't work for your code. Expand upon this and you will see immediate improvement in your coding.

Repetitive Code

I really dislike this wall of variables. I would see about getting rid of it if you can. If possible try to make these changes while iterating over them with the $fields array or something. There is no reason for there to be this many copies of the same information. Also, why are you not using ucfirst()? That is obviously what you are trying to do with that strtoupper substring mess. Use the functions provided by PHP. In almost all cases they have a function to do what you want, so search for it before you reinvent it. The documentation is, pardon the repitition, well documented and easily navigable. I also would not convert a string to lowercase if not necessary, such as the email address.

$FirstName        = strtolower(str_replace(""'"",""''"",$_POST[""FirstName""]));//Not sure what you are doing here so I left it.
$FirstName        = ucfirst($FirstName);


Don't use repetitive if/else statements, use switch statements instead. They are proven faster and are cleaner, not to mention easily extendable.

switch($GlobalLocation) {
    case 'Canada':
        $SendTo=""canadainfo@------.com"";
    break;
    case 'Central America': 
        $SendTo=""customer.service@------.com.pa"";
    break;
    etc...
}

2671,2671,4256,"Why do airlines (typically?) require customers to phone for special meals, and not provide this option online?","When travelling on flights where meals are included, travellers who need special meals, such as vegetarian or kosher, are, in my experience, typically required to make such a request by phone.

For the traveller, this might mean a 15 minute hold, followed by a 1 minute phonecall.  After all, the operator simply needs to make an entry into a database somewhere.

Why don't airlines offer seem to offer travellers the option to select their special meal request through an online interface?  Or do I just have the bad luck to happen to fly with airlines where this request can only be made by phone?

Examples: Air Transat, Korean Air both require to contact the service centre by telephone.
",gerrit,https://travel.stackexchange.com/users/2509,"I am no definite expert on the topic but this customization of a flight, called ancillary services, are usually marketed to travel agents as a profit generator.

First let's clarify the different actors. The airlines offer and operate flights, the GDS (Global Distribution System) companies distribute the flights to travel agents and the latter sell to the traveller (you). The travel agents can be your local travel agent in his office, the online travel agent (OTA) like Expedia, Opodo or Kayak, or the airline itself through its website, phone service or offices.

In all cases the travel agent decides which ancillary service to sell to the customer. The travel agent probably pays to implement the service distribution (to the GDS) and receives a fee per transaction made. As meal selection is not generally a lucrative option - it is usually free of charge and I think religious or allergic people would react badly if they had to pay to get a specific meal - it is not worth offering for the travel agents. As @drat commented, the airlines have also little incentives (and higher logistic costs) to offer them. So it makes sense not to offer meal choice directly online. Note that some OTAs offer a free text field at the end of the booking without promising it will be read by anyone (I have seen that on govoyages, for example).

In the case of Emirates and Singapore Airlines, I have in mind that their image is based on open-mindedness, globalization and respect of the culture of the travellers. I insist on the fact that it is the image I have, you might not feel the same. But offering a choice of meal is a good marketing argument for a world-wide growing airline. On the opposite, Air Transat mostly targets Canadians visiting the Caribbean and transatlantic travellers, with less of a variety of travellers. Offering a large variety of meals would be more a burden than a marketing argument to them. And Air Transat offers ancillary services on their website like seat selection, so it is a deliberate choice not to offer meal selection.

In the end, I suppose that the reasons are economical. It costs less to offer less choice and not to prepare too many meals.

Ask customers to call for a special meal instead of offering it online?,"When travelling on flights where meals are included, travellers who need special meals, such as vegetarian or kosher, are, in my experience, typically required to make such a request by phone.

For the traveller, this might mean a 15 minute hold, followed by a 1 minute phonecall.  After all, the operator simply needs to make an entry into a database somewhere.

Why don't airlines offer seem to offer travellers the option to select their special meal request through an online interface?  Or do I just have the bad luck to happen to fly with airlines where this request can only be made by phone?

Examples: Air Transat, Korean Air both require to contact the service centre by telephone.
","I am no definite expert on the topic but this customization of a flight, called ancillary services, are usually marketed to travel agents as a profit generator.

First let's clarify the different actors. The airlines offer and operate flights, the GDS (Global Distribution System) companies distribute the flights to travel agents and the latter sell to the traveller (you). The travel agents can be your local travel agent in his office, the online travel agent (OTA) like Expedia, Opodo or Kayak, or the airline itself through its website, phone service or offices.

In all cases the travel agent decides which ancillary service to sell to the customer. The travel agent probably pays to implement the service distribution (to the GDS) and receives a fee per transaction made. As meal selection is not generally a lucrative option - it is usually free of charge and I think religious or allergic people would react badly if they had to pay to get a specific meal - it is not worth offering for the travel agents. As @drat commented, the airlines have also little incentives (and higher logistic costs) to offer them. So it makes sense not to offer meal choice directly online. Note that some OTAs offer a free text field at the end of the booking without promising it will be read by anyone (I have seen that on govoyages, for example).

In the case of Emirates and Singapore Airlines, I have in mind that their image is based on open-mindedness, globalization and respect of the culture of the travellers. I insist on the fact that it is the image I have, you might not feel the same. But offering a choice of meal is a good marketing argument for a world-wide growing airline. On the opposite, Air Transat mostly targets Canadians visiting the Caribbean and transatlantic travellers, with less of a variety of travellers. Offering a large variety of meals would be more a burden than a marketing argument to them. And Air Transat offers ancillary services on their website like seat selection, so it is a deliberate choice not to offer meal selection.

In the end, I suppose that the reasons are economical. It costs less to offer less choice and not to prepare too many meals. It depends on the travel agent you buy your tickets from, but there is no rule for who offers meal selection or does not. If it matters a lot, you can try to buy your ticket from another travel agent, it might work better.

906,906,1438,How does Charlie deduce Myra is Mrs Kieslowski?,"In Seven Psychopaths Charlie (Woody Harrelson) comes to the hospital to find Mrs Kieslowski. He finds a patient- who we know is Myra Kieslowski- but wrongly assumes that because she is black it cannot be her. He then tells her how he is looking for Mrs Kieslowski because her husband has stolen his dog.

In the course of the subsequent conversation, he comes to realise that she is the woman he's looking for. But I can't understand how.

Here's the discussion between Charlie and Moyra.


  Myra: I'm sure Mr. Kieslowski will take good care of your dog and get
  it back to you safe. He always seems like a sweet man when he comes
  in.
  
  Charlie: He come visit her a lot?
  
  Myra: Every day-
  
  Charlie: What kind of times every day?
  
  Myra: Different times, you know. And not every day. He misses a day
  now and then.
  
  Charlie: Oh. yeah? He been in today?
  
  Myra: Yeah. He came in earlier this morning, about 10:00 or so.
  
  Charlie: So the Polack married a n*gger, huh?


How did Charlie deduce this, from the conversation?

He finds a patient- who we know is Myra Kieslowski- but wrongly assumes that because she is black it cannot be her. He then tells her how he is looking for Mrs Kieslowski because her husband has stolen his dog.

In the course of the subsequent conversation, he comes to realise that she is the woman he's looking for. But I can't understand how.

Here's the discussion between Charlie and Moyra.


  Myra: I'm sure Mr. Kieslowski will take good care of your dog and get
  it back to you safe. He always seems like a sweet man when he comes
  in.
  
  Charlie: He come visit her a lot?
  
  Myra: Every day-
  
  Charlie: What kind of times every day?
  
  Myra: Different times, you know. And not every day. He misses a day
  now and then.
  
  Charlie: Oh. yeah? He been in today?
  
  Myra: Yeah. He came in earlier this morning, about 10:00 or so.
  
  Charlie: So the Polack married a n*gger, huh?


How did Charlie deduce this, from the conversation? 

Was it just the fact that Myra seemed too eager to convince him that Charlie had already missed Mr Kieslowski's visit and was wasting his time waiting? In which case, why did she say he visited every day?

249,249,402,Interacting with openCPU,"I've stumbled across an awesome open source project called openCPU.org and I'm tremendously excited about the project.  As a research scientist trying to create a website hosting my work, I would love nothing more than to be able to run R on the cloud to have my scripts run in real time and show up on my webpages.  So a big time thanks to Jeroen for making this project happen.

With that, onto my question.

How the heck do I interact with openCPU?

I can put an example function into ""run some code"" at:

http://public.opencpu.org/userapps/opencpu/opencpu.demo/runcode/

And retrieve a PNG image of my code, which is great!

But how do I do that in my own webpage, or via a URL?

I can get the object of my original code upload from this page, something like: ""x3ce3bf3e33""

If it is a function similar to:

myfun &lt;-function(){

x = seq(1,6.28)
y = cos(x)
p = plot(x,y)
print(p)
# also tried return(p)
}


Shouldn't I be able to call it via:

http://public.opencpu.org/R/tmp/x3ce3bf3e33/png

What about with input variables? e.g.:

myfun &lt;-function(foo){

x = seq(1,foo)
y = cos(x)
p = plot(x,y)
print(p)
}


I feel that perhaps there is something I am missing.  How do I specify ""GET"" or ""POST"" with the url?

EDIT

Ok in response to @Jeroen below, I need to use to use POST and GET with the API.  Now my question is extend to the following issue of getting PHP to interact with it correctly.  

Say I have the code:

&lt;?php

$foo = 'bar';
$options = array(
    'method' =&gt; 'POST',
    'foo' =&gt; $foo,
    );
$url = ""http://public.opencpu.org/R/tmp/x0188b9b9ce/save"";
$result = drupal_http_request($url,$options); // drupal function
?&gt;


How do I then access what is passed back in $result? I am looking to get a graph.  It looks like this:

{
    ""object"" : null,
    ""graphs"" : [
        ""x2acba9501a""
    ],
    ""files"" : {}
} 


The next step will be to GET the image, something along the lines of:

$newurl = ""http://public.opencpu.org/R/tmp/"".$result[""graph""].""/png"";
$image = drupal_http_request($newurl);
echo $image;


But I don't know how to access the individual elements of $result?

EDIT #2

Ok guys, I've gotten this to work, thanks to the answer below and to multiple other help sessions, and a lot of smashing my head against the monitor.

Here we go, done with cURL

&lt;?php

$ch = curl_init();
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_URL, 'http://public.opencpu.org/R/tmp/x0188b9b9ce/save');
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POST, 1); // Method is ""POST""
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, 1); // Returns the curl_exec string, rather than just Logical value
$result = curl_exec($ch);
curl_close($ch);
$new = json_decode($result,true); // $result is in 'json' format, decode it
$get = $new['graphs'][0]; // the 'hashkey for the image, ""x2acba9501a"" above

$img = 'http://public.opencpu.org/R/tmp/'.$get.'/png'; // link to the png image

echo &lt;&lt;&lt;END  // use this to display an image from the url
&lt;a href=""$img""&gt;
&lt;img src=""$img""&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
END

",Solar Nick,https://stackoverflow.com/users/1457857,"OpenCPU uses HTTP POST to execute functions, and HTTP GET to read/render objects and graphs. You could start with saving your function to the temporary store, and then calling it from there. A basic example is given in the ""/R/tmp API"" chapter of the interactive manual. If you click the red demo buttons named save a function, get the function and call the function it will work you through the steps. 

Basically in the first step you do a HTTP POST to the identity function to save your function in the store. This is also what is being done in the third form of the running code example page that you found. So I just copied your code there and then it returned me the object x0188b9b9ce.

To inspect if everything went OK, you can then read this object using HTTP GET. For example, open this url to read the source code of your function:

http://public.opencpu.org/R/tmp/x0188b9b9ce/ascii


Alternative outputs are for example to get the function as an RData file:

http://public.opencpu.org/R/tmp/x0188b9b9ce/rda


Important is that HTTP GET never executes functions. It just looks stuff up, and returns it in the output format that you requested. So now that you're convinced your function is there in the store we want to run it. To do this you need a HTTP POST again. For example to obtain a PDF, you can do

POST http://public.opencpu.org/R/tmp/x0188b9b9ce/pdf
POST http://public.opencpu.org/R/tmp/x0188b9b9ce/svg
POST http://public.opencpu.org/R/tmp/x0188b9b9ce/png


If the function you calling takes arguments, you include them as parameters to the HTTP POST request. When you want to include the output in your webpage, usually you only want to use HTTP POST in combination with the /save output type. So you would use jquery or whatever to do:

POST http://public.opencpu.org/R/tmp/x0188b9b9ce/save


Which might return something like this:

{
    ""object"" : null,
    ""graphs"" : [
        ""x2acba9501a""
    ],
    ""files"" : {}
}


This indicates that your function has been executed successfully, and it created a plot (yay!). The graphic was saved to the tmp store. So you can now obtain the graphic and embed it in your page using HTTP GET:

For example, is it possible to switch from a TD Drivers Rewards Visa card to a TD Platinum Travel Visa card? Or, if TD Bank doesn't allow this, would you generally expect banks to allow this sort of change?

Obviously, you cannot change from a visa card to a mastercard; this necessarily would involve changing the credit card number. Also, for the sake of this academic exercise, assume the person switching would qualify for the new card.
",ChrisInEdmonton,https://money.stackexchange.com/users/3983,"Every Card type comes with its set of reward and other features.

3532,3532,5630,What's the best method to responsibly dispose of used alkaline batteries?,"Years ago, I would have typically tossed typical, Alkaline batteries in the trash.  I have been reading more and more on this topic, and while I see that rechargeable batteries should be recycled, I'm finding conflicting evidence on how best to dispose of Alkaline batteries.

For example, Duracell claims that since they removed the mercury from batteries, they're safe for disposal.  But others claim (see Disqus comments at the bottom) that since all batteries contain various kinds of heavy heavy metals and should thus be recycled. 
",Jonathan Oliver,https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/28508,"It depends on what recycling and disposal services are available to you, and at what price.

No batteries are designed for eating, drinking, or growing plants from.  I'm certainly not surprised if there are elements newly found in them that are toxic, but it is a matter of the dose.  A waste stream concentrates the dose.

Mercury was present once upon a time, but it became such a problem that it was removed.  From all but mercury batteries.  ;-)

Rechargeable batteries such as NiCd ought to avoid ground disposal for reasons of the Cd, and the risk of it leaching into water table.  But ground disposal can be designed to reduce this risk.

Rechargeable batteries such as NiMH can probably be recycled for their nickel, but the economics will depend on the nickel price.

Rechargeable batteries such as lead acid ought to be recycled, as the lead fetches a good price.  The lead is also toxic at the right dose.

I've heard Lithium based batteries are interesting to some because of the Lithium.

1169,1169,1838,The Probability of Catching Criminals,"I have been struggling with the following question and would greatly appreciate any help  :)


  Suppose we have information about the supermarket purchases of 100 million people. Each person goes to the supermarket 100 times in a year and buys 10 of the 1000 items that the supermarket sells. We believe that a pair of criminals will buy exactly the same set of 10 items at some time during the year. If we search for pairs of people who have bought the same set of items, would we expect that any such people found were truly criminals? Assume our hypothesis to be that a pair of criminals will surely buy a set of 10 items in common at some time during the year. 


This is meant to be an illustration of Bonferroni's principle. Suppose there are no criminals and that everyone behaves at random. Would we find any pairs of people who appear to be criminals?

We must initially find the expected number of pairs who buy the same 10 items per year. I'm not sure whether I do this correctly...

Here is how I've been going about solving it:

Number of possible pairs of people: $\binom{10^6}{2} = \frac{10^{12}}{2} = 5 \times 10^{11}$, using the fact that $\binom{n}{2} \approx \frac{n^2}{2}$, when $n$ is large.

Number of possible 10-item selections: $\binom{10^3}{10} \approx 2.6 \times 10^{23}$

Probability of a customer buying 10 particular items at a point in time:
$\frac{1}{2.6 \times 10^{23}}$

Probability of a customer buying 10 particular items at least once over the course of 100 periods in time: $\frac{100}{2.6 \times 10^{23}}$

Probability of a pair buying exactly the same 10 items (both at least once) over the course of 100 periods in time: $(\frac{100}{2.6 \times 10^{23}})^2 = (\frac{1}{2.6 \times 10^{21}})^2 = \frac{1}{6.76 \times 10^{42}}$

The expected number of pairs who buy the same 10 items per year is thus:

$ 5 \times 10^{11} \times \frac{1}{6.76 \times 10^{42}} = \frac{5}{6.75 \times 10^{31}}$

Because the above number is so low if we do find a pair buying the same 10 items then, under our hypothesis, they are likely to be criminals and not a false positive case. 

I am just wondering whether my solution to the above is correct?
",user1200428,https://math.stackexchange.com/users/72187,"My understanding of the problem is as follows:
Person A has 100 sets of 10 items because he went to the store 100 times in the year. Now the probability that B goes to the store and buys a set that was also bought by A is 
$$
100*\frac{1}{1000\choose 10}
$$

This was for B's one visit. The 100 that we see in the product comes from the fact that A had 100 items. Now we know B also went to the store 100 times so probability that A and B had a same set of 10 items becomes 
$$
100*\frac{1}{1000\choose 10}*100
$$

Knowing that we have 100 million people, possible pairs of A and B 
$$
{10^8\choose 2}
$$
Hence the final answer to me seems to be 
$$
100*\frac{1}{1000\choose 10}*100*{10^8\choose 2} \sim \frac{10^{20}}{10^{30}}*10\,!

  Suppose we have information about the supermarket purchases of 100 million people. Each person goes to the supermarket 100 times in a year and buys 10 of the 1000 items that the supermarket sells. We believe that a pair of criminals will buy exactly the same set of 10 items at some time during the year. If we search for pairs of people who have bought the same set of items, would we expect that any such people found were truly criminals? Assume our hypothesis to be that a pair of criminals will surely buy a set of 10 items in common at some time during the year. 


This is meant to be an illustration of Bonferroni's principle. Suppose there are no criminals and that everyone behaves at random. Would we find any pairs of people who appear to be criminals?

We must initially find the expected number of pairs who buy the same 10 items per year. I'm not sure whether I do this correctly...

Here is how I've been going about solving it:

Number of possible pairs of people: $\binom{10^6}{2} = \frac{10^{12}}{2} = 5 \times 10^{11}$, using the fact that $\binom{n}{2} \approx \frac{n^2}{2}$, when $n$ is large.

Number of possible 10-item selections: $\binom{10^3}{10} \approx 2.6 \times 10^{23}$

Probability of a customer buying 10 particular items at a point in time:
$\frac{1}{2.6 \times 10^{23}}$

Probability of a customer buying 10 particular items at least once over the course of 100 periods in time: $\frac{100}{2.6 \times 10^{23}}$

Probability of a pair buying exactly the same 10 items (both at least once) over the course of 100 periods in time: $(\frac{100}{2.6 \times 10^{23}})^2 = (\frac{1}{2.6 \times 10^{21}})^2 = \frac{1}{6.76 \times 10^{42}}$

The expected number of pairs who buy the same 10 items per year is thus:

$ 5 \times 10^{11} \times \frac{1}{6.76 \times 10^{42}} = \frac{5}{6.75 \times 10^{31}}$

Because the above number is so low if we do find a pair buying the same 10 items then, under our hypothesis, they are likely to be criminals and not a false positive case. 

I am just wondering whether my solution to the above is correct?
","My understanding of the problem is as follows:
Person A has 100 sets of 10 items because he went to the store 100 times in the year. Now the probability that B goes to the store and buys a set that was also bought by A is 
$$
100*\frac{1}{1000\choose 10}
$$

This was for B's one visit. The 100 that we see in the product comes from the fact that A had 100 items. Now we know B also went to the store 100 times so probability that A and B had a same set of 10 items becomes 
$$
100*\frac{1}{1000\choose 10}*100
$$

Knowing that we have 100 million people, possible pairs of A and B 
$$
{10^8\choose 2}
$$
Hence the final answer to me seems to be 
$$
100*\frac{1}{1000\choose 10}*100*{10^8\choose 2} \sim \frac{10^{20}}{10^{30}}*10\,!
$$

Markup authors can specify the language for source code, but not markdown authors.

If so, might the following work


If the first line is ""#!"" followed by one or more word characters, then make the first line invisible (using CSS hidden:visible) and use those word characters as the file extension.
Otherwise, use the current scheme.

3616,3616,5774,Should I have one unified design between mobile and desktop?,"With a website I'm building, I'm wondering if I should combine the experiences between platforms together. For example, I'm wondering if I should keep this for both mobile and desktop. Here are some examples




I'm mainly wondering about the header. Is it bad to keep a more mobile like design (meaning slide menus, e.t.c.) on desktop, or should I utilize more of the space that mobile would not have?
",Tinfoilboy,https://ux.stackexchange.com/users/47826,"First off all, I appreciate that you seem to design your responsive web with a mobile-first approach (that's how I perceive it anyway).

As Imperative has already stated, consistency is generally a good thing. However, the mobile-sized interface might still be come through as consistent with the desktop-sized ditto even though they don't share the exact same navigation pattern. For instance branding elements, graphical profile, copy, artwork and information architecture might keep it together just fine. Especially important is that the IA is, at least, very similar for the users to find their way around the site. When the content is grouped and structured the same way, a user that is familiar with one of the platforms but new to the second will know what to look for and have a hunch of how too, which helps a lot. 

The off-canvas drawer menu is (obviously) a solution that partially solves a common mobile interface problem: the deficit of real estate. But that's a problem that rarely applies when it comes to desktop interfaces. Consistency is valuable, but should you be consistent between your own interfaces, or with the standards for the respective platforms they're being used in?

Off-canvas drawer for mobile:  


Access to all top level navigation items in one place 
Robust in a sense that new items can be added in infinity (can be a curse too:)
Menu button is in a convenient position (even though it's usually in the ""hard"" corner)


Off-canvas for desktop: 


I guess Fitt's law still applies, and the expedition up the north-western corner of the screen can actually be quite long. A drop in efficiency?
You don't always want to fill the entire width with content as the user can use a very wide screen on a PC, which can make the positioning of the menu and its button really awkward, and actually even hard to see. 
A button in the corner can interfere with hot corners, or rather, the other way around. 
An extra click, that could have been avoided, is added to reach a menu item.

For example, I'm wondering if I should keep this for both mobile and desktop. Here are some examples




I'm mainly wondering about the header. Is it bad to keep a more mobile like design (meaning slide menus, e.t.c.) on desktop, or should I utilize more of the space that mobile would not have?
","First off all, I appreciate that you seem to design your responsive web with a mobile-first approach (that's how I perceive it anyway).

As Imperative has already stated, consistency is generally a good thing. However, the mobile-sized interface might still be come through as consistent with the desktop-sized ditto even though they don't share the exact same navigation pattern. For instance branding elements, graphical profile, copy, artwork and information architecture might keep it together just fine. Especially important is that the IA is, at least, very similar for the users to find their way around the site. When the content is grouped and structured the same way, a user that is familiar with one of the platforms but new to the second will know what to look for and have a hunch of how too, which helps a lot. 

The off-canvas drawer menu is (obviously) a solution that partially solves a common mobile interface problem: the deficit of real estate. But that's a problem that rarely applies when it comes to desktop interfaces. Consistency is valuable, but should you be consistent between your own interfaces, or with the standards for the respective platforms they're being used in?

Off-canvas drawer for mobile:  


Access to all top level navigation items in one place 
Robust in a sense that new items can be added in infinity (can be a curse too:)
Menu button is in a convenient position (even though it's usually in the ""hard"" corner)


Off-canvas for desktop: 


I guess Fitt's law still applies, and the expedition up the north-western corner of the screen can actually be quite long. A drop in efficiency?
You don't always want to fill the entire width with content as the user can use a very wide screen on a PC, which can make the positioning of the menu and its button really awkward, and actually even hard to see. 
A button in the corner can interfere with hot corners, or rather, the other way around. 
An extra click, that could have been avoided, is added to reach a menu item.
The menu items are obscured until the user has visited the menu, when they could have been displayed directly. 


Based on the arguments above, I would recommend a different pattern than the drawer menu for the desktop site.

How do I know if which leg is the emitter or the collector in a Transistor (For both PNP and NPN) using only an analog multimeter?
",Raven,https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/6910,"Set meter to lowish ohms range so a diode conduction can be seen - trial and error OR diode test if available.


With an NPN transistor the base will have two diodes facing away from it. ie with most positive meter lead on the base the other two leads will show a conducting diode when the negative lead is placed on them
With a PNP  transistor the base will have two diodes facing towards it. ie with most positive negative (usually black) meter lead on the base the other two leads wil show a conducting diode when the positive  lead is placed on them


OK - now you know NPN from PNP and which is base. Now


Connect positive to guessed collector for NPN and negative to guessed emitter. Set meter to 1 megohm plus range.

-Connect base to guessed collector via a high value resistor - probably 100k to 1M. A wet finger works well. Note reading.


Now swap guessed emitter and collector and repeat. Again resistor is added from base to guessed collector. Note reading



One of the two above will have a much lower R_CE reading when base is forward biased. That's the correct guess. 

Once you get used to this you can pick up a leaded transistor, juggle it with meter leads till you find the two diodes giving base and NPN or PNP then lick your finger and do a forward bias base test - and then declare pinout. Looks like magic to many. Works.

You can or course formalize that on a breadboard and even add (gasp) switches to swap polarity etc.

One thing that makes this conversion a little bit tricky, is the existence of a breaker box at the rear corner of the room.

As you can see in the image below, we plan to have the back 5' of the room become a storage area (there would be 2' deep shelving units along the back wall, stopping short of the breaker box, we would use this area to store Christmas decorations, misc. stuff, etc..).  I know it is illegal to place a breaker box in a closet that will store clothes or other combustibles.  So my questions would be: 1) how would one define a storage room vs. a closet (i.e.- could this be classified as a walk in closet somehow?) and 2) with > 36"" clearance in front, and 30"" around, would this be legal?


",MarkD,https://diy.stackexchange.com/users/346,"National Electrical Code (NEC) typically defines rooms and areas based on the ""intended"" use of the area. They do not provide a definition for a ""storage room"", but they do provide a definition for a ""clothes closet"".


  Clothes Closet. A non-habitable room or space intended primarily for storage of garments and apparel.


To answer the rest of your question, we'll have to take a look at Article 110.  Since section 110.26 of the NEC is a bit long, quoting the entire text here may not be considered ""fair use"" so instead I'll summarize it for you.


  National Electrical Code 2008
  
  ARTICLE 110 Requirements for Electrical Installations
  
  II. 600 Volts, Nominal, or Less
  
  110.26 Spaces About Electrical Equipment. Sufficient access and working space shall be provided and maintained about all electrical
  equipment to permit ready and safe operation and maintenance of such
  equipment.


110.26(A)(1) Depth of Working Space.
This section says the depth of Working Space must be between 3 and 4 feet, ""measured from the exposed live parts or from the enclosure or opening if the live parts are enclosed"".  In a typical residential situation, the depth of Working Space will be 3'.

110.26(A)(2) Width of Working Space.
This section says the width of Working Space must be the width of the equipment or 30"", whichever is greater. And that there should be enough Working Space to allow the equipment door to open 90 degrees.

110.26(A)(3) Height of Working Space.
The Working Space must be clear from ""the grade, floor, or platform"" to the height of 6 1/2', or the height of the equipment whichever is greater. There is an exception to this which says:


  In existing dwelling units, service equipment or panelboards that do not exceed 200 amperes shall be permitted in spaces where the headroom
  is less than 2.0 m (61⁄2 ft).


This section also says that any other equipment associated with the electrical installation""located above or below the equipment, cannot extend more than 6"" beyond the front of the equipment.


  110.26(B) Clear Spaces. Working space required by this section shall not be used for storage. When normally enclosed live parts are
  exposed for inspection or servicing, the working space, if in a

110.26(D) Illumination.
This is a section that is often overlooked in residential situations, and is often satisfied simply by having lights in the room where the service panel is installed.  Personally, I take this section seriously.  I recommend installing a dedicated circuit, consisting of a single switch and a single luminaire. Then installing it just above the equipment, as to provide adequate light for anybody working on the equipment.  Putting the luminaire on a dedicated circuit allows you to deenergize other circuits, while maintaining good lighting while servicing the equipment.

It's a good idea (though a bit overkill), to also provide emergency lighting near the equipment.  Installing a simple fixture like this near the equipment, ensures that you won't have to fumble in the dark to flip breakers if the power ever goes out.



This unit can be installed on the same dedicated equipment luminaire circuit. That way even if you have to switch off the whole panel to do work, you'll still have light.



tl;dr


Keep an area 30"" wide, 36"" deep, and 6 1/2' high in front of the equipment clear (Working Space).
Provide ""sufficient area"" for entrance to and egress from the equipment (see local building codes to determine ""sufficient area"").
Make sure the area has enough lighting.

One thing that makes this conversion a little bit tricky, is the existence of a breaker box at the rear corner of the room.

As you can see in the image below, we plan to have the back 5' of the room become a storage area (there would be 2' deep shelving units along the back wall, stopping short of the breaker box, we would use this area to store Christmas decorations, misc. stuff, etc..).  I know it is illegal to place a breaker box in a closet that will store clothes or other combustibles.  So my questions would be: 1) how would one define a storage room vs. a closet (i.e.- could this be classified as a walk in closet somehow?) and 2) with > 36"" clearance in front, and 30"" around, would this be legal?


","National Electrical Code (NEC) typically defines rooms and areas based on the ""intended"" use of the area. They do not provide a definition for a ""storage room"", but they do provide a definition for a ""clothes closet"".


  Clothes Closet. A non-habitable room or space intended primarily for storage of garments and apparel.


To answer the rest of your question, we'll have to take a look at Article 110.  Since section 110.26 of the NEC is a bit long, quoting the entire text here may not be considered ""fair use"" so instead I'll summarize it for you.


  National Electrical Code 2008
  
  ARTICLE 110 Requirements for Electrical Installations
  
  II. 600 Volts, Nominal, or Less
  
  110.26 Spaces About Electrical Equipment. Sufficient access and working space shall be provided and maintained about all electrical
  equipment to permit ready and safe operation and maintenance of such
  equipment.


110.26(A)(1) Depth of Working Space.
This section says the depth of Working Space must be between 3 and 4 feet, ""measured from the exposed live parts or from the enclosure or opening if the live parts are enclosed"".  In a typical residential situation, the depth of Working Space will be 3'.

110.26(A)(2) Width of Working Space.
This section says the width of Working Space must be the width of the equipment or 30"", whichever is greater. And that there should be enough Working Space to allow the equipment door to open 90 degrees.

110.26(A)(3) Height of Working Space.
The Working Space must be clear from ""the grade, floor, or platform"" to the height of 6 1/2', or the height of the equipment whichever is greater. There is an exception to this which says:


  In existing dwelling units, service equipment or panelboards that do not exceed 200 amperes shall be permitted in spaces where the headroom
  is less than 2.0 m (61⁄2 ft).


This section also says that any other equipment associated with the electrical installation""located above or below the equipment, cannot extend more than 6"" beyond the front of the equipment.


  110.26(B) Clear Spaces. Working space required by this section shall not be used for storage. When normally enclosed live parts are
  exposed for inspection or servicing, the working space, if in a
  passageway or general open space, shall be suitably guarded.


Which means the equipment can be in an area used for storage, but the Working Space cannot be used for storage. The basic idea is if you draw a box on the floor in front of the equipment 30"" wide and 36"" deep, and then extend that box up 6 1/2', you'll have your ""Working Space"". As long as you keep this Working Space clear, you should have no problems.  However, there are a few more things to consider.

1962,1962,3126,"What's wrong with using ""Adoshem"" for the name of G-d when singing?","If seen it written that many chazzanim use ""Adoshem"" when singing (if not in the davening) as it has the same number of syllables as what they would be saying, namely Ado-noi, but that this is disrespectful, and they should just say ""Hashem"" instead.

Why is it disrespectful?  Does everyone agree with this?  What about using ""Amonai"" (""my Ammonites""?), as is done in the movie Ushpizin?  I understand why it was done there (had to sound close to the real thing), but I've since heard a choir use it too.
",Shalom,https://judaism.stackexchange.com/users/21,"The source for the statement that it's disrespectful is Taz, Orach Chaim 621:2 (and from there in Kitzur Shulchan Aruch 6:3). He writes:


  ועוד יש ללמוד מדברים הנזכרים כאן
  דבמקום שאין אנו רוצים להזכיר שם של
  אדנות י""ל השם, ולא כמ""ש המון עם אדושם,
  כי אין זה דרך כבוד של מעלה, אלא י""ל
  כלשון התנא השם


So it sounds like he's saying that the only acceptable substitute is ""Hashem,"" as found in the Mishnah (Yoma 3:8, 4:2, 6:2) and in the Yom Kippur Avodah. If I understand his reasoning correctly, the point is that the substitute word itself has to somehow express respect for the Divine Name, as ""Hashem"" does (since it means ""the Name [which we are not allowed to say in this context].""

Why is it disrespectful?  Does everyone agree with this?  What about using ""Amonai"" (""my Ammonites""?), as is done in the movie Ushpizin?  I understand why it was done there (had to sound close to the real thing), but I've since heard a choir use it too.
","The source for the statement that it's disrespectful is Taz, Orach Chaim 621:2 (and from there in Kitzur Shulchan Aruch 6:3). He writes:


  ועוד יש ללמוד מדברים הנזכרים כאן
  דבמקום שאין אנו רוצים להזכיר שם של
  אדנות י""ל השם, ולא כמ""ש המון עם אדושם,
  כי אין זה דרך כבוד של מעלה, אלא י""ל
  כלשון התנא השם


So it sounds like he's saying that the only acceptable substitute is ""Hashem,"" as found in the Mishnah (Yoma 3:8, 4:2, 6:2) and in the Yom Kippur Avodah. If I understand his reasoning correctly, the point is that the substitute word itself has to somehow express respect for the Divine Name, as ""Hashem"" does (since it means ""the Name [which we are not allowed to say in this context]."" By contrast, a word like ""Adoshem,"" while it avoids the problem of saying G-d's Name in vain, isn't a respectful substitute, since it has no meaning.

According to that, then, ""Amonai"" might also be problematic.

2332,2332,3716,The Probability of Catching Criminals,"I have been struggling with the following question and would greatly appreciate any help  :)


  Suppose we have information about the supermarket purchases of 100 million people. Each person goes to the supermarket 100 times in a year and buys 10 of the 1000 items that the supermarket sells. We believe that a pair of criminals will buy exactly the same set of 10 items at some time during the year. If we search for pairs of people who have bought the same set of items, would we expect that any such people found were truly criminals? Assume our hypothesis to be that a pair of criminals will surely buy a set of 10 items in common at some time during the year. 


This is meant to be an illustration of Bonferroni's principle. Suppose there are no criminals and that everyone behaves at random. Would we find any pairs of people who appear to be criminals?

We must initially find the expected number of pairs who buy the same 10 items per year. I'm not sure whether I do this correctly...

Here is how I've been going about solving it:

Number of possible pairs of people: $\binom{10^6}{2} = \frac{10^{12}}{2} = 5 \times 10^{11}$, using the fact that $\binom{n}{2} \approx \frac{n^2}{2}$, when $n$ is large.

Number of possible 10-item selections: $\binom{10^3}{10} \approx 2.6 \times 10^{23}$

Probability of a customer buying 10 particular items at a point in time:
$\frac{1}{2.6 \times 10^{23}}$

Probability of a customer buying 10 particular items at least once over the course of 100 periods in time: $\frac{100}{2.6 \times 10^{23}}$

Probability of a pair buying exactly the same 10 items (both at least once) over the course of 100 periods in time: $(\frac{100}{2.6 \times 10^{23}})^2 = (\frac{1}{2.6 \times 10^{21}})^2 = \frac{1}{6.76 \times 10^{42}}$

The expected number of pairs who buy the same 10 items per year is thus:

$ 5 \times 10^{11} \times \frac{1}{6.76 \times 10^{42}} = \frac{5}{6.75 \times 10^{31}}$

Because the above number is so low if we do find a pair buying the same 10 items then, under our hypothesis, they are likely to be criminals and not a false positive case. 

I am just wondering whether my solution to the above is correct?
",user1200428,https://math.stackexchange.com/users/72187,"If a person $A$ buys some (any) $10$ of the $1000$ items, then the probability that some other person $B$ buys the same set of $10$ items is 
$$\frac{1}{\binom{1000}{10}}.$$

For $N = 10^6$ people, and over $T = 100$ time units, the number of pairs of people is $T \binom{N}{2} = 100 \binom{10^6}{2}$.

So the expected number of occurrences of a pair of people buying the same set of items at the same time is
$$\frac{100 \binom{10^6}{2}}{\binom{1000}{10}} \approx \frac{100 \times 10^{12}/2}{2.6 \times 10^{23}} \approx \frac{2 \times 10^{13}}{10^{23}} \approx \frac{1}{5 \times 10^{9}},$$

What you are describing is done all the time by the US and non-US employees on their vacations/holidays. Technically while you are doing work in while being on US soil you are not working in the US since you're not being employed by a US employer and your travel to the US is not employment related, so apply for a tourist visa and you should be fine.

But I want to spend some time working for my employer (remote work) and getting paid by the employer. Is this possible under a tourist visa (B1/B2)?

I hope this is OK since I will not be getting paid by a US employer. I am in the IT trade so all that I will be needing is my own laptop and a connection to the internet. The money I earn would actually help me pay for the expenses I get during the holiday.
","Since so many people liked the comment I thought I'd turn it into an answer.

What you are describing is done all the time by the US and non-US employees on their vacations/holidays. Technically while you are doing work in while being on US soil you are not working in the US since you're not being employed by a US employer and your travel to the US is not employment related, so apply for a tourist visa and you should be fine.

To be more specific I found several sites explaining the differences between B1/B2 and H visas in more laymen's terms, so you can try to read up on that to make your determination:

964,964,1527,Applescript Delay not working since switch to Yosemite,"Ever since I upgraded to Yosemite, Applescripts that use delays have stopped working.  How can I fix this?

Here's the world's simplest Applescript, for the sake of an easy example:

set volume output volume 0
delay 5
set volume output volume 20

That should take 30 seconds to complete.  If I run it in Script Editor (formerly Applescript Editor) it takes 30 seconds to complete.  But if I save this script as an app, when I launch the app, the delays are ignored and the app takes a fraction of a second to complete.

How can I force Applescript to delay for a specified amount of time before moving on to the next step?  Is this a Yosemite glitch?  Is there a reliable workaround?
",2oh1,https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/50100,"@2oh1, you have the right basic idea in your answer, but here's a complete and correct answer:

The only reasonable way to work around this is to invoke ""delay"" within a loop that ensures the desired duration elapses before continuing. The best way to do this is to override ""delay"" with a custom handler:

on delay duration
  set endTime to (current date) + duration
  repeat while (current date) is less than endTime
    tell AppleScript to delay duration
  end repeat
end delay


This enables you to leave the rest of your script unchanged and you can use ""delay"" normally, e.g.,

delay 5
display alert ""I like cake!""


[NOTE: Normally, the custom handler would use ""continue delay duration"" to invoke the built-in ""delay"", but I found that, although this works within Script Editor, it returns an error when used within an applet (“Can’t continue delay.

  “‘I will go out and be a deceiving spirit in the mouths of all his prophets,’ he said.

  23 “So now the Lord has put a deceiving spirit in the mouths of all these prophets of yours. The Lord has decreed disaster for you.”

  25 Micaiah replied, “You will find out on the day you go to hide in an inner room.”

  28 Micaiah declared, “If you ever return safely, the Lord has not spoken through me.” Then he added, “Mark my words, all you people!”

For usability purposes, I would like to display different information on certain URLs in mobile than desktop. For example, I'd prefer the content to be straight on first page on mobile, whereas my desktop root domain is a landing page.


How will such arrangement affect Google's opinions about my site?
Is is hurtful for my rankings?
Or does Google separate desktop and mobile results?

",Kasperi,https://webmasters.stackexchange.com/users/41699,"It appears that you're worried that serving different content to mobile users than to desktop users at the same URL, using user-agent detection, might be considered a form of cloaking, and thus penalized by Google.

According to the Google Webmaster Central Blog, this is not the case, provided that you do the mobile browser detection properly.  Essentially, the important detail to realize is that Google's crawlers use different user-agent strings depending on whether they expect desktop or mobile content.  For example, a typical user-agent string for normal Googlebot requests would be:

Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; Googlebot/2.1; +http://www.google.com/bot.html)


whereas for requests from the mobile crawler, you'll see something like:

SAMSUNG-SGH-E250/1.0 Profile/MIDP-2.0 Configuration/CLDC-1.1
UP.Browser/6.2.3.3.c.1.101 (GUI) MMP/2.0 (compatible; Googlebot-Mobile/2.1;
+http://www.google.com/bot.html)

Googlebot/2.1; +http://www.google.com/bot.html)


As long as you make sure that you correctly detect the latter type of Googlebot requests (and not the former type) as mobile, and serve mobile content to them, everything should be fine.  Basically, the important thing is that normal Googlebot requests need to receive desktop content, while mobile Googlebot requests need to receive mobile content.

Here's a nice diagram illustrating this, from the Google Webmaster Central Blog article I linked to above:



Also, to let Google's crawler know that there might be different content available for mobile browsers, you'll want to configure your web server to send the Vary: User-Agent HTTP header for any pages that you're using user-agent detection for.  You'll also want to make sure to avoid common pitfalls when detecting user-agents.

6020,6020,9554,Do volcano blast changes earth's course?,"Volcano blasts are one of the most powerful calamities on earth. When they blast they release large amount of mass in the air just like a jet does. Does such a blast have any effect on the course of the Earth? Does it change the Earth's orbit in any way? If not then how big a blast is needed to do it? Would a full eruption of the Yellowstone Supervolcano do it?
",Dimensionless,https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/9023,"I do not think volcanic eruptions can change the course of the earth.

This is because whatever materials a volcano ejects ultimately land back to the ground, so the earth remains on its path. So no change in course/radius.

If, however, you can manage to create a blast which sends particles with such a force and such a speed that they never come back again (the speed will have to be $\geq 11.2 km/s$), then we can think about the change of course of the earth. Can Yellowstone do it?

But even if that DOES happen, the mass which it will be able to eject completely out of earth's gravitational field will be very less compared to the mass of the earth. So we can neglect and tiny change, since it's almost nothing. However, if a volcano could blast off even $1/10^{th}$s of the earth's mass, then we'd have some change in course/radius.



Addendum: I just thought of one thing though-
The material thrown up in a volcanic eruption emerges from inside the earth. When the eruption is over and the material is back on the ground, there has been a slight net displacement of the materials. What was first a few kilometres under the surface is now lying on the surface. Therefore, there may as well be a tiny change in course. 

HOWEVER, as pointed out before, the mass thrown up by a volcano is very very very less compared to the mass of the earth and the displacement of the material is very very less compared to the radius of the earth ($\approx 6400 km$), we can safely neglect this tiny change in course.
Even if there is a change, the radius of the earth's orbit around the sun is 150,000,000 km. A change in course by a fraction of a centimetre will make NO difference at all.



Addendum-2: Akash points out that the materials striking the ground don't apply the same force as the force at which the volcano erupts.   

That is not true. It may seem that the force is less, but that is because the materials are fragmented and a lot of the force is applied onto air too.
The force is distributed between all the particles and the air. When each particle strikes, it imparts its force to the earth. The air 'falls' back too, applying a force too. If you add up the forces, it will be equal to the force of the volcano.

698,698,1103,Opamp Voltage Doubler Unstable (After Extended Operation),"I've been working on a circuit which would drive an industry standard pneumatic regulator (E/P transducer).  The transducer takes a standard 0-10V command signal with a typical input impedance of 6.5 kOhms.  The DAC that I've selected (ADI 12bit 8 channel) has an internal 2.5V reference and can output 0-5V.  

After researching extensively, an opamp voltage doubler seemed like a good fit.  This worked and was rock solid for about two weeks, but failed after a ~2 day period of continuous operation without warning.  Now the opamp output is close to a correct 2.0 gain but constantly fluctuates as if the output is barely stable and poorly damped.  Has anyone ever seen an opamp fail this way?  

We're using a UA7812 linear regulator to supply 12V (from 24V) to the opamp quad (LM324AN) and admittedly it may not be sufficiently heatsinked (gets wicked hot to touch). Still, the 12V supply is solid at 11.83V and voltages supplied by the DAC appear correct and stable.  The actual resistors on the board are 10k with 0.1% accuracy and each measure 9.95k precisely.  Any advice in solving the problem is tremendously appreciated!  It's essential that this be a robust circuit.

Below is our final opamp configuration (and the part number):


",Liquid Plasmas,https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/68582,"I presume that your 12V is also supplying the E-P transducer power (and perhaps other stuff) and that's why the regulator is getting hot. You should heat sink it so that the case temperature is reasonable if you want reliable operation, or use a switching regulator. The exact numbers depend on your ambient range and desired reliability, but ""wicked hot"" sounds like it exceeds the 60-70°C range that I'd like to see for general purpose applications. 

The 'fluctuation' in op-amp output could be caused by oscillations. The LM324 is fairly robust with small capacitive loads (such as could be caused by cable to the transducer), especially for gain > 1, but you may still be having problems. I suggest this kind of output circuit: 







simulate this circuit &ndash; Schematic created using CircuitLab

The input filter R4/C2 keeps high frequencies out of the input and matches the impedances looking out of the op-amp inputs so as to minimize the effect of the relatively large bias current on the LM324. The resistor R1 isolates the capacitive loading on the output from the internal output impedance of the op-amp. C1 forms a tight loop for AC to stabilize the op-amp. The feedback (R2/R3) is taken directly from the output so that R1 does not affect the output voltage when sourcing current (note that when sinking current the op-amp cannot get close to the negative rail when sinking more than 50uA or so, so the 0V output can't be approached even without R1). In most cases, the input of your transducer looks like a resistor to 0V so it's not an issue.

D1 and D2 conduct any transients to the power supply, saving U1 from damage due to ESD. R4/C2 and D1/D2 are optional as far as your immediate problem goes, R1 and C1 do the work. I strongly suggest you get that regulator temperature under control as well.

2673,2673,4258,How does Charlie deduce Myra is Mrs Kieslowski?,"In Seven Psychopaths Charlie (Woody Harrelson) comes to the hospital to find Mrs Kieslowski. He finds a patient- who we know is Myra Kieslowski- but wrongly assumes that because she is black it cannot be her. He then tells her how he is looking for Mrs Kieslowski because her husband has stolen his dog.

In the course of the subsequent conversation, he comes to realise that she is the woman he's looking for. But I can't understand how.

Here's the discussion between Charlie and Moyra.


  Myra: I'm sure Mr. Kieslowski will take good care of your dog and get
  it back to you safe. He always seems like a sweet man when he comes
  in.
  
  Charlie: He come visit her a lot?
  
  Myra: Every day-
  
  Charlie: What kind of times every day?
  
  Myra: Different times, you know. And not every day. He misses a day
  now and then.
  
  Charlie: Oh. yeah? He been in today?
  
  Myra: Yeah. He came in earlier this morning, about 10:00 or so.
  
  Charlie: So the Polack married a n*gger, huh?


How did Charlie deduce this, from the conversation? 

Was it just the fact that Myra seemed too eager to convince him that Charlie had already missed Mr Kieslowski's visit and was wasting his time waiting? In which case, why did she say he visited every day? 
",Urbycoz,https://movies.stackexchange.com/users/4573,"The dialogue you cite actually comes after Myra sees Hans through her window and after she already talked a little bit with Charlie about Mrs Kieslowski. She was quite sure she could drag the whole situation out a bit, just playing her roommate and waiting what happens. But once she saw Hans walking to the hospital to visit her, she became increasingly nervous, knowing that Charlie was looking for him and the time ran short.

And nervous as she got, she suddenly brought the conversation to Mr. Kieslowski herself, which is where your quoted dialogue starts. And I think this is exactly the point where Charlie at least starts to get suspicious about her. I think this can be perceived in his behaviour, since after she said that, he suddenly starts to stop his little playing around with the wheelchair he sits in and turns around to look straight at her, getting nearer and nearer to her. And at this point he starts to interrogate her a bit more about Mr Kieslowski and his visiting times. Maybe he already guessed it at this point or he just had a suspicion. But it surely didn't help Myra that she got increasingly nervous and started beating around the bush with stuff like ""Different times, you know, not every day"" (after previously saying a pretty definite ""Every day"").

So to sum up, I would say at the point Myra brought the conversation to Mr Kieslowki (so at the start of your quoted dialogue section) Charlie definitely got suspicous about her and his supicion was manifested by her nervous behaviour during the further conversation. Maybe he even wasn't 100% sure before his ""n--ger"" comment. But he was at least sufficiently sure enough and Myra certainly didn't deny it.

5616,5616,8909,Do black holes have charges?,"Do black holes have charges? If so, how would they be measured? Also, does electricity behave the same way?  Black holes affect photons, which are carriers of EM radiation, so do black holes have any effect on the electric force?
",Ovi,https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/21904,"These are two separate questions. It's better if you don't try to combine two questions into one.

In answer to the first question, yes, a black hole can have a measurable charge. You measure it the same way you'd measure any other charge. This is all purely theoretical, however. Many real-life black holes have been observed and characterized by their masses, but there is no realistic chance that any black hole will ever have enough charge to be measurable.

The way we know that black holes can be charged is that there exist solutions to the Einstein field equations such as the Reissner–Nordström metric, in which a charged test particle experiences a force not experienced by a neutral test particle. The no-hair theorems for black holes explicitly allow electric charge as an observable type of ""hair"" that it is possible for a black hole to have.

In answer to the second question, Maxwell's equations can be expressed in tensor form, and in this form, they work equally well in general relativity.

",Greg McNulty,https://christianity.stackexchange.com/users/1400,"We don't know as much about the German religion as the Greek and Roman ones, because the Germans used less permanent materials in their society, and didn't really write things down. What we have regarding them now is whatever Romans and Greeks decided to write down, and whatever elements were, as you pointed out, incorpated into the culture after Christianization. 

""Odinism"" is polytheistic, while Christianity is ruthlessly monotheistic. At most a Christian could believe that the German gods were demons misleading people, or angels whose message was misunderstood. Most just say they were idols, or, for those like C. S. Lewis and G. K. Chesterton, saw the myths as factually false, but true in that they revealed a need of the human heart, a need that was fulfilled by Christ. Just as a boy might daydream about what his future wife might be like, and then later on in life meet her in reality, so the pagan myth makers were daydreaming about their Bridegroom, who they met Him for real by the Incarnation. For more detail regarding this, I highly, highly, recommend reading G. K. Chesterton's The Everlasting Man, especially the chapter ""Man and Mythologies,"" which is one of the best essays he has ever written.

There are many elements of German belief in our society that were incorpated into culture practiced by later Christians. For example, our English weekday calendar, except for Saturday (who is a Roman god), are all Anglo-Saxon deities. The name ""Easter"" refers to the Old English name for the month of April, who was a fertility goddess (just as April is itself named after the Greek fertility goddess Aphrodite). Santa Clause might be based on an Old Norse legend involving Odin/Wodin. Just because things were pagan, doesn't make them wrong per se, because paganism is the religion of humanity, or at least of a fallen humanity. When Christ came, He didn't come to reject all of paganism, for that would be to reject humanity. Rather, He, and the Church, took what was good, and rejected what was bad, based on the doctrines of faith, just as the Israelites savaged the spoils from Egypt. The spoils weren't wrong and evil per se, they were just in the hands of the pagans and the evildoers.

Think about it. The New Testament is written in common Greek, a language created by pagans and used by pagans. Do you really think the Apostles should have rejected the pagan language just because it was pagan?

Imagine that a class is the equivalent of a blue-print for a house. Image then that a house is to the blueprint as an instance of the class is for the class. You can have one class (blue-print) and multiple instances (houses) created from it.

Now common sense dictates that most of the functions/behaviors that a house (instance) can have/do, even though they are declared in the blue-print, cannot be used until an actual house (instance) is made out of that blue-print (class). Like, your blue print might contain in it the place where the light switches and the light bulbs should go, but you have no way of making those work on the blue-print, you have to actually build the house in order to be able to switch the light switch on and off and have certain light bulbs go on and off.

However, you might have some behavior that is applicable to the blue-print directly, and which you could use/access directly on the blue print without needing to make an actual house out of that blue print. Imagine that your blue-print has a button that, upon pressing, will display the footprint of the house contained in that blue print (by calculating all the lengths of the walls and such). Obviously you COULD build a house first, then go around measuring its footprint, but you can do this with he blue-print alone, so it would be more helpful to have this behavior implemented in the blue-print.

where count&gt; {is at least __} /*this is the part causing an error*/
group by count
order by count


You have an error in your SQL syntax...

2330,2330,3714,PHP - how to output a MySQL average store rating in a loop,"I have a table with ratings for every store in a directory. I want to display the average rating from each store on a business directory list page. I have the directory business listing page finished without the average rating.

I believe I have figured out how to create an average rating, but I don't know how to get the rating to output in the loop for each store.

Here is how I calculate the rating:

$result = mysql_query(""SELECT AVG(rating) FROM reviews GROUP BY store_id WHERE store_id = '$storeid'"");
$rating_for_page = mysql_fetch_row($result);
$rating = $rating_for_page[0];

",Michael Falciglia,https://stackoverflow.com/users/2069839,"You should iterate through the results if I am understanding the issue correctly. Also, in your MySQL command you need to set an AS for the AVG(rating). And I have set mysql_fetch_assoc (instead of mysql_fetch_row) for the results to be returned in an associative array:

foreach ($storeids as $storeid) {
  $result = mysql_query(""SELECT AVG(rating) AS rating FROM reviews GROUP BY store_id WHERE store_id = '$storeid'"");
  while ($row = mysql_fetch_assoc($result)) {
    echo $row['rating'];
  }

I want to display the average rating from each store on a business directory list page. I have the directory business listing page finished without the average rating.

I believe I have figured out how to create an average rating, but I don't know how to get the rating to output in the loop for each store.

Here is how I calculate the rating:

$result = mysql_query(""SELECT AVG(rating) FROM reviews GROUP BY store_id WHERE store_id = '$storeid'"");
$rating_for_page = mysql_fetch_row($result);
$rating = $rating_for_page[0];

","You should iterate through the results if I am understanding the issue correctly. Also, in your MySQL command you need to set an AS for the AVG(rating). And I have set mysql_fetch_assoc (instead of mysql_fetch_row) for the results to be returned in an associative array:

foreach ($storeids as $storeid) {
  $result = mysql_query(""SELECT AVG(rating) AS rating FROM reviews GROUP BY store_id WHERE store_id = '$storeid'"");
  while ($row = mysql_fetch_assoc($result)) {
    echo $row['rating'];

","$http performs asynchronously and may or may not be finished at any given point in time which is why your return statement dont work. 

Use $q or simply handle the promise inside the controller:

         getProjects : function () {
            return $http.get('projects.json', { data: {} })

So I tried it and was very disappointed. Nearly every solder joint was looking different. Some of them were (partially) shiny; some (the most) of them were dull. And the worst thing was, that even with additional flux, the solder didn't flow like the leaded. So there is no way, I could solder fine pith SMD stuff with it.

I’m using a JBC soldering iron station with a C245-907 2.2mm chisel tip and tried different temperatures starting with 290°C to 360°C. The best results I get with about 315°C, with 350°C I got the worst results. I used the Amtech NC-559 Flux – the original, not the fake from china. 

Some other guys told me, that maybe the solder wire is not the best. That's why I'm looking for other soldering wires. But there are so many on market. Some with copper, some are Sn96.5Ag3.5 like the Amtech ASN96A3.5-0.50.

5055,5055,8040,Does War Stomp exhaust me before I am the defender?,"This question is related to the World of Warcraft Trading Card Game.

I have a Hunter, no allies out, and in my hand is a Frost Trap.



My opponent attacks with Himul Longstrider, who has War Stomp. He wants to target my hero with the War Stomp power.



Will my hero be exhausted before I am able to pay the cost of Frost Trap?  Put another way, does War Stomp exhaust my hero before my hero is ""defending,"" thus preventing me from paying its cost by exhausting my hero?
",Mag Roader,https://boardgames.stackexchange.com/users/33,"Yes.

According to answers on the wowtcg.com forums, War Stomp triggers in two different places, depending on whether the character with War Stomp is attacking or defending.


  If attacking, then War Stomp triggers at the beginning of the Attack Window, just after the attacker exhausts for that attack.
  Since this happens before the Protect Point, you can exhaust a protector before they can protect with it.
  
  If defending, then War Stomp triggers at the beginning of the Defend Window, just after the Protect Point.
  You cannot use War Stomp while defending to stop the current attack, but you can exhaust another character to stop them from attacking that turn.""


The upshot of this is that when you are attacked by an ally with War Stomp, the attacker can exhaust your hero before the Protect Point, when you are still just the proposed defender. Since you're not yet the defender, you can't respond by exhausting your hero to pay Frost Trap's cost.

I have a Hunter, no allies out, and in my hand is a Frost Trap.



My opponent attacks with Himul Longstrider, who has War Stomp. He wants to target my hero with the War Stomp power.



Will my hero be exhausted before I am able to pay the cost of Frost Trap?  Put another way, does War Stomp exhaust my hero before my hero is ""defending,"" thus preventing me from paying its cost by exhausting my hero?
","Yes.

According to answers on the wowtcg.com forums, War Stomp triggers in two different places, depending on whether the character with War Stomp is attacking or defending.


  If attacking, then War Stomp triggers at the beginning of the Attack Window, just after the attacker exhausts for that attack.
  Since this happens before the Protect Point, you can exhaust a protector before they can protect with it.
  
  If defending, then War Stomp triggers at the beginning of the Defend Window, just after the Protect Point.
  You cannot use War Stomp while defending to stop the current attack, but you can exhaust another character to stop them from attacking that turn.""


The upshot of this is that when you are attacked by an ally with War Stomp, the attacker can exhaust your hero before the Protect Point, when you are still just the proposed defender. Since you're not yet the defender, you can't respond by exhausting your hero to pay Frost Trap's cost.

",prasad,https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/77604,"According to the CCS user guide:


  Console I/O (CIO) functions, such as printf, require the use of a breakpoint. If these functions are compiled in, but you do not wish to use a breakpoint, disable CIO functionality by changing the option in Project → Properties → CCS Debug Settings → Target → Generic Debug Options → Enable CIO function use.


According to the TI Forums:


  The Debug project properties control if the CCS debugger attempts to perform CIO, and not the allocation of the .cio section on the target.
  
  To prevent the .cio section being allocated on the target you have to ensure there are no calls to run time library functions which use CIO, e.g. ensure there are no calls to printf() in the code.


Later on it mentions:


  Turns out I had some _assert(0) statements in one of my libraries.  This would in turn bring in stdio, which would demand a .cio section, consuming ~400 bytes of RAM.

","According to the CCS user guide:


  Console I/O (CIO) functions, such as printf, require the use of a breakpoint. If these functions are compiled in, but you do not wish to use a breakpoint, disable CIO functionality by changing the option in Project → Properties → CCS Debug Settings → Target → Generic Debug Options → Enable CIO function use.


According to the TI Forums:


  The Debug project properties control if the CCS debugger attempts to perform CIO, and not the allocation of the .cio section on the target.
  
  To prevent the .cio section being allocated on the target you have to ensure there are no calls to run time library functions which use CIO, e.g. ensure there are no calls to printf() in the code.


Later on it mentions:


  Turns out I had some _assert(0) statements in one of my libraries.  This would in turn bring in stdio, which would demand a .cio section, consuming ~400 bytes of RAM.


Mind which libraries you use.

",NOhs,https://mathematica.stackexchange.com/users/21557,"To solve this problem under the assumption that the stated quantities are small, you can insert a perturbation expansion for the unknown phi and solve for its expansion coefficients in the smallness parameter:

First I'm copying the definitions from the question to be self-contained:

Ecp = (s1*s3*Abs[J]/DE^2/2 - 
         1/DE*s2*s3*KroneckerDelta[1, s1])*(t1^2 - t2^2) /. 
      KroneckerDelta[1, s1] -&gt; (1 + s1)/2 /. t1 -&gt; tt1*DE /.

Ec2p = s2/DE^2*KroneckerDelta[1, s1] (t1^2 - t2^2)^2/Abs[J] /. 
      KroneckerDelta[1, s1] -&gt; (1 + s1)/2 /. t1 -&gt; tt1*DE /. 
    t2 -&gt; tt2*DE /. xi -&gt; xii*DE /. J -&gt; Jj*DE
Esp = s2*s3/DE^2*t1*t2*xi*
        Abs[J]/(Abs[xi] KroneckerDelta[-1, s1] + 
           Abs[J] KroneckerDelta[1, s1]) /.

    t2 -&gt; tt2*DE /. xi -&gt; xii*DE /. J -&gt; Jj*DE


Now I define the derivative that you're trying to set to zero:

deriv = 
 D[E00 + Cos[phi]*Ecp + Cos[phi]^2*Ec2p + Sin[phi]*Esp, phi]

(*
==&gt; (DE s2 s3 tt1 tt2 xii Abs[DE Jj] Cos[phi])/(
 1/2 (1 + s1) Abs[DE Jj] + 
  1/2 (1 - s1) Abs[DE xii]) - (DE^2 tt1^2 - 
    DE^2 tt2^2) (-(((1 + s1) s2 s3)/(2 DE)) + (s1 s3 Abs[DE Jj])/(
    2 DE^2)) Sin[phi] - ((1 + s1) s2 (DE^2 tt1^2 - DE^2 tt2^2)^2 Cos[
   phi] Sin[phi])/(DE^2 Abs[DE Jj])
*)


Now I make the assumption that tt1, tt2, Jj, xii are all proportional to the small parameter ϵ and that I can then also write phi = ϕ0 + ϵ ϕ1 to first order in that small parameter. The expansion of deriv in powers of ϵ has two nonvanishing terms if we go to third order. Setting these two non-vanishing terms to zero allows us to solve for the two unknowns ϕ0 and ϕ1. This solves the problem of finding phi to first order in the small parameter.

eq=E0[x,y,z]+E1[x,y,z]*Cos[phi]+E2[x,y,z]*Cos[phi]^2+E3[x,y,z]*Sin[phi]


Now E0,E1,E2 and E3 are already series expansions of expressions in x,y,z. Therefore I would like to series expand the result of 

Solve[D[eq,phi]==0,phi]


However, this is some giant arctan expression and Mathematica seems to take forever. 

Question: Is there a more clever approach to this (not calling Series at the end only), or is there some way I can tune the Series command?

Here are the real expressions I am dealing with, if someone wants to try something out:

Ecp = (s1*s3*Abs[J]/DE^2/2 - 1/DE*s2*s3*KroneckerDelta[1, s1])*(t1^2 -
      t2^2) /. KroneckerDelta[1, s1] -&gt; (1 + s1)/2 /. 
 t1 -&gt; tt1*DE /. t2 -&gt; tt2*DE /. xi -&gt; xii*DE /. J -&gt; Jj*DE
Ec2p = s2/DE^2*KroneckerDelta[1, s1] (t1^2 - t2^2)^2/Abs[J] /. 
  KroneckerDelta[1, s1] -&gt; (1 + s1)/2 /. t1 -&gt; tt1*DE /. 
t2 -&gt; tt2*DE /. xi -&gt; xii*DE /. J -&gt; Jj*DE
Esp = s2*s3/DE^2*t1*t2*xi*
    Abs[J]/(Abs[xi] KroneckerDelta[-1, s1] + 
       Abs[J] KroneckerDelta[1, s1]) /. 
   KroneckerDelta[1, s1] -&gt; (1 + s1)/2 /. 
  KroneckerDelta[-1, s1] -&gt; (1 - s1)/2 /. t1 -&gt; tt1*DE /. 
t2 -&gt; tt2*DE /. xi -&gt; xii*DE /. J -&gt; Jj*DE
Solve[D[E00 + Cos[phi]*Ecp + Cos[phi]^2*Ec2p + Sin[phi]*Esp, phi] == 0, phi]


The small parameters are tt1,tt2,Jj,xii. Usually I then introduce a ""smallness-paramter"" as suggested here on SE to perform the multi series.
","To solve this problem under the assumption that the stated quantities are small, you can insert a perturbation expansion for the unknown phi and solve for its expansion coefficients in the smallness parameter:

First I'm copying the definitions from the question to be self-contained:

Ecp = (s1*s3*Abs[J]/DE^2/2 - 
         1/DE*s2*s3*KroneckerDelta[1, s1])*(t1^2 - t2^2) /. 
      KroneckerDelta[1, s1] -&gt; (1 + s1)/2 /. t1 -&gt; tt1*DE /. 
    t2 -&gt; tt2*DE /. xi -&gt; xii*DE /. J -&gt; Jj*DE
Ec2p = s2/DE^2*KroneckerDelta[1, s1] (t1^2 - t2^2)^2/Abs[J] /. 
      KroneckerDelta[1, s1] -&gt; (1 + s1)/2 /. t1 -&gt; tt1*DE /. 
    t2 -&gt; tt2*DE /. xi -&gt; xii*DE /. J -&gt; Jj*DE
Esp = s2*s3/DE^2*t1*t2*xi*
        Abs[J]/(Abs[xi] KroneckerDelta[-1, s1] + 
           Abs[J] KroneckerDelta[1, s1]) /. 
       KroneckerDelta[1, s1] -&gt; (1 + s1)/2 /. 
      KroneckerDelta[-1, s1] -&gt; (1 - s1)/2 /. t1 -&gt; tt1*DE /. 
    t2 -&gt; tt2*DE /. xi -&gt; xii*DE /. J -&gt; Jj*DE


Now I define the derivative that you're trying to set to zero:

deriv = 
 D[E00 + Cos[phi]*Ecp + Cos[phi]^2*Ec2p + Sin[phi]*Esp, phi]

(*
==&gt; (DE s2 s3 tt1 tt2 xii Abs[DE Jj] Cos[phi])/(
 1/2 (1 + s1) Abs[DE Jj] + 
  1/2 (1 - s1) Abs[DE xii]) - (DE^2 tt1^2 - 
    DE^2 tt2^2) (-(((1 + s1) s2 s3)/(2 DE)) + (s1 s3 Abs[DE Jj])/(
    2 DE^2)) Sin[phi] - ((1 + s1) s2 (DE^2 tt1^2 - DE^2 tt2^2)^2 Cos[
   phi] Sin[phi])/(DE^2 Abs[DE Jj])
*)


Now I make the assumption that tt1, tt2, Jj, xii are all proportional to the small parameter ϵ and that I can then also write phi = ϕ0 + ϵ ϕ1 to first order in that small parameter. The expansion of deriv in powers of ϵ has two nonvanishing terms if we go to third order. Setting these two non-vanishing terms to zero allows us to solve for the two unknowns ϕ0 and ϕ1. This solves the problem of finding phi to first order in the small parameter. 

Solve[
 Thread[CoefficientList[
    Normal@Series[
      Simplify[
       deriv /. 
         Thread[{tt1, tt2, Jj, 
            xii} -&gt; ϵ {tt1, tt2, Jj, xii}] /. 
        phi -&gt; (ϕ0 + ϵ ϕ1), 
       DE Jj ϵ &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; DE xii ϵ &gt; 0], {ϵ, 0,
        3}], ϵ] == 0], {ϕ0, ϕ1}]

(*

4358,4358,6933,Why is it not dangerous to dissolve NaCl?,"$$\ce{H2O~(l) + NaCl~(s) -&gt;[\Delta] Na+~(aq) + Cl^{-}~(aq)}$$

When table salt is placed in water, it dissolves due to the polarity of water molecules. When solvation takes place, negatively polar sides of water molecules attach to $\ce{Na+}$ ions, and positively polar sides of water molecules attach to $\ce{Cl-}$ ions. The ions are then carried away by water molecules through diffusion. Since the sodium is now isolated from the chlorine, what keeps it from violently exploding with water in the following chemical reaction?

$$\ce{2Na + 2H2O -&gt; 2 NaOH + H2}$$

Also, since chlorine is poisonous, wouldn't that make drinking salted water extremely lethal?
",Daniel Pendergast,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/users/143,"[A really-good answer to this question should include quantitative evidence, but here is my hand-waving version...]

Solvated sodium ions ($\ce{Na+}$) aren't all that reactive.  Surrounded by a lot of polar water molecules, they're actually quite stable.  What you're thinking of is solid sodium (Na) which will ""react violently with water"" until it's all dissolved - dissolved that is, into stable sodium ions.

Same kind of logic applies to chlorine.  Solvated chloride ions ($\ce{Cl-}$) are stable and not nearly as poisonous as chlorine gas. (Note:  everything is poisonous at some level, i.e. ""the poison is in the dose"".  In saying chlorine gas is more poison, that really just means it is a more 'potent' poison:  it will kill at lower doses compared to chloride ions.)

4838,4838,7696,Do inner shell electrons feel the electric field/force from an outer shell electron in an atom?,"We just finished studying Gauss’ law and were puzzled by this thought. If I look at a copper atom and focus on the 29th electron in the 4th shell, according to Gauss’ law, I can draw a Gaussian surface that completely encloses the first three shells plus the nucleus. It is my understanding that the 29th electron will not contribute to the E-field inside this Gaussian because this charge is outside the Gaussian.  However, it does not mean that the 29th electron doesn’t apply an electric force on the inner electrons, especially the 3rd shell electrons. So here is my dilemma: wouldn’t this effect the E-field of the inner shell electrons?

Please, if possible, answer this question without quantum if possible.
",Lisa Lee,https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/29653,"It is a misconception to think that just because the 29th electron is outside the gaussian surface, it will not have an effect on the electric field inside it. The total flux through the surface is indeed zero, but that doesn't mean there is no influence: imagine a point charge and draw up a sphere next to it. The electric field goes in on one face and out the other to make a zero flux, but there's definitely a field inside.

The situation for copper is slightly more complicated because the  electron is in a spherically symmetric s orbital. This does reduce its influence on the inner electrons, not because of Gauss's law but because of a theorem of Newton:


  the electric field due to a spherical shell of charge vanishes inside it.


However, the 4s orbital is not simply a spherical shell of charge around the [Ar] 3d10 core. Even in the most simplistic, hydrogen-based models, the higher s orbitals still have a sizable probability of being inside the core, and have multiple shells of positive probability:



 Source: Wikipedia. Note that this is a 6s hydrogen orbital with no actual relation to copper; a 4s orbital has four such spherical shells.

Because of this, the 4s electron does create a nonzero electric field inside the atomic core, and this does affect the inner electrons.



As you have guessed, of course, in real life this is much, much more complicated, and quantum chemists will send you packing if you tell them you need an accurate ab initio description of the whole copper atom all the way to the 1s2 core. The electrons are highly correlated, and all of them interact strongly with each other, including such lovely job-simplifying features like exchange interactions. Quantum mechanically, the bottom line to your question is that it's meaningless to talk about ""the 29th electron,"" because all the electrons are indistinguishable and therefore you must consider them all as a whole. (Specifically, ""the charge density due to the electron in the 4s orbital"" is not a meaningful physical quantity.)

However, the quantumness actually helps. The reason for this is clear if you try to come up with a classical model of a copper atom. Even if you preserved the shell structure with the lone 4s electron orbiting well outside them, the inner electrons will be a hugely complicated jumble of electrons whizzing around, and the system will be nowhere near spherically symmetric. While you can still draw a gaussian sphere and get information about the total flux, this does not help at all in describing the electric field at any particular point.

In the quantum case, on the other hand, everything is much simpler. You have a bunch of closed shells and a single $s$ electron, and this means that the whole atom is spherically symmetric. Electric fields must be radial and uniform, and drawing gaussian spheres does help you calculate the electric field at a given radius.

But I would like to handle separately the 'WHEELUP' and 'WHEELDOWN' events. I tried several others flags in my condition but without success. Does anyone can help me, please ?

Thanks a lot in advance for your help.
","According to the SDL documentation:


  Movements to the left generate negative x values and to the right
  generate positive x values. Movements down (scroll backward) generate
  negative y values and up (scroll forward) generate positive y values.


So in your case, you could modify the code as such:

case SDL_MOUSEWHEEL:
    if(evenements.x &lt; 0)
    {
        std::cout &lt;&lt; ""MOUSE : WHEEL LEFT"" &lt;&lt; std::endl;
    }
    else if(evenements.x &gt; 0)
    {
        std::cout &lt;&lt; ""MOUSE : WHEEL RIGHT"" &lt;&lt; std::endl;
    }
    if(evenements.y &lt; 0)
    {
        std::cout &lt;&lt; ""MOUSE : WHEEL DOWN"" &lt;&lt; std::endl;
    }
    else if(evenements.y &gt; 0)
    {
        std::cout &lt;&lt; ""MOUSE : WHEEL UP"" &lt;&lt; std::endl;
    }
    break;

4454,4454,7068,Get IP network range after reverse DNS?,"For analytics purposes, I'm looking at large sets of IP addresses in server log files. I'm trying to perform reverse-DNS lookups to understand where traffic is coming from - e.g. what percentage of IPs resolve to corporations, schools, government, international etc.

Despite a bunch of optimizations, individually reverse-DNS'ing every IP address still appears to be fairly expensive though. So -

is there any way to obtain an entire range of IPs from a reverse-DNS?

If yes, this could greatly reduce the number of actual reverse-DNS lookups.

Example (numbers slightly obfuscated): 


Log file contains a request from an IP 128.151.162.17
Reverse DNS resolves to 11.142.152.128.in-addr.arpa 21599 IN PTR alamo.ceas.rochester.edu
(So this is a visitor from Rochester University, rochester.edu)
Now, would it be safe to assume that all at least all IPs from 128.151.162.* will also resolve to rochester.edu?
What about 128.151.*.*? Is there a way to get the exact IP range?

If you are doing a lot of DNS queries, rate-limit how many you send to any particular DNS server.  Otherwise it is rude at best, and a DoS attack at worst.


If you can generate all the DNS queries you plan on doing ahead of time, and they'll fit in RAM or on disk, generate the list, randomize it, then do the lookups in random order.

4970,4970,7916,Sloshing Sound Under Dash,"I have a 2011 Suzuki SX4 Crossover AWD with MT.  Sometimes when I start it up, begin moving forward, or quickly decelerate I can hear what sounds like water (or some other liquid) moving from one place to another (can't quite tell where) under the dash or maybe just behind the firewall.  I took it to the Suzuki service center (almost 2 hour drive from my home), and they told me that the A/C coolant was low.  They refilled it and sent me on my way.  However, I still hear the sloshing sound behind the dash.  Does anyone have any ideas on what this might be?  Thanks.

ADDITIONAL INFO

I've recently noticed that when this ""running water"" sound occurs that it is more prominent when the engine is running faster (e.g. during acceleration).  This leads me to believe maybe this has something to do with the water pump, or some other liquid pump, that is run by the engine and not moving enough liquid to fill the pipe, hence a sloshing / running water sound.
",Jim Fell,https://mechanics.stackexchange.com/users/1211,"Your AC drain may be stopped up. Your AC evaporator condenses water when the warm moist air passes over it, this happens in the normal operation of the AC. There is a drain that is suppose to drain the water outside the car, when it gets stopped up water collects in the evaporator case under the dash, it will eventually drain somewhere, most likely on your carpet inside the car, in the mean time you will be able to hear it sloshing around. 

Look under you hood, or from the underside of the car for a rubber tube sticking out of the firewall, you can unplug it with a coat hanger, or piece of wire.

In June normally all Thailand except the southern Gulf is in monsoon. The southern Gulf's (Samui and neighbours plus adjacent mainland coast) usual wet season is Oct into Jan. I can't speak for what the day light is like during that time however.

The recommended range for the flash isn't more than about 100mm, past that, its usefulness is limited. Using the integrated diffusion panel allows extended wide-angle coverage to 14mm.

It wouldn't hurt to have a better flash than the integrated one but it all depends on what you'll be shooting. With the 15-55mm lens i'd expect the integrated flash to do good enough.

It really depends on what you'll be shooting and what you'll be using the flash for. I used a couple of generic hand-held flashes for light painting in caves in Thailand. I thoroughly recommend them for this purpose!

example here
",user2199734,https://stackoverflow.com/users/2199734,"You could do this:

         update yourTable

Every row in the table that has a 3 in the someColumn column will then have that final column set to your desired value. 

If this isn't what you want, please make your question clearer.  Are you trying to put the name of the hospital into this table? If so, that is not a good idea and there are better ways to accomplish that.

Furthermore, if every row with a certain value (3) gets this value, you could simply add it to the other (i.e. Hospitals) table. No need to repeat it everywhere in the table that points back to the Hospitals table.

add_filter( 'the_title', 'remove_page_title' );

function remove_page_title() {

Here's your original code:

add_filter( 'the_title', 'remove_page_title' );

function remove_page_title() {
   if(is_page('138')) {
   }
   return '';
}


What it's doing is adding a filter on the_title that doesn't accept any parameters.  That's your first mistake.  The the_title filter actually takes two parameters - the page/post title and the page/post id.  So first, let's rewrite our hook:

add_filter( 'the_title', 'remove_page_title', 10, 2 );
function remove_page_title( $title, $id ) {

}


This assigns our filter with a priority of 10 and lets us accept both parameters sent in by the filter.  Then we specify the parameters our function accepts.

Inside the function, we want to check if we're on the right page.  If we are, return '', if we aren't return the title:

if( '138' == $id ) return '';

return $title;


Your original function was always returning '' when the filter ran.  That's why you were getting a blank title on every page, not just the page you wanted.

My problem is that when I use an SVM my labels are all of certainty 1 or 0.

",Blight,https://stats.stackexchange.com/users/67103,"SVM are not designed to estimate probability of a class. Nevertheless, there is a way to estimate such probabilities, using Platt scaling.

There is SVM-like probabilistic method, namely, Relevance Vector Machines. Unfortunately, they're patented by Microsoft, though, apparently, free to use in academia.

Finally, if you want to find these xs where SVM is unsure about correct labeling, you can do it even without probability. The decision rule of SVM is

$$
class(x) = \begin{cases}
1, &amp; \mathbf w^T x + b &gt; 0 \\
0, &amp; \mathbf w^T x + b &lt; 0

Where $\mathbf w^T x + b$ is SVM's decision function, effectively, a signed distance to the separating hyperplane. If this distance (modulo of it) is too small — SVM is less sure about $x$. You can come up with some kind of threshold on decision functions to find vectors of interest.



About MaxEnt vs. (linear) SVM:

It's mostly opinion-based, but their loss functions are quite similar



SVM's loss is called ""Hinge loss"", MaxEnt's — ""Logistic"".

Asymptotically (as signed distance goes to $\pm \infty$) they're the same (modulo scaling constant because of arbitrary log base in Logistic loss), so if you data is well-separable, both should perform fine. Both methods will find a separating hyperplane, though, SVM's one will have a bigger margin (because it's a max-margin classifier).

When data is not linear separable, SVM will try to push as many points behind the boundary of distance = $\pm$ 1, thus having 0 loss on them, while logistic loss may tolerate some errors to become even more confident in already correctly labeled samples.

This is my opinion, it is not necessarily true :-)

Typically, I'll brighten or adjust a shadowed area or contrast, that sort of thing. Sometimes I'll hide a defect (such as a person who walked in front of a shot) by copying adjacent background over the top.

Is it possible to darken gray hair with GraphicConverter?  I've tried selecting the hair (using either lasso or polygon selector) and then darkening the selection or adjusting the gamma, but this always ends up with a sharp line around the selection.
","Graphicconverter for OSX didn't add Dodge/Burn capabilities until version 9.2 this month. This is quite amazing that it was missing until now considering they are trying to compare to Adobe Photo shop. Using this  functionality will likely achieve what you are describing, although you could also do it with layers and fine selection of the hair depending on the image.

3802,3802,6045,Earth-Moon orbiting each other after being engulfed by Red Giant,"Recently some exoplanets were discovered which are thought to be the leftover cores of giant planets that had survived a star becoming a Red Giant and then shrinking back to a subdwarf.

If giant planet cores can last the lifetime of a Red Giant, then maybe smaller planets can survive at least for a while.

When the Sun becomes Red Giant, if the Sun engulfs the Earth and Moon before they have evaporated, what will happen to the Earth-Moon orbit ? Will they be crashed into each other, or will they drift apart or will the orbit remain stable for a while before they are melted and evaporated away?

Edit: Newly found planets are 'roasted remains' BBC News, 21 December 2011

Edit: More planetary systems around white dwarfs (WD 0421+162 and WD 0431+126) that shows signs of planets being consumed by the stars.  http://news.discovery.com/space/alien-life-exoplanets/hubble-discovers-planet-graveyard-130509.htm
",vtt,https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/11785,"The problem with answering your question is that red giant stars don't have a well defined edge. It's a bit like Earth's atmosphere. The density gets gradually lower as you move away from the centre but it's hard to draw a line and say ""this the edge"". So when you say the Sun engulfs the Earth, it depends on how deep into the Sun the Earth gets and how long it stays there.

I'd guess you're talking about the planet orbiting V391 Pegasi, and this does seem to have originally orbited at about the Earth's orbit. However it's much much heavier than the Earth so there would have been more of it to evaporate and it would survive longer than the Earth.

If giant planet cores can last the lifetime of a Red Giant, then maybe smaller planets can survive at least for a while.

When the Sun becomes Red Giant, if the Sun engulfs the Earth and Moon before they have evaporated, what will happen to the Earth-Moon orbit ? Will they be crashed into each other, or will they drift apart or will the orbit remain stable for a while before they are melted and evaporated away?

Edit: Newly found planets are 'roasted remains' BBC News, 21 December 2011

Edit: More planetary systems around white dwarfs (WD 0421+162 and WD 0431+126) that shows signs of planets being consumed by the stars.  http://news.discovery.com/space/alien-life-exoplanets/hubble-discovers-planet-graveyard-130509.htm
","The problem with answering your question is that red giant stars don't have a well defined edge. It's a bit like Earth's atmosphere. The density gets gradually lower as you move away from the centre but it's hard to draw a line and say ""this the edge"". So when you say the Sun engulfs the Earth, it depends on how deep into the Sun the Earth gets and how long it stays there.

I'd guess you're talking about the planet orbiting V391 Pegasi, and this does seem to have originally orbited at about the Earth's orbit. However it's much much heavier than the Earth so there would have been more of it to evaporate and it would survive longer than the Earth. We don't know exactly what the planet's original orbit was, or how big V391 Pegasi got during it's red dwarf phase, and we don't know how much of the planet was evaporated.

I think the best that we can say is it neither proves the Earth-Moon system will be destroyed nor proves that it will definitely survive. It does suggest that the possibility exists.

",luminus,https://blender.stackexchange.com/users/1789,"Finding the parameters necessary to generate such a shape should be possible with python.

From the wiki:


  The Shape setting determines the collision shape of the object. The
  following shapes are available:
  
  Primitive shapes - these are best in terms of memory/performance but don't necessarily reflect the actual shape of the object. They're
  calculated based on the object's bounding box. The center of gravity
  is always in the middle for now.
  
  
  Box: The size per axis is calculated from the bounding box
  Sphere: The radius is the largest axis of the bounding box
  Capsule: This points up the Z-Axis.
  Cylinder: This points up the Z-Axis. The height is taken from the z-axis, while the radius is the larger of the x/y-axes.
  Cone: This points up the Z-Axis. The height is taken from the z-axis, while the radius is the larger of the x/y-axes. 
  
  
  'Mesh based shapes' - these are calculated based on the geometry
  of the object so they are a better representation of the object. The
  center of gravity for these shapes is the object origin.
  
  
  Convex Hull: Convex approximation of the object, has good performance and stability.
  Mesh: Allows to simulate concave objects, but is rather slow and unstable.
  


To build these shapes using the UI:

Box:


Select the target object and press CtrlShiftAltC > Origin to goemetry, and then press F6 and select bounds center.
With the target object selected, press ShiftS> Cursor to selected to move the cursor to the objects origin.
Add a cube to be the bounding box. It will automatically be centered at the 3D cursor, which is snapped to the target object's origin point.
Copy the Dimension and Rotation values from the target object to the bounding cube. These values are located on the Properties region (N in the 3D view):



You can quickly copy and paste values by hovering over the number field and pressing CtrlC/CtrlV accordingly.

Since this process of copying and pasting the values of each channel can be a bit tedious, you can use a quick bit of python to do this for you:

import bpy

active = bpy.context.active_object
selected = bpy.context.selected_objects

for obj in selected:
    obj.dimensions = active.dimensions


This copies the dimensions from the active object to the selected objects.
Parent the bounding box to the target object so the relative location, rotation, and scale is kept the same. You can also set the bounding cube's Draw type to Wire in Properties > Object > Display > Maximum Draw Type.


Sphere


Do steps 1 to 3  from the Box instructions, adding a sphere instead of a cube. 
Copy only the largest dimension value from the target into all three dimensions of the sphere.
Do step 3 of the instructions for Box (Parent the bounding mesh and set the draw type to wire)




Cylinder


Do steps 1 to 3  from the Box instructions, adding a cylinder instead of a cube.
Copy the largest dimension value of the target excluding the Z axis, so the value of either X or Y into both the X and Y dimensions of the Cylinder.
Copy the Z dimension value of the target to the Cylinder.
Do step 3 of the instructions for Box (Parent the bounding mesh and set the draw type to wire).


Cone


Do the same as for Sphere.


Convex Hull

This is more complex. you could try to generate your own using python, or you could try one of these existing options:


The Convex Hull operator built into blender. 


Duplicate target object (ShiftD)
With the duplicate selected, enter edit mode (Tab) and select all (A)

"
309,309,498,Unique Existence and the Axiom of Choice,"The axiom of choice states that arbitrary products of nonempty sets are nonempty. 
Clearly, we only need the axiom of choice to show the non-emptiness of the product if 
there are infinitely many choice functions. If we use a choice function to construct a mathematical object, the object will often depend on the specific choice function being used. So constructions that require the axiom of choice often do not provide the existence of a unique object with certain properties. In some cases they do, however. The existence of a cardinal number for every set (ordinal that can be mapped bijectively onto the set) is such an example.


  What are natural examples outside of
  set theory where the existence of a
  unique mathematical object with
  certain properties can only be proven
  with the axiom of choice and where the
  uniqueness itself can be proven in ZFC (I
  don't want the uniqueness to depend on
  a specific model of ZFC)? 


The next question is a bit more vague, but I would be interested in some kind of birds-eye view on the issue.


  Are there some general guidelines to understand in which cases the axiom of choice can be  used to construct a provably unique object with certain properties?


This question is motivated by a discussion of uniqueness-properties of certain measure theoretic constructions in mathematical economics that make heavy use of non-standard analysis. 

Edit: Examples so far can be classified in three categories: 

Cardinal Invariants: One uses the axiom of choice to construct a representation by some ordinal. Since ordinals are canonically well ordered, this gives us a unique, definable object with the wanted properties. Example: One takes the dimension (as a cardianl) of a vector space and constructs the vector space as functions on finite subsets of the cardinal (François G. Dorais).

AC Properties: One constructs the object canonically ""by hand"" and then uses the axiom of choice to show that it has a certain property. Trivial example:  $2^\mathbb{R}$ as the family of well-orderable sets of reals.

Employing all choice functions: Here one gets uniqueness by requiring the object to contain in some sense all objects of a certain kind that can be obtained by AC. Examples: The Stone-Čech compactification as the set of all ultrafilters on it (Juris Steprans), or the dual space of a vector space, the space of all linear functionals. (Martin Brandenburg) The AC is used to show that these spaces are rich enough. Formally, these examples might be categorized in the second category, but they seem to have a different flavor.
",Michael Greinecker,https://mathoverflow.net/users/35357,"If you are satisified with your example of the cardinals as unique objects defined using choice then there is an easy answer to your question. Note that there is not a unique ordinal which is in bijective correspondence with each set; there are many, but there is always a least one which we call a cardinal. So the uniqueness comes from the well ordering of the ordinals. Given the axiom of choice you can always well order the domain of objects in which you are interested and then choose the least one. This will of course, be unique, but I doubt this is what you had in mind. But I think it does show that a better example than the cardinals is needed for uniqueness.

One can construct saturated models by transfinite induction and then show that, under certain circumstances, these are unique. One also has $\beta \mathbb{N}\setminus \mathbb{N}$ which needs choice to be non-empty, and it is also unique --- but probably also not what you had in mind.

Clearly, we only need the axiom of choice to show the non-emptiness of the product if 
there are infinitely many choice functions. If we use a choice function to construct a mathematical object, the object will often depend on the specific choice function being used. So constructions that require the axiom of choice often do not provide the existence of a unique object with certain properties. In some cases they do, however. The existence of a cardinal number for every set (ordinal that can be mapped bijectively onto the set) is such an example.


  What are natural examples outside of
  set theory where the existence of a
  unique mathematical object with
  certain properties can only be proven
  with the axiom of choice and where the
  uniqueness itself can be proven in ZFC (I
  don't want the uniqueness to depend on
  a specific model of ZFC)? 


The next question is a bit more vague, but I would be interested in some kind of birds-eye view on the issue.


  Are there some general guidelines to understand in which cases the axiom of choice can be  used to construct a provably unique object with certain properties?


This question is motivated by a discussion of uniqueness-properties of certain measure theoretic constructions in mathematical economics that make heavy use of non-standard analysis. 

Edit: Examples so far can be classified in three categories: 

Cardinal Invariants: One uses the axiom of choice to construct a representation by some ordinal. Since ordinals are canonically well ordered, this gives us a unique, definable object with the wanted properties. Example: One takes the dimension (as a cardianl) of a vector space and constructs the vector space as functions on finite subsets of the cardinal (François G. Dorais).

AC Properties: One constructs the object canonically ""by hand"" and then uses the axiom of choice to show that it has a certain property. Trivial example:  $2^\mathbb{R}$ as the family of well-orderable sets of reals.

Employing all choice functions: Here one gets uniqueness by requiring the object to contain in some sense all objects of a certain kind that can be obtained by AC. Examples: The Stone-Čech compactification as the set of all ultrafilters on it (Juris Steprans), or the dual space of a vector space, the space of all linear functionals. (Martin Brandenburg) The AC is used to show that these spaces are rich enough. Formally, these examples might be categorized in the second category, but they seem to have a different flavor.
","If you are satisfied with the cardinality example of a unique object defined using choice, then your question has a simple answer. Note that no single ordinal number corresponds to every set in bijection; there are many, but there is always one that we call cardinality. So uniqueness comes from the order of ordinal numbers. Given the axiom of choice, you can always well command the domain of the object you are interested in, and then choose at least one. Of course, it's unique, but I doubt it's your idea. But I think it does show that uniqueness requires a better example than cardinality."

For a plane wave and imagining it as a fluid bouncing off the reflection wall at $x=0$, find the force in terms of $\phi'(0)$, the derivative of wave function at $x=0$. 

We know, for a reflecting fluid, $\textrm{force }= \frac{dp}{dt}$, where $p$ is momentum. Classically, $p=mv$. In our case, $v$ is $\hbar k/m$, the velocity of the plane wave. Instead of mass, we have $|\phi|^2dx$, the probability of finding the massive particle in an interval $dx$. So $p= \frac{\hbar k}{m}|\phi|^2 dx$. Then, force $f=\frac{dp}{dt} =\frac{d(|\phi|^2 dx \hbar k/m)}{dt}$

$\frac{d(|\phi|^2)}{dt}=-\frac{dj}{dx}$, where $j$ is probability current = $\hbar k/m |\phi|^2$.
So $f=\frac{dp}{dt}=\left(\frac{\hbar k}{m}\right)^2 \frac{d(|\phi|^2)}{dx} = \frac{\hbar k}{m} 2 \phi \phi' dx$.

5112,5112,8131,How do you import members from another system to Wordpress and update passwords so they'll work?,"Our current system ( not using Wordpress ) has 1000s of users that we need to port over to Wordpress. The problem we're running into is that the passwords can't stay the same.

In our current system the passwords are saved with:

md5( md5( $password ) . USER_SALT ); // USER_SALT is a defined constant


Not the best obviously, but not the worst...

We need to make these password hashes that we currently have work in WP as well. Is there a way we can run all new passwords through this setup first and then through WPs own hashing?

I know you can hook into the functions like:

function my_hash_password($password){
    return md5( md5( $password ) . USER_SALT );
}
add_action('wp_hash_password', 'my_hash_password' );


For some reason that's not fully working either.

Surely somebody else has already gone through this before.

Thanks.

EDIT !!!!

So far there is some confusion. I am NOT asking no un-hash the hashed password that we have. What I am saying is that with our current system the passwords look like:

Password:  password
Hash function: md5( md5( $password ) . USER_SALT );
Output: d372f9c033e9c358b111ff265e080d3a


I want to 'maybe' be able to take the hash above and feed it to the native WP password hasher so that:

d372f9c033e9c358b111ff265e080d3a


becomes...

$P$BdrwxndTzgTVHUozGpQ9TEMYd6mpTw0


after it goes through their function.

Then when a user logs in we send their plain text password back through our function and then through WPs to get a match.

UPDATE !!!

So following the advice from rarst below I've done this:

function my_check_password($password, $hash, $user_id = '') {
    global $wp_hasher;
    if ( $hash == md5( md5( $password ) . USER_SALT ) ){
        if ( $user_id ) {
        $check = true;
        wp_set_password($password, $user_id);
        $hash = wp_hash_password($password);
      }
      return apply_filters( 'check_password', $check, $password, $hash, $user_id );
    }

    // If the hash is still md5...
    elseif ( strlen($hash) &lt;= 32 ) {
        $check = hash_equals( $hash, md5( $password ) );
        if ( $check &amp;&amp; $user_id ) {
            // Rehash using new hash.
            wp_set_password($password, $user_id);
            $hash = wp_hash_password($password);
        }
        return apply_filters( 'check_password', $check, $password, $hash, $user_id );
    }

    // If the stored hash is longer than an MD5, presume the
    // new style phpass portable hash.
    if ( empty($wp_hasher) ) {
        require_once( ABSPATH . WPINC . '/class-phpass.php');
        // By default, use the portable hash from phpass
        $wp_hasher = new PasswordHash(8, true);
    }

    $check = $wp_hasher-&gt;CheckPassword($password, $hash);

    return apply_filters( 'check_password', $check, $password, $hash, $user_id );

Does anyone know of a quick way of finding this (if there is even one)? Can I somehow use the relation that:

$$\langle r\rangle ~=~ \frac{a_0}{2}(3n^2 - \ell(\ell+1)),$$ 

or do I just have to brute force and use properties of Laguerre polynomials and spherical harmonics and what not?
",Vallin,https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/15814,"You're confusing the expectation values of the vector $\mathbf{r}=(x,y,z)$ and its magnitude $r=\sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2}$. Because the hydrogen hamiltonian is parity invariant, all its eigenfunctions are chosen to have a definite parity. This means that the expectation value $\langle\mathbf{r}\rangle$ will always be zero because each component is the integral of an odd function times an even probability distribution function.

The second expectation value you mention,
$$\langle n,l,m|r|n,l,m\rangle=\int \mathrm{d}x \mathrm{d}y \mathrm{d}z \psi_{n,l,m}^\ast(x,y,z)\sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2}\psi_{n,l,m}(x,y,z),$$
is quite different, since you're not counting the direction of the distances you add. This is the same as comparing the averages of $x$ and $|x|$ over some 1D probability distribution function $p(x)$. The average of $x$ will be zero if $p(x)$ is even, while the average of $|x|$ will only vanish is $p$ is a delta function, concentrated at the origin. Thus $\langle|x|\rangle$ can be quite large while $\langle x\rangle$ is zero because of cancellations.



This is not to say that expectation values of $\mathbf{r}$ are not interesting, but one must simply be more careful. The fact that the diagonal matrix elements vanish says that the eigenstates have no permanent dipole moment - which of course they can't as they are eigenstates of an isotropic system. What doesn't vanish, however, are the transition matrix elements,
$$\langle n',l',m'|\mathbf{r}|n,l,m\rangle,$$
which play an important role in the hydrogen atom's interaction with radiation. (Specifically, they control the leading-order interaction energy, which is the dipole coupling $-q\mathbf{r}\cdot\mathbf{E}$.) Because the components of $\mathbf{r}$ are themselves spherical harmonics of degree 1 (or linear combinations of them), the matrix element above will involve the spherical integral
$$\int\mathrm{d}\Omega \, Y_{l'm'}^\ast Y_{1,\mu} Y_{lm}$$
for $\mu=-1,0,1$. 

Because the spherical harmonics have a rich orthogonality structure, only a few of these integrals will survive. Specifically, you need $\Delta l=|l-l'|=1$ and $m'=m+\mu$, which has the physical content of the dipole selection rules: for a dipole coupling to radiation, only S-P, P-D, D-F, ... transitions are allowed. Further, only a few spatial orientations are allowed: $m$ can increase or decrease by one (which happens if $|\mu|=1$, and corresponds to circularly polarized light in either direction, with the electric field rotating in the $x,y$ plane) or stay the same (when $m=0$ and the light is linearly polarized along $z$).

","You're confusing the expectation values of the vector $\mathbf{r}=(x,y,z)$ and its magnitude $r=\sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2}$. Because the hydrogen hamiltonian is parity invariant, all its eigenfunctions are chosen to have a definite parity. This means that the expectation value $\langle\mathbf{r}\rangle$ will always be zero because each component is the integral of an odd function times an even probability distribution function.

The second expectation value you mention,
$$\langle n,l,m|r|n,l,m\rangle=\int \mathrm{d}x \mathrm{d}y \mathrm{d}z \psi_{n,l,m}^\ast(x,y,z)\sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2}\psi_{n,l,m}(x,y,z),$$
is quite different, since you're not counting the direction of the distances you add. This is the same as comparing the averages of $x$ and $|x|$ over some 1D probability distribution function $p(x)$. The average of $x$ will be zero if $p(x)$ is even, while the average of $|x|$ will only vanish is $p$ is a delta function, concentrated at the origin. Thus $\langle|x|\rangle$ can be quite large while $\langle x\rangle$ is zero because of cancellations.



This is not to say that expectation values of $\mathbf{r}$ are not interesting, but one must simply be more careful. The fact that the diagonal matrix elements vanish says that the eigenstates have no permanent dipole moment - which of course they can't as they are eigenstates of an isotropic system. What doesn't vanish, however, are the transition matrix elements,
$$\langle n',l',m'|\mathbf{r}|n,l,m\rangle,$$
which play an important role in the hydrogen atom's interaction with radiation. (Specifically, they control the leading-order interaction energy, which is the dipole coupling $-q\mathbf{r}\cdot\mathbf{E}$.) Because the components of $\mathbf{r}$ are themselves spherical harmonics of degree 1 (or linear combinations of them), the matrix element above will involve the spherical integral
$$\int\mathrm{d}\Omega \, Y_{l'm'}^\ast Y_{1,\mu} Y_{lm}$$
for $\mu=-1,0,1$. 

Because the spherical harmonics have a rich orthogonality structure, only a few of these integrals will survive. Specifically, you need $\Delta l=|l-l'|=1$ and $m'=m+\mu$, which has the physical content of the dipole selection rules: for a dipole coupling to radiation, only S-P, P-D, D-F, ... transitions are allowed. Further, only a few spatial orientations are allowed: $m$ can increase or decrease by one (which happens if $|\mu|=1$, and corresponds to circularly polarized light in either direction, with the electric field rotating in the $x,y$ plane) or stay the same (when $m=0$ and the light is linearly polarized along $z$).

Then it's just flare caused by shooting into a lightsource. Concert lights tend to produce strong flaring effects as they are very focussed.

Lens flare is caused by non-image light which does not pass (refract) directly along its intended path, but instead reflects internally on lens elements any number of times (back and forth) before finally reaching the film or digital sensor



A good lens hood can nearly eliminate flare caused by stray light from outside the angle of view. Ensure that this hood has a completely non-reflective inner surface, such as felt, and that there are no regions which have rubbed off. Although using a lens hood may appear to be a simple solution, in reality most lens hoods do not extend far enough to block all stray light. This is particularly problematic when using 35 mm lenses on a digital SLR camera with a ""crop factor,"" because these lens hoods were made for the greater angle of view. In addition, hoods for zoom lenses can only be designed to block all stray light at the widest focal length.

Petal lens hoods often protect better than non-petal (round) types. This is because petal-style hoods take into account the aspect ratio of the camera's film or digital sensor, and so the angle of view is greater in one direction than the other.Placing a hand or piece of paper exterior to the side of the lens which is nearest the flare-inducing light source can also mimic the effect of a proper lens hood. 

Lens flare also depends on the lens used - fixed focal length (or prime) lenses are less susceptible to lens flare than zoom lenses. Other than having an inadequate lens hood at all focal lengths, more complicated zoom lenses often have to contain more lens elements. Zoom lenses therefore have more internal surfaces from which light can reflect.

",Furious,https://cooking.stackexchange.com/users/22612,"Assuming plain (American) white rice on a stovetop:

(Generally, American rice does not need rinsing for these applications)

From your description, it sounds like you are going for Steamed Rice; for that, here's what you want to do:

Bring your water, salt and butter to a boil, then add your rice. Stir it until it comes back to a boil. As soon as it boils again, turn your heat way down. Keep stirring until the heat is low enough that you feel safe that you can cover the pot without it hard boiling again. Cover and keep on low to medium-low heat or a moderate simmer (preferably without peeking) for 20 minutes (15 minimum). It is the steam that plumps the rice, so don't lift the lid! It may take some tweaking depending upon your specific equipment, but try to be patient. You may find that you like a little less water and a bit more time. When you do peek (hopefully after at least 15-20 minutes have passed) look for the water to be gone and for little holes or ""divots"" to be formed on the surface of the rice. If you still have water, cover again and keep cooking without lifting the lid for at least 5 more minutes. When it looks done, turn off the heat but still don't stir, you're better off just letting it sit for another 5 minutes - re-covered and with the heat turned off, then stir/fluff it.

If you find that your rice isn't done after 20-25 minutes with the lid on, bring up the heat a bit, but be careful. If your heat is too high, your rice can burn on the bottom. Within reason, if it's just a bit too low, it'll just take longer.

The lid is really key here. Do you have a tight lid for the pan that you are using? If not, we can help you improvise.

A slightly different method using the same ingredients is the Pilaf Method shown here in a great video from the love of my life, Alton Brown. 20 Minute Pilaf See the rice just before he fluffs it with chopsticks? Those are the holes/divots I referred to above in the explanation of the steaming method. In case the link goes bad, here's a description of the video: Bring 3 cups of water to a rolling boil. Meanwhile, in a saucepan with a tight lid, melt and lightly brown 2 Tbs of butter over high heat. Add 2 cups of rice (regular long grain, basmati or jasmine recommended) and saute for a couple of minutes, add 1 tsp salt (Alton uses kosher). When the rice smells ""nutty"" add the boiling water all at once (careful, it will boil rather violently). Cover and turn heat to low. No peeking, cook on low for 15 minutes. Fluff with chopsticks or a fork. Cover again for 5 minutes, no heat.

Note that Alton's pilaf also requires a tight fitting lid. If your lid isn't tight, try using aluminum foil to get a tighter seal.

Finally: With very small variations, these two methods of cooking rice will work fine for just about any type of rice. Some rice, particularly some rice harvested outside of the US should be thoroughly rinsed first. Check your label if you can or revisit this question if you're not sure if your rice should be rinsed. If you use rinsed rice you may find that you want to use slightly less water for cooking than instructed here.

You're using a 2 to 1 ratio for steaming rice, that's fairly typical but you might like a bit less water, just don't go lower than 1.5 to 1. 

Brown rice works fine for these methods too but will take longer and require slightly more water.

The steaming method, particularly if you wait to ""fluff"" will produce a stickier rice, better for chopsticks :) and better to accompany food that has a sauce you want the rice to soak up. I prefer steamed rice to go with stir-fries, for example.

The pilaf method, particularly with medium to long grained rice will produce more individual grains. Nice with steak or baked chicken, something that isn't sauced.

4166,4166,6638,Make the compare list work without filling the log_* tables?,"The Magento compare list feature only works, when the log_* tables are being filled.

Removing this makes the compare list work right away. The question is, is there a workaround for that? Is there a way to make the compare list work and not fill the log_* tables?

Thanks!
",user1638055,https://magento.stackexchange.com/users/5479,"Sadly the compare items are tightly linked to the visitor information.

The table catalog_compare_item has a column for visitor_id which when you disable the observers mentioned in your question, is set to 0 and so all visitors can see these items.

When you add an item to the compare list the visitor is linked into that item.

Mage_Catalog_Model_Product_Compare_List::addProduct calls the protected function _addVisitorToItem which gets the visitor id set from the log/visitor and attaches this to the item, as well as the customer id when you are logged in.

protected function _addVisitorToItem($item)
{
    $item-&gt;addVisitorId(Mage::getSingleton('log/visitor')-&gt;getId());
    if (Mage::getSingleton('customer/session')-&gt;isLoggedIn()) {
        $item-&gt;addCustomerData(Mage::getSingleton('customer/session')-&gt;getCustomer());
    }

    return $this;

I disabled (and cant enable) this feature by putting this in my local.xml:

&lt;controller_action_predispatch&gt;

Removing this makes the compare list work right away. The question is, is there a workaround for that? Is there a way to make the compare list work and not fill the log_* tables?

Thanks!
","Sadly the compare items are tightly linked to the visitor information.

The table catalog_compare_item has a column for visitor_id which when you disable the observers mentioned in your question, is set to 0 and so all visitors can see these items.

When you add an item to the compare list the visitor is linked into that item.

Mage_Catalog_Model_Product_Compare_List::addProduct calls the protected function _addVisitorToItem which gets the visitor id set from the log/visitor and attaches this to the item, as well as the customer id when you are logged in.

protected function _addVisitorToItem($item)
{
    $item-&gt;addVisitorId(Mage::getSingleton('log/visitor')-&gt;getId());
    if (Mage::getSingleton('customer/session')-&gt;isLoggedIn()) {
        $item-&gt;addCustomerData(Mage::getSingleton('customer/session')-&gt;getCustomer());
    }

    return $this;
}

Company belong_to Owners  (:through => User)
Owner has_one Company

---A company can have multiple owners but one user can own just one company. He can't be owner of multiple companies.

---A user may or may not be owner of a company but always belong to some company.
---A user cannot be part of two companies.
Project has_one Project_manager  (:through => User)
Project_manager belongs_to Projects

---A Project can have just one Project_manager but one can be project manager of multiple projects.


I am not able to figure out how the relationship should be defined in the Models. Also what should be the table structure for all three models.

My objective is to achieve :


Company.Owners

It can be done by : 

@owner = User.find(Company.owner_id) 
Project.Project_manager

It can be done by : 

@Project_manager = User.find(Project.project_manager_id)


But don't want it that way to work !!

Rest is working perfectly fine for me.

335,335,535,Do the online LaTeX compilers use a TeX daemon to speed up their compilation?,"There seem to be quite a few fabulous web-sites now that compile LaTeX online.

I was wondering what techniques these sites used to speed up compilation of documents. It would seem they would be particularly interested in reducing the CPU load from loading the compiler, especially as many of the documents they would be asked to create would be relatively small.

In my experience it seems like the ordinary process for creating a relatively small document with LaTeX, especially XeLaTeX, seems to take a substantial amount of time starting the compiler (e.g. a couple seconds), and a relatively very modest amount of time running it (a few milliseconds).

It would seem then that one could gain tremendous improvements in performance  for relatively small documents by running (PDF/Xe)LaTeX as a daemon that produced a number of documents without having to restart the process.

Others seem to have tried this, and it has been discussed (also) on Tex.SE before. The techniques seem to be somewhat dated, and in any case I couldn't get them to work on Linux with XeLaTeX (which just happens to be what I'm using).

Are any of the online compilers using a sort of TeX daemon to compile their documents in the background? Are there any other recent developments in this area? I happen to be personally interested in the XeLaTeX on Linux, but I would love to know more about what is happening in the LaTeX performance area.

There also seems to be quite a bit of discussion about pre-compilation (as seen under eg performance), but I tried it and the benefits do not seem to be as great as that of daemonizing the process (though I would stand to be proven correct!).

Are there other techniques these online services may be using to improve the response time of compilation?
",Brian M. Hunt,https://tex.stackexchange.com/users/1744,"I don't know the techniques they use, however, I may be able to shed some light from a general systems viewpoint:

First and formost, pdflatex is a CPU-bound program (see Tips for choosing hardware for best LaTeX compile performance). On any modern operating system and hardware it should take less than a couple of milliseconds to start it inside a new process and this startup time should be insignificant in relation to the computational work done for the typesetting. Hence, even in a massive multi-user setting, the benefits of running it inside a preloaded daemon would be relatively small. 

Most disk IO is related to a restricted set of files (the standard classes and packages), which therefore will reside in the buffer cache. However, on a standard server today, it would even be not a problem to cache all TexLive packages and fonts (hey, this are just a few GiB). 

If hundreds or thousands of program instances run in parallel, their memory working sets would furthermore share large parts of the physical memory. Basically, all non-volatile memory (program code, constant data) is shared among all pdflatex processes. Under the hood, the operating system initially ""shares everything"" and transparently creates a private copy of each memory page only when a process attempts to write to it.

I was wondering what techniques these sites used to speed up compilation of documents. It would seem they would be particularly interested in reducing the CPU load from loading the compiler, especially as many of the documents they would be asked to create would be relatively small.

In my experience it seems like the ordinary process for creating a relatively small document with LaTeX, especially XeLaTeX, seems to take a substantial amount of time starting the compiler (e.g. a couple seconds), and a relatively very modest amount of time running it (a few milliseconds).

It would seem then that one could gain tremendous improvements in performance  for relatively small documents by running (PDF/Xe)LaTeX as a daemon that produced a number of documents without having to restart the process.

Others seem to have tried this, and it has been discussed (also) on Tex.SE before. The techniques seem to be somewhat dated, and in any case I couldn't get them to work on Linux with XeLaTeX (which just happens to be what I'm using).

Are any of the online compilers using a sort of TeX daemon to compile their documents in the background? Are there any other recent developments in this area? I happen to be personally interested in the XeLaTeX on Linux, but I would love to know more about what is happening in the LaTeX performance area.

There also seems to be quite a bit of discussion about pre-compilation (as seen under eg performance), but I tried it and the benefits do not seem to be as great as that of daemonizing the process (though I would stand to be proven correct!).

Are there other techniques these online services may be using to improve the response time of compilation?
","I don't know the techniques they use, however, I may be able to shed some light from a general systems viewpoint:

First and formost, pdflatex is a CPU-bound program (see Tips for choosing hardware for best LaTeX compile performance). On any modern operating system and hardware it should take less than a couple of milliseconds to start it inside a new process and this startup time should be insignificant in relation to the computational work done for the typesetting. Hence, even in a massive multi-user setting, the benefits of running it inside a preloaded daemon would be relatively small. 

Most disk IO is related to a restricted set of files (the standard classes and packages), which therefore will reside in the buffer cache. However, on a standard server today, it would even be not a problem to cache all TexLive packages and fonts (hey, this are just a few GiB). 

If hundreds or thousands of program instances run in parallel, their memory working sets would furthermore share large parts of the physical memory. Basically, all non-volatile memory (program code, constant data) is shared among all pdflatex processes. Under the hood, the operating system initially ""shares everything"" and transparently creates a private copy of each memory page only when a process attempts to write to it. So memory that is never written remains always shared.

To sum up: Given a modern hardware and operating-system environment, I would not expect signficant benefits by the daemon approach.

1441,1441,2270,Can the socket in my recessed light be replaced without replacing the entire framing kit?,"I have recessed lighting in my living room.  One of the bulbs went out.  I tried replacing it with a fresh one, but no luck.  There is electricity flowing to the socket, but the socket appears to have gone bad.

I bought a replacement socket at Home Depot, but upon disassembling the light, I realized that I might not be able to replace the socket alone.

I have a Lightolier Lytecaster 1102 Frame-In-Kit.  Details here:

http://www.lightolier.com/MKACatpdfs/1102D1.PDF

Here are photos of the enclosure:



And how the socket is fastened: 



SOLVED: See Dan's answer below. I don't know how I missed it, but inside the socket there are screws.  The socket is not riveted to the enclosure.  Alas, I did have to buy the whole Frame-in-Kit to get the correct socket, but at least I didn't have to remove the entire frame from the ceiling.  I just unscrewed the socket and screwed in the new one.
",Rob Sobers,https://diy.stackexchange.com/users/167,"I've done it twice, in 2008 and just now.  Several problems:  1) old socket is riveted; 2) tight space to rewire.

I drilled the old socket out (through the rivet).

Next cut off any remaining rivet bur for a smooth flat surface.

Buy a replacement ceramic socket for a ceiling light.  The one I bought had both black and white wires attached to the socket and a few inches of wire to work with.  This is better than a replacement socket without the lead wires as it is very difficult to attach the black and white wire coming out of the pot to the replacement socket.  

Detach the mounting bracket that allows you to screw the socket onto a threaded post.  You don't want it because it will bring your socket down an inch or so and you wont get your end cap back on the fixture.

That mounting bracket was secured by a small screw.  Find a larger sheet metal screw narrow enough to go throw that hole. Also make sure the head of the screw is small enough to fit in the recess area of the replacement fixture.

Drill a hole into the top of the ceiling pot, the right size to securely hold the screw.  When I just recently removed my socket there was a black circular washer spacer attached to the top of the pot used as a buffer against the old socket.  There was a center rivet (which I had cut out) but at 12, 3, 6, and 9 o'clock positions there remained marks (I guess from the four screw hold openings of the old socket).  One of these had been drilled but it was too big for my new screw.  So I drilled a smaller hole in another position.

Secure the socket with the new screw.

There is only one place for this new screw so it will make for a lopsided attachment.  That is the socket wanted to lean towards the side where it was attached by the screw.  To solve this I added three tiny washers to the top side of the screw.  This way the socket was not leveraged to that end when tightened.  Plus if I wanted to position it back a little the other way I could.

1273,1273,2004,Is it worth bringing a flash for a backpacking trip?,"I'm going on my honeymoon to Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam in June for 4 weeks.

I'll bring my Canon t3i + 15-55mm and a 55-250mm lens.

This will be my first travel like this and I definitely want to take some awesome pictures.

I don't have a Flash and I want to buy a Canon Speedlite 430EX when the time comes.

The question is... Is it Worth it to buy this flash for this kind of travel?
",Roberto,https://photo.stackexchange.com/users/16030,"The answer, as usual, is ""it depends"".  It depends on what kind of shots you hope to get, and how you plan to use your camera. Flash is beneficial for shots where there is not enough ambient light and the area to be lit is fairly small. It is also very useful when you need fill or to overcome extremely backlit subjects, such as when you must face the sun or a very bright window.

Flash can be useful indoors, in churches, museums and other such places. However, a flash will do very little to light an entire church, but might be useful for a statue or a few elements of detail you wish to capture. However, many places forbid flashes, as the cumulative light damages artifacts and artwork. So, instead of a flash for indoor travel photography, you would be better off with a tripod, and simply setting the camera on a slower shutter speed to capture your subject.

For fill light, a flash is really useful. Luckily, you have a built-in flash on your t3i, and this works reasonably well for fill. However, it is likely that the 55-250 lens might be long enough to block some of the flash. The 430EX will provide more light, and throw it further than your on-board, and it is positioned higher, so it will likely clear the lens. It also offers a separate focus light, that really aids in getting focus in low light situations. But frankly, a pocket flashlight, shining on your subject during focus does the same.  For fill light, a reflector is a must have, but any white object for reflecting works well in a pinch: t-shirt, magazine, piece of paper.

So, my recommendation is that for travel photography, forget the flash. Buy a tripod instead, put a small flashlight in your pocket, and carry something to use as a reflector.

This is a separate value. For example - the hospital called ""St. James Hospital"" has the id of ""3"" in a separate field. How do I do this using a query rather than manually going through a whole database? 
example here
",user2199734,https://stackoverflow.com/users/2199734,"After examining your ACCDB file, I suggest you consider setting up the tables differently.  

Table Health_Professionals:



ID First Name Second Name Position hospital_id
1  John       Doe         PI                 2
2  Joe        Smith       Co-PI              1
3  Sarah      Johnson     Nurse              3


Table Hospitals:

hospital_id Hospital
          1 Beaumont
          2 St James
          3 Letterkenny Hosptial


A key point is to avoid storing both the hospital ID and name in the Health_Professionals table.  Store only the ID.  When you need to see the name, use the hospital ID to join with the Hospitals table and get the name from there.

A useful side effect of this design is that if anyone ever misspells a hospital name, eg ""Hosptial"", you need correct that error in only one place.  Same holds true whenever a hospital is intentionally renamed.

Based on those tables, the query below returns this result set.

ID Second Name First Name Position hospital_id Hospital
1  Doe         John       PI                 2 St James
3  Johnson     Sarah      Nurse              3 Letterkenny Hosptial

Table Health_Professionals:

Table Hospitals:

hospital_id Hospital
          1 Beaumont
          2 St James
          3 Letterkenny Hosptial


A key point is to avoid storing both the hospital ID and name in the Health_Professionals table.  Store only the ID.  When you need to see the name, use the hospital ID to join with the Hospitals table and get the name from there.

A useful side effect of this design is that if anyone ever misspells a hospital name, eg ""Hosptial"", you need correct that error in only one place.  Same holds true whenever a hospital is intentionally renamed.

Based on those tables, the query below returns this result set.

However, if you cast using your other class's slot, then it will be at the slot level you choose to burn.

You can use either class to cast the spell provided that the spell is low enough level to fit in the slot used (you can't cast a 6th level spell in a 3rd level warlock slot).

To answer your specific example: 

You can cast your arcane trickster spells with your warlock slots, they would be cast at 3rd level. However, if you try to cast a warlock spell using your arcane trickster slots, they will be cast at the level of the slot you use. Also, you can't cast a higher level spell than slot you have remaining (can't cast a 3rd level warlock spell in a 1st level AT slot).

2215,2215,3529,Would a meta-answer be a good idea?,"One of the stated goals of the site was the have one comprehensive answer to each question. I think we can definitively say that it hasn't worked out that way. I think the reason is reputation. If one person answer the question with 40% of the information that a comprehensive answer would contain, and another with another 40% with 20% scattered among three other answers. Who's answer will get edited with the combined information and get the further upvotes? It just doesn't happen. People don't want to edit questions and mess with someone else's reputation (quite rightly, IMO - how would you feel getting a downvote for something added to your answer that you didn't write?).

One idea to get towards that goal would be to have a community answer on each question, with say a small reputation bump (2 points?) for participating in making it. To prevent reputation inflation, you can only get the 2 points from a given question one time, with a daily limit (say 10 points) for doing it on questions asked by others.

Then when the question is seen for posterity, it will be the first answer.

The issue is what to do with the accepted answer? One possibility is to only open the community answer once there is an accepted answer and pre-fill it with that answer.

Does any of this make sense to anyone else?

So allowing moderators to establish a single 'meta-answer' for such question would provide a way to merge duplicate and similar answers into one comprehensive (and comprehensible) whole.

You were not allowed into the Temple unless you were Tahor.
You could not touch Terumah and Challah (the tithing and piece of dough given to a Cohen) unless you were Tahor. Otherwise they became impure and had to be burned. Nowadays we burn them, as we are all considered impure.

",Jishnu U Nair,https://unix.stackexchange.com/users/58138,"Answering the second part of your question, the ""best"" way to watch for filesystem changes is by using inotify(7). 

There is a set of utilities that can hook into the kernel interface, inotify-tools. In particular, you want inotifywait from that set of utilities:


  inotifywait efficiently waits for changes to files using Linux's inotify(7) interface. It is suitable for waiting for changes to files from shell scripts. It can either exit once an event occurs, or continually execute and output events as they occur.


You could use it like this:

#!/bin/sh
while inotifywait -e create /share/capture/*/; do
  /share/capture/per.sh
done


You script will only then be called when a new file is created. I did not test the example - I adapted it from the manual page, so please adapt as needed.

The error is solved, but the script tends to delete all files instead of just deleting enough to take usage percentage down to limit. Am I still doing something wrong?
","Answering the second part of your question, the ""best"" way to watch for filesystem changes is by using inotify(7). 

There is a set of utilities that can hook into the kernel interface, inotify-tools. In particular, you want inotifywait from that set of utilities:


  inotifywait efficiently waits for changes to files using Linux's inotify(7) interface. It is suitable for waiting for changes to files from shell scripts. It can either exit once an event occurs, or continually execute and output events as they occur.


You could use it like this:

#!/bin/sh
while inotifywait -e create /share/capture/*/; do
  /share/capture/per.sh
done


You script will only then be called when a new file is created. I did not test the example - I adapted it from the manual page, so please adapt as needed.

1907,1907,3039,Is it possible to create a non-ecommerce site using Magento,"I have a site to develop. This site is a kind of voucher code site.

  If $N$ is smooth manifolds and $F: M \to N$ is a smooth map, for each $p \in M$ we define a map $F_*: T_pM \to T_{F(p)}N$, called the push-forward associated with $F$, by

3412,3412,5434,When should I use archaic and obsolete words?,"I'm learning the English language, and while reading Merriam-Webster I often see common words with additional ""obsolete"" and ""archaic"" descriptions added to their definitions. 

When should I use them, should I use them at all, and what's the difference between these descriptions? Also, should I spend time to remember these archaic and obsolete meanings? 
",Daniel Ganiev,https://english.stackexchange.com/users/722,"Archaic means that a word has the flavor of old-timey language, and brings the feel of the past along with it. Archaic language is generally used infrequently and for effect when it is. I think that in English-speaking countries, the most common uses of archaic language are when religious texts are being quoted, or when older literature is being quoted--or performed, as in the case of Shakespeare or other period plays. Here's a fuller definition at Merriam-Webster.

Obsolete is a cousin of sorts to the word ""archaic"", and using an obsolete word will certainly make what you're saying seem esoteric and strange--but an obsolete word is a word that's no longer used at all. One should use such words with extreme caution: people listening to you or reading your writing may not know what you're talking about, unless you very carefully provide good context for them to figure out the meaning of what you're communicating. 

I wouldn't prioritize learning obsolete and archaic words until you get more advanced in English, and I don't think anyone's going to fault you for failing to know archaic words. 

If you want to take a crash course in archaic language, dipping into the plays of William Shakespeare would be a good start, as they are readily available, but prepare to be extremely bewildered! There exist translations of both of these with notes to explain the more perplexing turns of phrase.
