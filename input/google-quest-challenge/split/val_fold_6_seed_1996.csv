So one of the most interesting (from a cognitive dissonance point of view) rewards that players can get is the dungeon itself. They clear out an asteroid full of Nanoinfested Bots?

This is, of course, only of great value if managed correctly, but enterprising players will see the value in rare memes.

1851,1851,2937,How does arbitary code execution work?,"I'm unable to understand how arbitrary code execution vulnerabilities are supposed to work.

Wikipedia mentions:


  Arbitrary code execution is commonly achieved through control over the instruction pointer of a running process.


Say, the vulnerability is being triggered by some maliciously crafted file that said process is reading. How could it modify the instruction pointer, or, otherwise, corrupt the internal state of the application so as to cause it to execute the attacker's code?

Also, given that modern OSes implement DEP and ASLR, how is this even feasible? The data loaded from the application would not even be executable, and additionally, it's also difficult to determine the offset of the shellcode/payload.

Brownie points for showing a small snippet of code that would be vulnerable to such an exploit.
",user2064000,https://security.stackexchange.com/users/22260,"Each vulnerability has a specific cause, which in turn leads to ways of exploiting the vulnerability. It is hard to understand how one can exploit something abstract and gain some abstract results, but it is way easier to understand when illustrated with examples. The simplest would be the classical stack-based buffer overflow:

void f(const char *str) {
  char buf[10];
  strcpy(buf, str);
}


This is a primitive example that should be sufficient to demonstrate the issue. Suppose the str argument points to a NULL-terminated string longer than the 10 chars allocated for the variable it is being copied into. What will happen? strcpy() will blindly copy the date over the end of the buffer, overwriting whatever was there. But what exactly is there?

On x86, for example, the buf variable would be allocated on the stack. The stack is also used to save the return address when a CALL instruction is executed. So (simplified) stack layout would look like this (addresses are increasing top to bottom):

...
buf[0..3]
buf[4..7]
buf[8..9]
return address
...


So, by supplying an overly long string via the str argument, we would be able to overwrite the return address from f(). If the attacker is able to control the string, then he can control where the control flow will go after f() returns. This may occur when parsing a specially crafted file, for example.

The next thing would be to direct the control to a JMP ESP instruction or similar in effect, causing code from the stack to be executed. This ""direct"" code execution is prevented by DEP.

Of course, the example above doesn't include bypassing any of modern mitigations (stack canaries, SafeSEH, DEP). This does not mean it is globally impossible, but it may be impossible in certain cases. Bypassing DEP usually involves Return-oriented programming -- instead of code itself, specially crafted data is placed on the stack, which utilises fragments of already existing functions in the process image (called gadgets) to execute code. This, in turn, is mitigated by ASLR, making the gadget addresses somewhat unpredictable. There are techniques of bypassing ASLR as well.

If you would like to get your hands on exploiting real-life programs, I would suggest corelanc0d3r's tutorials as a starting point.

Your code has way too many comments, mostly redundant ones - some are even obsolete!

Good comments should say why, not what.


// Create our new excel application and add our workbooks/worksheets
Workbooks workbooks = xls.Workbooks;
Workbook workbook = workbooks.Add();



This comment says what the code is doing, and it's lying - you're not creating a new Excel application, you're using an existing instance. Remove it.


// Hide our excel object if it's visible.
xls.Visible = false;



This comment adds no value, and is lying to a certain extent: you don't actually care whether it's already visible or not. Better just remove it.


// Turn off calculations if set to automatic; this can help prevent memory leaks.
xls.Calculation = xls.Calculation == XlCalculation.xlCalculationAutomatic ? XlCalculation.xlCalculationManual : XlCalculation.xlCalculationManual;



This one is accurate and informative - it says why you're turning off automatic calculations.. but it also says what the code is doing. Better rephrase it:

// turning off automatic calculations improves performance and can help prevent memory leaks.
xls.Calculation = (xls.Calculation == XlCalculation.xlCalculationAutomatic) 
                                    ? XlCalculation.xlCalculationManual 
                                    : XlCalculation.xlCalculationManual;


Notice how readability is improved by splitting the ternary operation into 3 lines. It appears the condition is moot, since both ends produce the same assignation. The instruction should be rewritten as simply:

xls.Calculation = XlCalculation.xlCalculationManual;



// Turn off screen updating so our export will process more quickly.
xls.ScreenUpdating = false;



Again, says what - the why makes it closely related to the previous statement. Thus:

// turning off automatic calculations and screen updating 
// improves performance and can help prevent memory leaks.
xls.Calculation = XlCalculation.xlCalculationManual;
xls.ScreenUpdating = false;



// Create an excel table and fill it will our query table.



Remove. This one adds no value.

Apparently the code under that comment was moved, but the comment remained.



As for performance, @Will's comment is accurate - COM interop is hurting you here. What's slowing it down is the many calls to the Excel object model (COM interop in itself incurs a performance penalty, but Excel interop somehow makes it even worse). The only way is to limit the number of times you're accessing the Excel object model.

An alternative approach could be to write the data in a .csv file, and use the Excel object model to import the .csv data all in one shot (rather than looping into rows and columns to write the data ""manually""), and then to format the workbook and save it in .xlsx format.

The problem I am having is that it's pretty slow, like 5 seconds a sheet. It was my understanding that using a for loop when creating the tables was ideal, but the issue seems to be with tables containing over a thousand or so records... still wouldn't think it should take this long.

Any pointers would be appreciated, also, if I am completely left field with this code let me know, up-to-date Excel code resources seem to be hard to find.

","Comments

Your code has way too many comments, mostly redundant ones - some are even obsolete!

Good comments should say why, not what.


// Create our new excel application and add our workbooks/worksheets
Workbooks workbooks = xls.Workbooks;
Workbook workbook = workbooks.Add();



This comment says what the code is doing, and it's lying - you're not creating a new Excel application, you're using an existing instance. Remove it.


// Hide our excel object if it's visible.
xls.Visible = false;



This comment adds no value, and is lying to a certain extent: you don't actually care whether it's already visible or not. Better just remove it.


// Turn off calculations if set to automatic; this can help prevent memory leaks.
xls.Calculation = xls.Calculation == XlCalculation.xlCalculationAutomatic ? XlCalculation.xlCalculationManual : XlCalculation.xlCalculationManual;



This one is accurate and informative - it says why you're turning off automatic calculations.. but it also says what the code is doing. Better rephrase it:

// turning off automatic calculations improves performance and can help prevent memory leaks.
xls.Calculation = (xls.Calculation == XlCalculation.xlCalculationAutomatic) 
                                    ? XlCalculation.xlCalculationManual 
                                    : XlCalculation.xlCalculationManual;


Notice how readability is improved by splitting the ternary operation into 3 lines. It appears the condition is moot, since both ends produce the same assignation. The instruction should be rewritten as simply:

xls.Calculation = XlCalculation.xlCalculationManual;



// Turn off screen updating so our export will process more quickly.
xls.ScreenUpdating = false;



Again, says what - the why makes it closely related to the previous statement. Thus:

// turning off automatic calculations and screen updating 
// improves performance and can help prevent memory leaks.
xls.Calculation = XlCalculation.xlCalculationManual;
xls.ScreenUpdating = false;



// Create an excel table and fill it will our query table.



Remove. This one adds no value.


for (int i = 0; i &lt;= iterator; i++)
{
    // Turn off calculations if set to automatic; this can help prevent memory leaks.
    Worksheet worksheet = (Worksheet)xls.Worksheets[i + 1];
    worksheet.Name = excelWorksheetName[i];
    worksheet.Select();

4951,4951,7885,How can I use an SVG image as a map marker in OpenLayers-3?,"I am trying to create map ""pin-drops"" (ie. map markers) in OpenLayers-3 (OL3) using SVG images.

Currently, I am using PNG images as the pindrops that reference the ol.style.Icon source (“src”) property attribute just fine. However, this fails using an SVG image. Is there some other way to use an SVG in the same manner? Maybe by using a reference besides ol.style.Icon even? There is already a lot of built-in SVG in Open Layers so this should be possible, but I haven't found a way to get this working in OL3. Is there some other way to do this in OL3 that I should consider?

Please note: we already tried using an ol.Vector layer, however when the user zooms in/out, the size of the SVG image grows/shrinks which is an inadequate workaround.



OL3 (fails): 

var createMapMarkerImage = function() {
    return function(feature, resolution) {
        var iconStyle = new ol.style.Style({
            image: new ol.style.Icon( ({
                src: 'img/map_pindrop.svg'   // OL3 doesn’t like this, but accepts a .PNG just fine
            }))
        });
        return [iconStyle];
    };
};


Very similar functionality, is the below example I found online, is almost perfect if it weren’t for the fact that the example uses OpenLayers-2 (OL2) functionality which calls openlayers.js library (instead of OL3’s ol.js library). Sadly, swapping these javascript files out fails.

In fact my problem is that in my document there is an issue with the numbering of the boxes: in some chapters the numbering jump, e.g. Box 3.1, Box 3.2 and (!) Box 3.4, skipping 3.3...
","I'm not sure if the problem is skipping some values or setting them. This answer can help in the first case.

If you just want to skip one value, next code shows two possibilities: 


\stepcounter outside the box or 
step and label as tcolorbox option. 


If you need to jump more than one value, use \addtocounter before the box.

Remember that the new value will be the base for following boxes.

876,876,1389,Why do people rewrite some libraries to many programming languages?,"There are some libraries, which are available in their versions written in many different programming languages, like for example Lucene, which is written in Java (as they say, 100% pure Java), but has also its versions in C++, C, Perl, Ruby, Lisp and some other languages. And I'm talking about implementations in these languages, not just FFI interfaces.

Why do people do that? I can see one obvious reason: deployment and distribution (and probably development as well) easier when a project has fewer dependencies. But is there anything else? In what situations is it worth it?

For example, I started the Noda Time project as a port of Joda Time.

It is usually more advantageous to go first during the first turn, because you get first race selection. After choosing your race, the new selection is revealed. If your opponent was only allowed a single turn, you could calculate the best move for every race before the revealed race, and determine the best move possible (after the new race is revealed, you can add it's best move into your calculations). If you only played one round, you will get the first attempt to take empty territory, and your opponent might have to attack you to take territory.

The exception to the above would be when a powerful race is revealed. This is less likely to happen when compared to the 6 starting revealed races.

An examination of the last turn is similar. The player who is going first has the opportunity to take any unclaimed regions (if any) before his opponent.

For the most part, this is a game of open information. Going first is an advantage in 2-player, because you could calculate your optimum move and your opponents optimum move that turn. In subsequent turns, you will get the first opportunity to go into decline. The only random events (race selection) favor the first player. In multiplayer though, who each person decides to attack has probably a greater effect on winning. If every player played optimally, I think the first player would still have the advantage most of the time, but that is a much more difficult question to solve.

The exception to the above would be when a powerful race is revealed. This is less likely to happen when compared to the 6 starting revealed races.

An examination of the last turn is similar. The player who is going first has the opportunity to take any unclaimed regions (if any) before his opponent.

For the most part, this is a game of open information. Going first is an advantage in 2-player, because you could calculate your optimum move and your opponents optimum move that turn. In subsequent turns, you will get the first opportunity to go into decline. The only random events (race selection) favor the first player. In multiplayer though, who each person decides to attack has probably a greater effect on winning. If every player played optimally, I think the first player would still have the advantage most of the time, but that is a much more difficult question to solve.

3087,3087,4917,does re-encrypting the same value with multiple keys reduce security,"I found myself wondering today, how much security is lost if you take a plaintext - assume that its content, including any metadata is unknown to an attacker, for example it may be random data - and encrypt it with multiple keys (not chained) and give all resulting ciphertexts to an attacker, how much higher is the probability of an attacker discovering the plaintext, vs only having a single ciphertext.

In addition: take the same plaintext $P_1$ and, and encrypt it with $K_1$, giving $C_1$. Then take $P_1$ and encrypt it with $K_2$ giving $C_2$, then $K_n$ giving $C_n$ and send all $n$ ciphertexts to attacker $A_2$.

",Zack Newsham,https://crypto.stackexchange.com/users/13023,"
  Does re-encrypting the same value with multiple keys reduce security?


The answer is ""it depends""; there are some attack models and encryption methods where the security is reduced, there are other cases where there appears to be no security reduction.

Let us go through some models where we actually see a security reduction:

Plaintext guessing attack and deterministic encryption


In this attack model, the attacker has a guess to the plaintext $P_{guess}$ and wants to confirm whether $P_1 \stackrel{?}{=} P_{guess}$.  What he can do is guess random keys $K_{guess}$ and compute $E_{K_{guess}}(P_{guess})$ and he if that appears in one of the ciphertexts he's been given.  If he happens to guess a key $K_i$, then ciphertext $C_i$ will match, and he will get confirmation that his guess is likely to be correct - that's because we assume that the encryption is deterministic and so if the keys and the plaintext match, the ciphertext will as well.  Obviously, using more keys means that there are more targets the attacker can stumble into.

Deterministic stream ciphers, and plaintext with known linear relations.


Here, we assume we don't know the plaintext, however we do know certain linear relations between the bits of the plaintext; for example, we may know that the parity of each byte is even.  We also assume that the cipher works by generating a keystream (as a function of the key), and then exclusive-or the keystream with the plaintext to form the ciphertext.

So, what the attacker can do is examine each ciphertext; by assuming that the linear relationships hold in the original plaintext, he can evaluate the corresponding linear functions on the keystream; in the example, he can compute the parity of each byte of the keystream.

Then, he can pick random keys, and generate the corresponding keystream (here, we assume that this is determanistic).  Then, he can compute the linear function of that keystream (in the example, the parity of each byte), and see if it matches one of the keystreams that correspond to the known ciphertexts.

Like the first example, having more targets makes it more likely that the attacker will guess the correct key.

(Also, if you think that the example of ""parity of each byte is even"" is contrived, a more realistic example is ""the msbit of each byte is 0"").

Deterministic RSA encryption


If the encrypt the exact same message (without padding, or using determanistic padding) to $n$ different keys, and $n \ge e$ (where $e$ is the common public exponent), then it's easy to recover the message.  This is typically used as an example why you need to add randomness to your RSA encryption, even if you don't care about plaintext guessing attacks.



The above are three examples where encrypting with multiple keys can reduce security; in other cases (such as CBC-mode encryption), there is no obvious way to use multiple ciphertexts.

Now, the obvious thing about all three examples are that they are deterministic encryption; it would appear to be wise to add randomness if you are encrypting with multiple keys.

The site returns to normal immediately after disabling compilation but I'd really like to have the performance benefits. Does anyone know how to fix this?
",David Perry,https://magento.stackexchange.com/users/2075,"It sounds like one of your extensions, or some custom code in your system, is incompatible with Magento's compilation mode.  The exact solution will vary depending on your PHP system.  Here's an explanation of the problem and some troubleshooting tips that should help you.

A file in your system contains a line that looks something like this

//the string 'ConfigFileManager-Model.php' may be 
//a constant or variable as well

require_once 'ConfigFileManager-Model.php';


The file ConfigFileManager-Model.php is not part of Magento, or any publicly distributed package as far as I can tell.    

It sounds like when you're running in ""non-compiled mode"", Magento can find this file without issue.  That means it's somewhere in the normal Magento include paths

/path/to/magento/app/code/core/ConfigFileManager-Model.php    
/path/to/magento/app/code/community/ConfigFileManager-Model.php
/path/to/magento/app/code/local/ConfigFileManager-Model.php
/path/to/magento/path/to/calling/files/own/folder/ConfigFileManager-Model.php

#possibly more, depending on your system's default include path


However, when Magento runs in compiled mode, the core, local, and community code pool paths are not added as include paths.  Only the folder

/path/to/magento/includes/src


is added as an include path.  Additionally, what compilation mode does is make copies of all the class files and drops them into the includes/src folder.  That means the file's own original folder is no longer in the include path.  Because of this, when Magento runs the require code in compilation mode, it can't find the ConfigFileManager-Model.php file, and fails.

The best thing to do would be recode the module and/or custom code such that the functionality of ConfigFileManager-Model.php is incorporated into a standard Magento helper of model class.

The less good, but quicker thing would be to identify all the places ConfigFileManager-Model.php is required and change the path so it's absolute instead of relative.

The site returns to normal immediately after disabling compilation but I'd really like to have the performance benefits. Does anyone know how to fix this?
","It sounds like one of your extensions, or some custom code in your system, is incompatible with Magento's compilation mode.  The exact solution will vary depending on your PHP system.  Here's an explanation of the problem and some troubleshooting tips that should help you.

A file in your system contains a line that looks something like this

//the string 'ConfigFileManager-Model.php' may be 
//a constant or variable as well

require_once 'ConfigFileManager-Model.php';


The file ConfigFileManager-Model.php is not part of Magento, or any publicly distributed package as far as I can tell.    

It sounds like when you're running in ""non-compiled mode"", Magento can find this file without issue.  That means it's somewhere in the normal Magento include paths

/path/to/magento/app/code/core/ConfigFileManager-Model.php    
/path/to/magento/app/code/community/ConfigFileManager-Model.php
/path/to/magento/app/code/local/ConfigFileManager-Model.php
/path/to/magento/path/to/calling/files/own/folder/ConfigFileManager-Model.php

#possibly more, depending on your system's default include path


However, when Magento runs in compiled mode, the core, local, and community code pool paths are not added as include paths.  Only the folder

/path/to/magento/includes/src


is added as an include path.  Additionally, what compilation mode does is make copies of all the class files and drops them into the includes/src folder.  That means the file's own original folder is no longer in the include path.  Because of this, when Magento runs the require code in compilation mode, it can't find the ConfigFileManager-Model.php file, and fails.

The best thing to do would be recode the module and/or custom code such that the functionality of ConfigFileManager-Model.php is incorporated into a standard Magento helper of model class.

The less good, but quicker thing would be to identify all the places ConfigFileManager-Model.php is required and change the path so it's absolute instead of relative.

I don't know where does the majority of the effect come from, but at least we do know that spells are usually required. I suppose that it really depends on the potion you're working on - I don't think a spell is required for all potions.

I think it is clear, then, that it simply sucks for squibs. Which makes sense. This may contribute to explain why is Filch so inefficient identifying potions.

I don't think they explicitly mention whether students were tired or not after their potion classes. They probably were, but that would most likely be because of, uh, studying hard? XD

Brewing that potion takes several weeks/months/whatever. She had plenty of time to rest. I think that this proves that the longer a potion takes to be made, the least exhausting it is, because most of the time it consumes is, well, waiting rather than casting spells on it too frequently. For this kind of potions, the highest requirement would probably be patience and intelligence - Hermione should do fine.

2986,2986,4761,"Are DSLRs a dying breed, making now the time to switch to a mirrorless camera system?","I came across this thought provoking article on Stuck in Customs today that makes a strong case to hold off too much investment in DSLR gear, and instead switch to mirror-less cameras like the Sony NEX. The author prefers to call such cameras 3rd generation cameras to prevent any bias.

The crux of the argument lies in the smaller size and faster shooting speeds of the new cameras, while the sensor size is an area where they seem to be lacking (Sony &amp; Samsung cameras are APS-C sized though). Currently the big makers - Nikon &amp; Canon - have practically no presence in this market (Nikon seems to be doing something with the V1). However, they seem to have slowed down the introduction of new entry level DSLR models over the last year as well.

So, as DSLR users looking to build and enhance their kit (there are many like me who've jumped the bandwagon over the last couple of years, and are just starting to build their kit), what are the advantages of sticking with the DSLR system rather than switching to the 3rd gen cameras?

IMO, one point that could cause a massive switch in the DSLR base would be if Nikon &amp; Canon announced mirror-less models compatible with their current lens lineups, but that is a hypothetical scenario.

P.S. There is a similar question on mirror-less cameras, but that seems to be from the perspective of a person starting out rather than a person already invested in the DSLR system.

The author prefers to call such cameras 3rd generation cameras to prevent any bias.

The crux of the argument lies in the smaller size and faster shooting speeds of the new cameras, while the sensor size is an area where they seem to be lacking (Sony &amp; Samsung cameras are APS-C sized though).

Then the movie switches from ""scary"" to ""romantic"" as she meets the man of her dreams and hooks up with him.  It appears to be a ""they lived happily ever after"" but she has disturbing dreams of the murder and is an artist.  She draws or sketches the beast from the alley.  Eventually she tells her hubby what she promised not to tell and he turns into the beast to destroy her.

",Justin Othername,https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/users/34188,"Since the outlined art consists simply of filled objects, the intuitive solution would be to add an exterior stroke of the weight of half the amount you wanted to increase the initial stroke.

However, some caveats I can think of off the top of my head:


Adding strokes to unjoined outlines will add weight to the ends, while with path stroke behaviour, the stroke is capped at the endpoints by default
It's a lot harder to reduce the weight of the stroke after it's outlined. Luckily, you want only to thicken it, so you don't really have to worry about this.

I constitute our tech department, and unfortunately my experience with coding is quite limited. I have used very basic vba coding in the past, but I dont code that much in my daily job, so I have forgotten most of it.

The louisiana dnr keeps amazing records for every single oil well drilled in the state and all of these records are located at www.Sonris.com. Part of these records are the production records for each well. I would like to create a macro that follows a given url and downloads the table found on the URL (aka the production records). After it downloads the file, I would like it to put the table in a new sheet and then to name this sheet based on the well name. 

I have fooled around with the retrieve data from web function, however I cannot make the function dynamic enough. I need the code to copy the hyperlink data found in a cell. Currently, the code just follows the hyperlink that I copy and paste while recording the macro. 

Any help would be appreciated

The list of WSN identifiers are in the WSNs worksheet starting in column 2. Run the macro by tapping Alt+F8 to open the Macros dialog and Run the Gather_Well_Data macro. When it is complete, you will have a workbook filled with worksheets identified by the WSNs similar to below.

I constitute our tech department, and unfortunately my experience with coding is quite limited. I have used very basic vba coding in the past, but I dont code that much in my daily job, so I have forgotten most of it.

The louisiana dnr keeps amazing records for every single oil well drilled in the state and all of these records are located at www.Sonris.com. Part of these records are the production records for each well. I would like to create a macro that follows a given url and downloads the table found on the URL (aka the production records). After it downloads the file, I would like it to put the table in a new sheet and then to name this sheet based on the well name. 

I have fooled around with the retrieve data from web function, however I cannot make the function dynamic enough. I need the code to copy the hyperlink data found in a cell. Currently, the code just follows the hyperlink that I copy and paste while recording the macro. 

Any help would be appreciated

Sincerely,
Josiah

",user275846,https://askubuntu.com/users/275846,"Okay I got build errors. Haven't got time to test it at the moment :(.

Also: ""After this operation, 1779 MB of additional disk space will be used.""
So make sure you have a few GB's set aside if you're going to do this.



Okay so I got it working by following this: How to install the Pantheon desktop environment? Basically the PPA everyone is suggesting works, is 404-ing for me (and presumably you) when I try and access it.

1) This is syslinux-themes-elementary-isis, and the .sh script apparently requires it. Sudo apt-get didn't find it for me. You could probably test removing this dependency from the .sh if you are feeling bold. I installed amd64 version of this (as I am on 64 bit, if you are on 32 bit obviously don't), just use a .deb installer on Ubuntu:

https://launchpad.net/~elementary-os/+archive/daily/+files/syslinux-themes-elementary-isis_2-0%7E4%7Esaucy1_amd64.deb


2) This is required by the elementary os install script:

sudo apt-get install dctrl-tools dpkg-dev 
    genisoimage gfxboot-theme-ubuntu live-build squashfs-tools syslinux zsync


3) The script uses this to determine what files to download (obviously don't do both, amd64 is for 64bit and i386 is for 32 bit) (you'll want to put this in .bashrc or somewhere else for it to be permanent, not 100% anyone will ever need this again though):

export ARCH=amd64
export ARCH=i386


4) From the previous question/answer thread:

sudo apt-get install bzr
bzr branch lp:elementaryos
cd elementaryos
sudo congrego.sh


On my machine I didn't specify $ARCH so I got 90% of the way through a 970 M .iso file for i386 before I realised -_-.

Currently running through the amd64 installation.



As an aside:

# load config
source etc/congrego.conf

if [[ ""$ARCH"" == ""all"" ]]; then
        $(dirname ""$0"")/bin/download.sh i386
        $(dirname ""$0"")/bin/download.sh amd64
        $(dirname ""$0"")/bin/build.sh i386
        $(dirname ""$0"")/bin/build.sh amd64
        if [[ ""$SOURCEFORGE"" != """" ]]; then
            $(dirname ""$0"")/bin/sourceforge.sh i386
            $(dirname ""$0"")/bin/sourceforge.sh amd64
        fi
else
        $(dirname ""$0"")/bin/download.sh ""$ARCH""
        $(dirname ""$0"")/bin/build.sh ""$ARCH""
        $(dirname ""$0"")/bin/sourceforge.sh ""$ARCH""
fi


It is a bit presumptuous that users would have that environment variable set. Unless I am reading it wrong, it seems like it will download iso's for i386 AND amd64 and then build both of them, which sounds like a bad idea. I'm noob at bash script though so it could be fine for all I know.

Just in case this is irrelevant to your machine:

2054,2054,3274,What is a sci-fi system that would feel familiar to reluctant Pathfinder players?,"For the last few months I've been running a Pathfinder campaign, and recently I told my players that I needed a break and they agreed on switching games for a few months. I'm a fan of the works of Isaac Asimov, Larry Niven and so on, and science fiction would be a great change of pace. So here is my opportunity! At last! Or not?

My problem is my players have never liked anything that isn't D&amp;D or Pathfinder. We're all well into the thirties, and the majority have a taste for long campaigns (they really enjoy character development) and some big differences about what we want in a game. The one player who's also a regular GM has a greater appreciation for new games, but the rest is usually scared off by words like ""indie"", and ""FATE"".

I ran a Traveller campaign years ago using GURPS. They hated GURPS. I took off the GURPS part and added ""Mongoose"". They hated Mongoose. I tried Diaspora. They hate FATE. I talked about Ringworld, but I found BRP is not a good system for sci-fi. Jovian Chronicles? ""It has to be as bad as Tribe 8."" (Their words, not mine). Every time I suggest anything that's not Pathfinder it's the same song.

Though I find Traveller good enough, obviously now it's not an option. My latest reading has been a game based on FUDGE (far enough from FATE) inspired by movies like Alien, Predator and alike. I fear a one-session campaign and new ""hate"". It has to be a game that fits my group. Right?

Of course it may be that there's no such game and I have to deal with my players instead, so ""There is no such game"" is an answer I'll reluctantly accept.
",Cazacurdas,https://rpg.stackexchange.com/users/7885,"The best way is to get buy-in from your players. One way of doing that is giving them a selection of games that you would enjoy and asking them to decide amongst themselves which to play. This leverages a bit of human psychology where we will invest in something more if we have a hand in choosing it, especially if, in the process of choosing it, we ever argue for its merits to a peer. Giving your players a choice of sci-fi games means that the one they pick will have at least a little bit of support from at least some of your players already built-in.

Pick three or four games and present them to your players. Say you're running one of these, but which is up to them. Don't defend the games if they disparage them, just ask them to pick the one they think they'll enjoy the most. (By not allowing them to make you a target of arguments, you prevent them from digging in their heels and deciding preemptively they'll hate it.) If they hate it, well, they chose it. Which specific games you present them is up to you, but if I were doing this and trying hard to keep them all as appealing to dedicated Pathfinder players as possible, I would include at least one of these three if not all of them:


Stars Without Number is based on an older edition of D&amp;D, so it's as close as you will come to the feel of Pathfinder, mechanically, as a science-fiction system can get. As a bonus, it's free, and if your players like it, it's very well supported with for-pay supplements and print books.

As a fan of Traveller, you should find the GM's side of SWN to be pleasantly familiar too. It's built to accommodate a system-hopping game or a campaign that stays on one world, and the ""tags"" system for setting development means you have a constant supply of new ideas at the roll of a die. It will work for a one-shot as well as Pathfinder would – possibly better, because new characters are not quite as complicated, and it gives you tools for quickly ""statting up"" a world.
Thousand Suns is exactly aimed at re-creating the genre of Isaac Aasimov, Niven, Pournelle, and their kindred in classic science fiction. Written by a luminary of classic D&amp;D blogging, James Maliszewski of Grognardia, it's a straightforward system that still has its roots in D&amp;D, so it doesn't ask players coming from a d20 background to make a paradigm shift in ""how RPGs work"" like Fate does, and it doesn't have the explosion of complexity (compared to d20) that GURPS or BRP does. It has stats with unfamiliar names but familiar function, and a skill system that should feel familiar enough to them.
d20 Future is going to be very familiar to your players. It's a bit more generic in that it's aimed at creating all kinds of sci-fi, not just the sort written by the authors you mention, but it will do the job. Being a supplement to d20 Modern it does require more books, but the breadth of character options will probably be welcome to your players, since lots of ""chunky"" character build options (as opposed to the fine-grained ones of GURPS, et. al.) is one of the big draws of d20 for its dedicated fans. d20 Future and Modern both have SRDs online, which somewhat makes up for the extra materials you need by making them free.


I strongly suggestion one of those, but the most important part is to give them a shortlist of games you're willing to run and then make the decision theirs. They've already agreed to a change of game, and it's only for a short time, so they should at least be able to agree on one they think they won't hate.

And if they do hate it, all is not lost: you've played a bit of a game you want to play, and you've burned only one of thousands of games that you could try. Really, you could keep trying one-shots of strange new games regularly, and it would take you decades to go through even a fraction of the RPGs currently published, and there are more every year; so don't worry too much if they hate it. Enjoy it yourself, and give them some agency in the choice, and it will all turn out in the end.

@1X is a resolution (or rather, a process) in which many designers still design apps. Why? Because (and as many would have to agree) designing at such is much more tangible. I find it hard to explain why it’s so, but all I can say is that the content feels much more 1 on 1, it feels right so to speak, and the design is much more flexible to deal with, because of our “low” resolution computer displays that we’re designing them on.
Though that doesn’t mean we all like designing @1X. I’ve seen many others who build wonderful, beautiful apps designing at both processes (the other would have to be @2X — resolution of that of the Retina Display) and some say it feels much more comfortable for them having to have their content match perfectly without having to scale things up and tweak things around on the display.

2395,2395,3824,"Are DSLRs a dying breed, making now the time to switch to a mirrorless camera system?","I came across this thought provoking article on Stuck in Customs today that makes a strong case to hold off too much investment in DSLR gear, and instead switch to mirror-less cameras like the Sony NEX. The author prefers to call such cameras 3rd generation cameras to prevent any bias.

The crux of the argument lies in the smaller size and faster shooting speeds of the new cameras, while the sensor size is an area where they seem to be lacking (Sony &amp; Samsung cameras are APS-C sized though). Currently the big makers - Nikon &amp; Canon - have practically no presence in this market (Nikon seems to be doing something with the V1). However, they seem to have slowed down the introduction of new entry level DSLR models over the last year as well.

So, as DSLR users looking to build and enhance their kit (there are many like me who've jumped the bandwagon over the last couple of years, and are just starting to build their kit), what are the advantages of sticking with the DSLR system rather than switching to the 3rd gen cameras?

IMO, one point that could cause a massive switch in the DSLR base would be if Nikon &amp; Canon announced mirror-less models compatible with their current lens lineups, but that is a hypothetical scenario.

P.S. There is a similar question on mirror-less cameras, but that seems to be from the perspective of a person starting out rather than a person already invested in the DSLR system.

Premium cameras with a larger focal plane exist because there is an advantage to that which mean photographers want and can work with.  Others are not even DSLR and are considered high-end Pro.  Look at cameras by Hasselblad, Leica, and Mamiya.  You can see both formats larger than ""full frame"" and lens mounts that don't need to make room for a mirror.  They have their advantages, too.

I think a new format will eventually emerge that does not exist today.  It will be larger than the 4/3rds system because of the advantages of a larger sensor regarding noise.  But it might not dominate because digital sensors have fairly well leveled the playing field as phone cameras clearly prove.

970,970,1536,How to configure ssh tunneling with Putty between two RHEL servers?,"I'm trying to allow ssh access from a remote RHEL server to a local RHEL box via Win/Putty gateway. Basically, I'd like to be able to do 'ssh localhost -p 512' on a remote server so that it would connect to the RHEL server in the local network. The local network is beyond a firewall so I can connect from my Win PC to the remote server with Putty/ssh but not vice verse.

LclSrv----WinXP/Putty-----||-----RmtSrv

So, I've added the following tunneling settings to the current RmtSrv session in Putty (actually I use Kitty but doesn't matter):

R512 LclSrv:22

I expect that this would create a process on the remote server that listens port 512 and transfers the connections to a local network/LclSrv port 22.

After pressing start button, Putty opens a regular ssh terminal session successfully but nothing happens. (options show active port forwarding). I've checked with netstat -l that port 512 is not listening on RmtSrv. ssh on this port returns 'connection refused'. What am I doing wrong? May be there is something in the sshd_config that needs to be changed in order to allow the tunneling? Could it be user privileges on RmtSrv that prevents me from creating tunnels? I have sudo btw.

Cheers, Vlad.

I've checked with netstat -l that port 512 is not listening on RmtSrv. ssh on this port returns 'connection refused'. What am I doing wrong? May be there is something in the sshd_config that needs to be changed in order to allow the tunneling? Could it be user privileges on RmtSrv that prevents me from creating tunnels? I have sudo btw.

Cheers, Vlad.
","On the left side of the Putty window you have a Menu. On it, SSH has a + to its left. Click there. Go to Tunnels. Configure them. Voilà.

4219,4219,6730,What lightweight telephoto lens are available for Nikon bodies?,"I'm looking for a lightweight telephoto lens for my Nikon D700 body, with a focal length around 300mm, good sharpness and AF. After several days with the 70-200 vrII handheld, I found this lens too big and heavy. I usually prefer the prime lenses, but all the good ~300mm prime I know weight 1.5kg or more.

I will use it mostly for sport, wildlife and landscape. A bonus point if it is bright enough for a use in dark concert stages :)

Nikon 70-300mm VR (750g, F5.6@300mm)
Nikon 180mm (760g) + 1.4x TC (F4@250mm)

5972,5972,9470,Declaring a globally-visible array in CodeIgniter for routing,"(Totally new to CodeIgniter and php, not new to programming)

In CodeIgniter, how or where can I declare an array that will be accessible in the router (CI_Router), in my custom controller and in the view loader (CI_Loader)? I want to avoid hard-coding data in the router and specifying the same data more than once (in the router and in the controller and/or view).

(Explanation follows; perhaps there is a better way to do what I'm trying to do.)

I have a site where I publish my freeware apps. The site is all static, but maintaining plain html by hand is a nightmare, so I'm trying to use CodeIgniter to generate the pages dynamically. Apart from a few loose ends like 'welcome' or 'contact info', the bulk of the site consists of highly structured application sections. Each app has the same set of pages: about, download, screenshots, etc. These pages all have the same exact layout and only differ in contents.

My main concern is maintainability and the amount of work that required to add a new app (or a new page for all apps). I see no reason to use multiple controllers (or even multiple views), because the only difference is in data (application identifiers), not in behavior or page layout.

My problem is with routing. I could do something like

$route['app1'] = 'main/apps/app1';
$route['app2'] = 'main/apps/app2';


...or loop over an array of app identifiers, but that seems really bad. When I add an application, I should not have to modify the router, since it's just another identifier added to a list, that will be used to pick page contents from an appropriate file.

What I would like to do instead is (pseudocode):

foreach (app in list_of_apps) {
  foreach (app_page in list_of_pages) {
    route['app/app_page'] = 'main/index/app/app_page'
  }
}


This would take care of all requests for 'app1/download' or 'app2/screenshots', etc. So where can I declare the arrays $list_of_apps and $list_of_pages so that they are visible in the router, in the controller, and later in view as well?

If you are building a public API, using REST with JSON or XML is popular in part because it's a very generic way to expose an API since clients don't generally need to generate code to use your API. Whereas with something like SOAP, code generation for the client is a lot more standard. If your clients are javascript, for instance, it's quite easy to use a RESTful service.

3931,3931,6270,How to Investigate Wi-Fi Intrusion and where to look for evidence?,"I'm trying to figure out how to configure a network so that I can tell what an intruder did (in the past) while on the network after they are detected. 
eg. If someone with a wi-fi enabled laptop parked outside my home and connected to my home network because he was able to crack my weak encryption. and if he were to do some fraudulent activity from my network, how can I configure my network and where would I have to look on the network to see what he was up to?
What devices would be able to log valuable information and how would I make sense of this information?
",Tony,https://security.stackexchange.com/users/18344,"Since I now know your question is theoretical, I can answer it better about how you can setup your network so you would be able to tell.  The exact way of setting it up will vary from device to device, but there are a lot of options available.  The key is that you need a device capable of logging that is in a location on the network that everything the person does will go through it.

For an average home network, this could be either the Wireless Access Point, the Router or if applicable, the gateway or firewall.  The wireless access point will get the information right as they get on to the network and will ensure that all activity coming in on the wireless network is logged, but if they were to use their wireless connection to compromise a wired system and then use the wired system, you would have an incomplete log.

Most likely the Router also serves as the gateway and firewall (the device that gives the rest of the network access to the Internet and ensures the Internet doesn't have unintended access to the private network).  Logging at the gateway and/or firewall ensures that all outbound traffic is logged, but won't tell you anything about what the intruder did internally on your network.

In most home networks, since there is only one router and it also generally serves as wireless access point, gateway and firewall, it will end up being privy to all connections flowing across the network.  It may not have access to all the contents of the packets it routes (if encryption is used) but it at least (by necessity) has access to the routing information (ie, where it is coming from and where it is going).  This is likely the best place in a home network to log.

Most consumer routers do not have this kind of logging by default, however third party firmwares such as DD-WRT often add logging capability to the routers that can either write to an internal store (limited space) or a network share.

eg. If someone with a wi-fi enabled laptop parked outside my home and connected to my home network because he was able to crack my weak encryption. and if he were to do some fraudulent activity from my network, how can I configure my network and where would I have to look on the network to see what he was up to?
What devices would be able to log valuable information and how would I make sense of this information?
","Since I now know your question is theoretical, I can answer it better about how you can setup your network so you would be able to tell.  The exact way of setting it up will vary from device to device, but there are a lot of options available.  The key is that you need a device capable of logging that is in a location on the network that everything the person does will go through it.

For an average home network, this could be either the Wireless Access Point, the Router or if applicable, the gateway or firewall.  The wireless access point will get the information right as they get on to the network and will ensure that all activity coming in on the wireless network is logged, but if they were to use their wireless connection to compromise a wired system and then use the wired system, you would have an incomplete log.

Most likely the Router also serves as the gateway and firewall (the device that gives the rest of the network access to the Internet and ensures the Internet doesn't have unintended access to the private network).  Logging at the gateway and/or firewall ensures that all outbound traffic is logged, but won't tell you anything about what the intruder did internally on your network.

In most home networks, since there is only one router and it also generally serves as wireless access point, gateway and firewall, it will end up being privy to all connections flowing across the network.  It may not have access to all the contents of the packets it routes (if encryption is used) but it at least (by necessity) has access to the routing information (ie, where it is coming from and where it is going).  This is likely the best place in a home network to log.

Most consumer routers do not have this kind of logging by default, however third party firmwares such as DD-WRT often add logging capability to the routers that can either write to an internal store (limited space) or a network share.  Exactly what information can be stored and how it is formatted varies from device to device, but in general information like the IP and MAC Address of the client as well as the requested destination IP, Port and protocol (such as TCP or UDP) as well as a timestamp can give you a lot of what you need to get at least a general idea of what was going on.

If space is no object, it may even be possible to log the content of every packet sent across the network, but that will be a huge amount of space and it may not be safe to exclude ""known"" MAC addresses from the logging to try and reduce the amount since MAC spoofing is fairly easy on a wireless network.

3188,3188,5080,Would magic 'weapons' make the monk more balanced?,"The monk in D&amp;D 3.5 (and, to a lesser extent, in Pathfinder) is generally considered underpowered. 

Would adding magic 'weapons' that could add enhancement bonuses and magic weapon effects to a monk's unarmed strikes be sufficient to re-balance them? Would they then be over-balanced?

To be specific I'm thinking of something like hand wraps that are a zero-cost weapon having no mundane effect on combat (the wielder counts as unarmed) but  that can be enchanted in the same way and at the same cost as a normal magic weapon.

From the PhB (which system?  Both.  Well, the CRB from Pathfinder, to be technical): ""A monk’s unarmed strike is treated both as a manufactured weapon and a natural weapon for the purpose of spells and effects that enhance or improve either manufactured weapons or natural weapons.""

Id, Craft Magic Arms and Armor: ""The weapon, armor, or shield to be enhanced must be a masterwork item that you provide. Its cost is not included in the above cost.""

Ultimate Magic (pathfinder only), Masterwork Transformation spell: ""Target: one weapon...""

You can, and should, already do this.  In 3.5 this requires that the GM rule that a Monk has a Masterwork body (pretty reasonable).  In pathfinder this requires a level 2 spell, or GM discretion.  I have a player who likes to play monks and this is usually something he puts a fair amount of money in.  I have run into issues doing this with less RAW-friendly groups, as reforging one's hands into the Fists of Fire and Thunder can upset people who have got it in their heads somehow that monks don't get magic weapon upgrades.  In fact, monks benefit from magic upgrades to their weaponry more than any other class, since they both can gain both natural-weapon-only benefits and manufactured-weapon-only benefits, and can have a great variety of specialized enchantments available pretty much all the time.

In both systems monks can make Unarmed Attacks with ""either fist interchangeably... elbows, knees, and feet"" (PHB, cf. CRB).  Enchanting each of these body parts separately allows an unburdened monk access to what are effectively 8 different magic weapons.  Her number of attacks doesn't change, but on each attack she can choose, as normal, which weapon she is employing.  This allows monks to make better use of energy damage and bane abilities than most other melee classes.  In campaigns where WBL is preserved by GM fiat the monk will never have the cash to do this, but in campaigns where spells and social abilities are allowed to generate their stated wealth without WBL limitations the party wizard should be able to provide the monk with a fairly kitted out set of enchantments around level 9.

Even with all this, however, the monk is still a spell-less melee fighter and so very underpowered.  The monk will be much better than a fellow student who for some reason refused magical augmentation, and, in fact, a decent melee build if the game is limited to the Core classes, since the monk's class abilities help somewhat compensate for most non-casters' lack of battlefield mobility (i.e. teleportation), but the monk is still a weak class.



N.B.: 

The benefit of doing your enchantments this way is, in order of importance 1) It's cooler.  You can have Hands of Justice and Feet of Law. 2) You save a magic item slot.  This is a big deal, as that slot can now be used to hold something like a Scarab of Protection or a Necklace of Netted Stars.  You can also keep your Amulet of Mighty Fists +5 and use that in place of your enhancement bonus on your body parts, saving room for more special abilities 2) Your enchantments can't be stolen the way external gear can.  It's always on your person and you can never permanently loose it without some very high level magic. 3) You can utilize all the defensive portions of the enchantments at once, and choose between the offensive portions as 'not an action' when making your attacks. 4) Technically, you save 300 gp.  Actually, if 300 gp matters most of your benefits are moot.

You do not uniquely gain the ability to use weapon enhancements by doing this.  You could do that already, via a Necklace of Natural Weapons or a Scorpion Kama, among other options.

2738,2738,4367,"Learning the musical concepts in the book ""Gödel, Escher, Bach""","I am reading the book ""Gödel, Escher, Bach"", in which the author tries to present concepts in mathematics, drawings and music as instances of a certain ""pattern"", that he calls ""strange loops"". He makes several comments about Bach's music, in particular, as the title suggests. So, he talks about the fugues, sonatas and partitas, modulation, themes played against themselves, how Bach manages to get two or more musical lines going simultaneously and so on.

But I don't understand a thing about these musical concepts. I have tried to listen on YouTube to some of the compositions he mentions in the book, but my stupid brain only hears a stream of notes flowing. I can't recognize the patterns he talks about, nor can I grasp, for example, the fact the the ""Canon per Tonos"" rises successively until it reaches the key C again. 

So how can I learn more about these musical concepts, so as to better follow the book's main ideas? To make this question narrower, I'm not asking for general references to learn about music, but something very specific to the content of the book, so that I don't miss important information (and fun) from his exposition.
",Otavio Macedo,https://music.stackexchange.com/users/12666,"I agree with luser droog's answer.

My understanding of the book (which I did not finish) was that there is an overall theme of language, which is then illustrated through the three artists. While the letters in each of these languages are based on natural, measurable, physical phenomena (projections to 2 dimensions in the visual language of Escher, mathematical elements in the metaphysics of Gödel, and musical tones in the language of Bach), the languages themselves (ie. the ""grammars"") are artificial.

He makes several comments about Bach's music, in particular, as the title suggests. So, he talks about the fugues, sonatas and partitas, modulation, themes played against themselves, how Bach manages to get two or more musical lines going simultaneously and so on.

But I don't understand a thing about these musical concepts. I have tried to listen on YouTube to some of the compositions he mentions in the book, but my stupid brain only hears a stream of notes flowing. I can't recognize the patterns he talks about, nor can I grasp, for example, the fact the the ""Canon per Tonos"" rises successively until it reaches the key C again. 

So how can I learn more about these musical concepts, so as to better follow the book's main ideas? To make this question narrower, I'm not asking for general references to learn about music, but something very specific to the content of the book, so that I don't miss important information (and fun) from his exposition.
","I agree with luser droog's answer.

My understanding of the book (which I did not finish) was that there is an overall theme of language, which is then illustrated through the three artists. While the letters in each of these languages are based on natural, measurable, physical phenomena (projections to 2 dimensions in the visual language of Escher, mathematical elements in the metaphysics of Gödel, and musical tones in the language of Bach), the languages themselves (ie. the ""grammars"") are artificial. 

The specific artists are not drawn out merely to indulge in a cult of personality, but because each were innovators in developing the modern features of their respective language. I suspect you may have guessed where I'm going with this.

",Mike B,https://diy.stackexchange.com/users/37651,"There should be no problem putting it all on a single 15 ampere circuit. Likely in the worst case scenario, each fixture would consume ~100 watts. That would be using large 52"" fans, and 100 watt bulbs in each fixture. With the 10 fixtures, that would be 1000 watts (10 * 100 = 1000). A 15 ampere 120 volt circuit can provide 1800 watts of power (15A * 120V). 

More realistically, you're going to be using lower wattage fixtures, especially nowadays with CFL and LED bulbs becoming more common. Here's some calculations based on various wattage devices. 


10 devices @ 75 watts each = 750 watts.
10 devices @ 60 watts each = 600 watts.
2 fans @ 100 watts, and 8 lights @ 60 watts = 680 watts.
2 fans @ 75 watts with 3 60 watt blub light kits, and 8 lights @ 100 watts = 1310 watts.

2672,2672,4257,How do I deal with a slow and undedicated colleague in the team?,"I have been working on a new project. The project works like this: The end user can access a webapp using a link and he can add multiple systems on his network and manage that particular systems details. My part involves the front end and the webserver, which is done in python. My python actually communicates with another project which is entirely done in c &amp; c++. The c/c++ project is the main app which does all the functionality. My python sends the user request to it and displays the response from it to the user. 

I am very familiar with my work and I will finish it soon. Since that's not much work in it. And I am a person who loves to work. I spends most of the time in office and only go home when I feel sleepy.

The c/c++ app is managed by another colleague who has 5+ year experience and can do things much faster than me, but he never does it. May be he doesn't like to do it. His app crashes often when my python communicate with it or returns wrong values. It's full of bugs. Since my app depends on it, I am having a hard time building it. Instead of fixing the bugs, he asks me to slow down my work. He asks me to tell manager that my work needs a lot of time. He is asking me to fool the manager and even forcing me to work slowly like him.

During project meeting, when manager asks him about the bugs he says that he fixed everything and it works fine. Since he is my colleague, I couldn't tell anything to the manager. I obviously need to have a good relationship with my colleagues more than my manager, since most of the time we will be with our colleagues, not with the manager.

I am not able to tell the manager anything regarding this, since if manager asks him why, then he may think I complained about him to the manager. And he keeps on lying in the meeting. And since he fixes the bug slowly, it even slows down my work. Now I thought of working on the front-end part of my app  and finishing it off so that in the mean time he can make his project stable. Now he is asking me to tell the manager that my front end part require a lot of work and I may need more and more time, simply so that he can drag the project down. And the sad thing is our actual manager has gone to the US, so we have a temporary manager and this guy doesn't know about the project much, so the c,c++ just fools him.

Can anyone suggest me how I deal with this?
I wanted to finish off the project soon. How can I make him work even by maintaining a good relationship with him?

Responses to comments:


  If he's really deliberately misleading the company, you should report him to management.


I am new to this company and the other guy has been there for many years. And I have just started knowing my colleagues. If I directly go and complaint him, I don't think so I can make good relationship with my other colleagues. Even he has the power to mislead them. I am not telling he is a bad guy, he can do the work, but he is not doing it.


  Doesn't your company have any kind of bug tracking system ? 


Here actual bug tracking system isn't there. The company tries to finish off the project as soon as possible and gives it to the QA. And then fixes the bugs reported by QA. 


  This is why companies should give employees stock / options or some sort of ownership. That way you can literally tell the guy ""You are costing me monetary growth... don't you want to make money also?"".


The company has the stock options they have given me a 2500 share, mostly he too would have got some more.


  Seniority does deserve some benefit of a doubt. You really need to speak to him first and try to understand the problem. He may be out of his depth, you may be able to help him, there could easily be variables you are unaware of. It may be hard now, but you could easily make the situation a lot worse by jumping the gun. 


I even does it, first his app wasn't handling multiple requests at a time, he was using a queue to handle the requests I sent to him. I even suggested to him some of my ideas on it. He said he already had these ideas, and will be executing them. His explanations was: ""Everything require certain time to do and this is a project which may need two years to complete and we are asked to finish it in two months"". I used to have a hard time coding during first few weeks because of this bug. But now he fixed it. But he is using a single queue for a user requests and that is now slowing down the app, since it processes one request at a time.


  What is QA doing this whole time? Why aren't they reporting/confirming the status of the project(s)? 


The manager is the person who decides when to give to the QA. As of now it has not yet given to QA. He said we should give it by this month end. 
",HOT,https://programmers.stackexchange.com/users/34092,"As others have mentioned, behaving professionally is the single most important thing for your long-term career.  And honestly, as long as you behave professionally, you'll be in pretty good shape, no matter how those around you behave.  

In this situation, there are a couple of considerations you need to take into account.

First, you need to understand that you are responsible for your program working to the desired specifications, by the given deadline.  If your program interoperates with someone else's program, you are also responsible for making sure that that other program also works by the same deadline.  To put this differently:  If the other person misses their deadline, then you have also missed your deadline, even if your own part of the project was on time.  In management terms, this is called owning the inputs.

You have correctly noted that when your colleague declares in a meeting that his program's bugs are fixed, that you can't immediately declare him as incorrect to the manager (your manager would see that as ""throwing your co-worker under the bus"";  a very bad career move).  Others, on the other hand, have pointed out that it is unprofessional not to declare the true state of the project to the manager.  Both sides are completely correct.

So if it's bad to contradict your colleague in front of the manager, and it's also bad to not contradict him, then what do you do?

The answer is actually pretty simple:  You need to talk to your colleague well before the meeting with the manager, and let them know that at the upcoming meeting you're going to need to tell the manager about the troubles you've been having with their program, and that it's impacting your ability to deliver your side of the project on time, and whether there's anything you can do to help them address the troubles you've been having.  You need to have this conversation at least two full days before the meeting where you will tell the manager, and preferably a full week in advance.

In most cases, just telling your colleague that you're going to have to list their program as a risk at a particular meeting will get them motivated to address the problems you're having, and you never have to talk to the manager at all.  In others, where the problems are more schedule-driven, the colleague will often agree with you, and the two of you can go to the manager together.

I've never had a colleague who didn't either fix things up for me quickly or else agree with my concerns, when expressed this way.  But if it did happen, by giving your colleague advance warning you'd still be in a better position when talking to the manager.  Since you talked to your colleague and tried to work out a solution on your own, and warned them well in advance that you would need to raise the issue at this meeting, your colleague won't be surprised when they do, and the manager won't think that you're simply trying to shift the blame.

Do please remember that when you express your concerns, either to the colleague or to the manager, that your concerns are about your colleague's program which is returning bad data (or whatever else it's doing);  these are measurable things which can be verified and fixed.  Your concerns are not about your colleague being slow or undedicated;  these are not measurable things, which may or may not be true, and which are unlikely to be fixed by bringing them up in a meeting in front of the boss.

For observer wards, you can try the usual ward spots (runes/rosh/hills).... however, if your five-man push fails because the enemy saw you coming, there are a lot of possible ward spots you may have walked by. And how about countering sentry wards to protect a riki/gondar/brood?
",Robert Fraser,https://gaming.stackexchange.com/users/3074,"The true answer is not to guess, but to know. Watch your minimap and your opponents' inventories constantly. In most games, it will be the enemy support heroes placing the majority if not all of the wards so you'll know where to focus your attention. If they are carrying wards you need to monitor their hero as much as possible and notice when that ward count drops by 1. When it does, you should know where they've been and where the common ward spots in that area are. If you've kept Observer Wards up yourself, you can determine exactly where they've placed it because doing so causes an animation. If you don't see this, you can usually narrow it down to one of a few spots and counterward appropriately. Most good counterwarding locations will reveal multiple frequently warded spots in an area- the reveal range of 950 is much larger than the vision range.

It's also worth noting that many of the common support heroes have spells that reveal high ground (allowing you to counter wards on hills or high ground that you couldn't otherwise see). AA's slow, Dazzle's ultimate, VS's howl, and others.

The other way to counterward requires a lot of experience and an expectation of high level opposition. Judging from how your opponents react to movement and gank attempts by your own team, you can tell when they've spotted someone moving between lanes and thus where they've warded. This is much more difficult and really only applicable if you're playing against competent opponents, weaker players are usally too sporadic for their reactions to be of much use. For example, I know that after a successful teamfight win in midgame by a good opposing team their supports will probably be spending the downtime placing offensive wards. With a combination of everything you've read above, I can make the chances of succesfully counterwarding worth the 100 gold chance to possibly catch a ward even if I don't know exactly where one has been placed.

As for the second part of your question, you will never really deliberately counter Sentry Wards unless it's to protect your own Observer Wards since doing so requires that the area be clear of opponents and thus their Sentry wards are unlikely to be used again anyway, they only last 3 minutes.

3740,3740,5957,Structure for nitrate ion?,"

Why is the above structure not considered a valid structure for the nitrate ion? Is it because adding a double bond reduces the formal charges present on the nitrogen? Does the above form exist anywhere?
",1110101001,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/users/2142,"Nitrate actually exists as a superposition of these three resonance forms:



Essentially, a lone pair from an oxygen with a negative formal change forms a double bond to nitrogen. However, as nitrogen is a period II element, and hence must obey the octet rule, it can not have 5 bonds to other atoms. The already-present double bond then turns into a single bond and the pair of electrons moves onto the oxygen. This ""movement"" can happen with all three of the oxygen atoms and all three of the bonds. This is called ""resonance"".

Due to resonance, the energy of the system is minimised making it more stable.

Your Lewis structure is not far off. The ""true"" structure of nitrate is:



Approximately, each oxygen atom contributes one third of a bond with the nitrogen, lowering the formal charge on each atom from what you have written, which does not exist in nature.

4726,4726,7500,Roguelike Class Structure Makes Everything Effectively Global,"A brief rundown of the hierarchy of the game data objects:

Configuration - loaded from XML files, has Descriptors, among other things

Atlas - has a Configuration, has a CreatureInstance(represents the player's creature instance), is an associative array of AtlasColumns

AtlasColumn - has an Atlas(parent), is an associative array of AtlasCells

AtlasCell - has an AtlasColumn(parent), is an associative array of Layers

Layer - has an AtlasCell(parent), is an associative array of LayerColumns

LayerColumn - has a Layer(parent), is an associative array of LayerCells

LayerCell - has a LayerColumn(parent), has a CreatureInstance, a array of ItemInstances, and a TerrainInstance

CreatureInstance/ItemInstance/TerrainInstance - has a LayerCell(parent), has a Descriptor

Descriptor - has an associative array of properties needed by an instance to do its particular function

The most important thing in the Configuration are the Descriptors.  A Descriptor has all of the properties that are needed by the various types of instances. It has properties that drive behavior, what it looks like on screen, and so on.

So here's the part that bothers me:

Everything... EVERYTHING, from Atlas to TerrainInstance can talk up and down the entire chain, the reason being that if, for example, the TerrainInstance is a square upon which a player steps and suddenly a number of monsters are conjured around him, the TerrainInstance needs to have access to the neighboring LayerCells.  Or for another example if a CreatureInstance when attacking the player's CreatureInstance is able to take items from the player's inventory, and relocate them somewhere else in the dungeon, it needs access to a different Layer or AtlasCell in order to put the item where it needs to go.

An alternative that would appear to be ""better encapsulated"" might be a messaging system that sends little message objects up and down the chain and handles things at the appropriate level, but is that really any BETTER than just having the objects be aware of one another?

The game I'm writing started out with mostly hardcoded item and creature types, and gradually morphed its way into something similar to the more flexible roguelike framework that I've detailed above. I'm finally switching from C# to Java for it(the language is immaterial, however), and I'd like to not have missed something glaringly obvious that will cause great pains later when I need to refactor it.

So, the question: is the apparent lack of encapsulation within the data/business objects of the game demonstrate a fatal flaw in the architecture?  And if so, what is that flaw and how can I correct it before I get too far along?
",PlayDeezGames,https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/users/12875,"There's nothing wrong with objects knowing about other objects. That doesn't defy encapsulation.

  Or for another example if a CreatureInstance when attacking the player's CreatureInstance is able to take items from the player's inventory, and relocate them somewhere else in the dungeon, it needs access to a different Layer or AtlasCell in order to put the item where it needs to go.


What you're saying is that the CreatureInstance itself needs to directly do the following:


Detect that it's attack hit the target.
Look in the inventory of the target.
Remove some items form it.
Place those items in the world.


This is highly unnecessary. Why does the CreatureInstance have to do this? Yes, conceptually, it is the creature's attack that causes items to be removed. But why does the CreatureInstance object have to deal with that?

Here's how I would do it.

The CreatureInstance would have one or more Attacks. An Attack is an object that, when successful, can cause one or more effects. Effects include:


Dealing damage, possibly with damage types.
Removing items from the target and placing them on the map.
etc.


All the CreatureInstance has to know is what Attacks it can perform and who it can perform them on. When it decides to use the DrainItemsAttack, it simply says, ""I'm using DrainItemsAttack on this target.""

The DrainItemsAttack would invoke the ""RemoveAndDropItems"" effect. That's not a class; that's a free function (or a static member of some class, since you're using languages that don't allow free functions). It doesn't have to have state, so it doesn't need to be a type. It's just a function that takes some number of inventory items from a CreatureInstance and places them on the ground.

It is that function which needs to be able to inspect inventory, remove items, find suitable terrain to place them on, etc. Each of these operations should be its own function. So your ""RemoveAndDropItems"" effect would be implemented like this (pseudo-code):

bool RemoveAndDropItems(int numToRemove, CreatureInstance target, Atlas world)
{
  for(numToRemove)
  {
    ItemInstance item = target.FindSuitableItemToRemove();
    if(!item)
      return false;
    target.RemoveItem(item);
    LayerCell loc = world.FindSuitableLocationToPlaceItem(item, target.loc());
    world.PlaceItem(item, loc);
  }
  return true;
}


This way, CreatureInstance isn't responsible for finding places to put stuff. You have functions for that. Nor does it have to have knowledge of ItemInstance or other types; that's all taken care of elsewhere.

1718,1718,2720,Is research a viable business model?,"I have had the suspicion that it may be for a while and apparently not all is a product of my mind. Let me quote from an answer:


  In my experience, in UK and other European countries, the research
  funding comes from successful proposals to the relevant funding
  bodies. There are research centres that were established and keep
  going only because the staff there constantly submits project
  proposals (somebody told me that the success rate is 1 out of 5 or
  maybe even lower).


There are two questions here.


Can a company feasibly focus on obtaining funds in publicly funded research (as a business model) successfully enough to ""survive""?
Can such a company be started (nearly) from scratch?


In short, the company would be exactly like a research institute (or institution) except that it would be private.

Reasons why question 1 may not be feasible:


I don't see any company doing this kind of thing, i.e. there may be some, but there are not many, which means that it may be hard. It's a bad sign.
Public funds seem to be assigned to public entities, while companies can benefit from the collaboration and synergy, but they are expected to get their funding from their work as companies (searching for customers, etc.) In this case the customers would be the partners in the projects and the society itself, but again, this seems to be an ""innovative"" (maybe naïve, or even plain stupid) idea.
Research is a means for something, not an end on itself, that's why the business model should be on something else (point two) and that's why such a company would raise eyebrows on the mere idea of its existence. It may even be against some kind of tacit rule or even written laws.


Reasons why question 2 may not be feasible:


No previous history of success of the company, or products or anything means zero (or negative) trustworthiness and no projects assigned to the company.
No partners would like to associate with the company in a project for the reasons in point 1.
The most similar case I can think of are spin-off companies that are created from successful research labs, not from scratch.
OMG so much communism! Go to kickstarter you hippie!


As an example, a possible scenario that could be close to this: Someone writes a paper about a software system that does something not very novel in the state of the art but in a way that is very different from an architectural point of view, leading to good results in practical terms. In short: in theory nothing is new, in practice what was just a dream is now a reality. What is done remains the same in theory, but how it is done is completely different in practice (and now it works). Unfortunately only a proof of concept (PoC) can reasonably be implemented.

Would it be feasible to request funds to continue the development of this PoC (still very far from a commercial product) as a start-up or that simply doesn't make sense?

634,634,1000,Is it better to go first or last in Vinci?,"My son is convinced that it's best to go last in Vinci because you have the more complete information of seeing where other players have started their civilizations and you always get last turn (like having home field advantage in baseball). I see these 2 advantages, but I wonder if these outweigh the disadvantages such as not having first pick on civilizations, not being the first to go into decline, and perhaps other factors I haven't even considered (we're all new to the game). So:

Is it better to go first, last, in between, or is the game so well balanced that it hardly matters?
",Joe Golton,https://boardgames.stackexchange.com/users/2260,"This is very difficult question to answer because so much of it depends on your experience, play-style, and how the random elements of the game turn out.  These games have sufficient complexity that, based on how they are played by humans, going either first or last might be an advantage.

It's certain that one's play-style preferences will affect this decision.  If you are one who more often likes to find a best response to your opponent's moves, then going later will be 'better' since it suits your play-style, this you'll win more often going later than going earlier.  However, if you're one who prefers to be more strategic, going earlier might yield you more wins.

Two things to note:


If you have the choice of consistently going in a certain order, keep choosing the one you have the most experience with.  This will enable you to remove one variable of the game, and allow you to improve your skill in the game faster.
There ARE certain combinations of races and powers that are clearly better, especially in terms of how they interact, than others.

I have seen these two advantages, but I want to know if they exceed the disadvantages, such as no first choice of civilization, no first decline, and perhaps other factors I have not even considered (we are all novices). So:","This is very difficult question to answer because so much of it depends on your experience, play-style, and how the random elements of the game turn out.  These games have sufficient complexity that, based on how they are played by humans, going either first or last might be an advantage.

It's certain that one's play-style preferences will affect this decision.  If you are one who more often likes to find a best response to your opponent's moves, then going later will be 'better' since it suits your play-style, this you'll win more often going later than going earlier.  However, if you're one who prefers to be more strategic, going earlier might yield you more wins.

Two things to note:


If you have the choice of consistently going in a certain order, keep choosing the one you have the most experience with.  This will enable you to remove one variable of the game, and allow you to improve your skill in the game faster.
There ARE certain combinations of races and powers that are clearly better, especially in terms of how they interact, than others.  This means that in certain games, it will be more advantageous to grab them, thus go earlier.  However, it's not at all clear that these situations happen often enough to offset any advantages (if they exist) from going later.

The project works like this: The end user can access a webapp using a link and he can add multiple systems on his network and manage that particular systems details. My part involves the front end and the webserver, which is done in python. My python actually communicates with another project which is entirely done in c &amp; c++. The c/c++ project is the main app which does all the functionality. My python sends the user request to it and displays the response from it to the user. 

I am very familiar with my work and I will finish it soon. Since that's not much work in it. And I am a person who loves to work. I spends most of the time in office and only go home when I feel sleepy.

The c/c++ app is managed by another colleague who has 5+ year experience and can do things much faster than me, but he never does it. May be he doesn't like to do it. His app crashes often when my python communicate with it or returns wrong values. It's full of bugs. Since my app depends on it, I am having a hard time building it. Instead of fixing the bugs, he asks me to slow down my work. He asks me to tell manager that my work needs a lot of time. He is asking me to fool the manager and even forcing me to work slowly like him.

During project meeting, when manager asks him about the bugs he says that he fixed everything and it works fine. Since he is my colleague, I couldn't tell anything to the manager. I obviously need to have a good relationship with my colleagues more than my manager, since most of the time we will be with our colleagues, not with the manager.

I am not able to tell the manager anything regarding this, since if manager asks him why, then he may think I complained about him to the manager. And he keeps on lying in the meeting. And since he fixes the bug slowly, it even slows down my work. Now I thought of working on the front-end part of my app  and finishing it off so that in the mean time he can make his project stable. Now he is asking me to tell the manager that my front end part require a lot of work and I may need more and more time, simply so that he can drag the project down. And the sad thing is our actual manager has gone to the US, so we have a temporary manager and this guy doesn't know about the project much, so the c,c++ just fools him.

Can anyone suggest me how I deal with this?
I wanted to finish off the project soon. How can I make him work even by maintaining a good relationship with him?

  If he's really deliberately misleading the company, you should report him to management.


I am new to this company and the other guy has been there for many years. And I have just started knowing my colleagues. If I directly go and complaint him, I don't think so I can make good relationship with my other colleagues. Even he has the power to mislead them. I am not telling he is a bad guy, he can do the work, but he is not doing it.


  Doesn't your company have any kind of bug tracking system ? 


Here actual bug tracking system isn't there. The company tries to finish off the project as soon as possible and gives it to the QA. And then fixes the bugs reported by QA. 


  This is why companies should give employees stock / options or some sort of ownership. That way you can literally tell the guy ""You are costing me monetary growth... don't you want to make money also?"".


The company has the stock options they have given me a 2500 share, mostly he too would have got some more.


  Seniority does deserve some benefit of a doubt. You really need to speak to him first and try to understand the problem. He may be out of his depth, you may be able to help him, there could easily be variables you are unaware of. It may be hard now, but you could easily make the situation a lot worse by jumping the gun. 


I even does it, first his app wasn't handling multiple requests at a time, he was using a queue to handle the requests I sent to him. I even suggested to him some of my ideas on it. He said he already had these ideas, and will be executing them. His explanations was: ""Everything require certain time to do and this is a project which may need two years to complete and we are asked to finish it in two months"". I used to have a hard time coding during first few weeks because of this bug. But now he fixed it. But he is using a single queue for a user requests and that is now slowing down the app, since it processes one request at a time.


  What is QA doing this whole time? Why aren't they reporting/confirming the status of the project(s)? 


The manager is the person who decides when to give to the QA. As of now it has not yet given to QA. He said we should give it by this month end.

239,239,384,How does arbitary code execution work?,"I'm unable to understand how arbitrary code execution vulnerabilities are supposed to work.

Wikipedia mentions:


  Arbitrary code execution is commonly achieved through control over the instruction pointer of a running process.


Say, the vulnerability is being triggered by some maliciously crafted file that said process is reading. How could it modify the instruction pointer, or, otherwise, corrupt the internal state of the application so as to cause it to execute the attacker's code?

Also, given that modern OSes implement DEP and ASLR, how is this even feasible? The data loaded from the application would not even be executable, and additionally, it's also difficult to determine the offset of the shellcode/payload.

",user2064000,https://security.stackexchange.com/users/22260,"Code injection / Code execution is any attack that involves tricking a node in a distributed system into running code specified in a network message that was supposed to be treated as plain text/bytes.

The arbitrary part means that the vulnerability allows the attacker to make use of the full authority of the running process or of some privileged principle like root.




  given that modern OSes implement DEP and ASLR, how is this even feasible


Code injection relies on some other kind of vulnerability to inject the payload.  You're probably thinking of injection via buffer overflow but there are other ways to inject code that memory address space tricks don't help against.

Code injection doesn't necessarily mean injecting instructions in the processor's instruction set into a code/data segment.  It can mean injecting source code in a scripting language which the program foolishly interprets.  For example, shell injection involves injecting bytes that are passed to a shell.


  Shell injection (or Command Injection[10])is named after Unix shells, but applies to most systems which allow software to programmatically execute a command line. Typical shell injection-related functions include system(), StartProcess(), and System.Diagnostics.Process.Start().




Some systems have used string tainting * to try to mitigate code injections that aren't covered by DEP/ASLR and it does help but isn't foolproof:  taint bits aren't serialized when strings are serialized to files/DBs and, under maintenance, more untaint instructions are added to a program to fix high visibility non-security bugs than are removed to fix low-visibility security vulnerabilities.


  The concept behind taint checking is that any variable that can be modified by an outside user (for example a variable set by a field in a web form) poses a potential security risk. If that variable is used in an expression that sets a second variable, that second variable is now also suspicious. The taint checking tool proceeds variable by variable until it has a complete list of all variables which are potentially influenced by outside input.




Systems that label strings based on information flow have also been used to secure distributed systems that have to mix strings of different provenance, but information-flow is more of an all-or-nothing approach: harder to retrofit onto systems that were not designed around it.


  Information ﬂow control protects information security
  by constraining how information is transmitted among
  objects and users of various security classes. These security classes are expressed as labels associated with the information or its containers.


Taint-checking, above, is a very simple kind of information flow analysis in which the labels are restricted to (tainted, untainted).

566,566,889,Tripod Head for GigaPan Epic Pro,"I get massively confused when it comes to tripod heads screw sizes blah de blah, so excuse the possible simplicity of this question. I have a GigaPan Epic Pro and a Manfrotto 475B Pro Geared Tripod. I also have a 2 way tilt head that came with my Monopod which I am currently using as the head for this tripod as well. 

Problem is that this head doesn't seem the most stable to place the massive GigaPan unit on with a Nikon D4 and a 400mm lens (all in all a damn heavy setup!). The GigaPan unit has what I call the 'normal' screw (or is it a thread?) which is the same one you get in the bottom of almost every camera known to man these days (like I said, I'm useless when it comes to this stuff). The tripod has the 'big' screw (thread?) that the heads screw in to. This is all pretty normal. Here are my questions;

1- What are these screws/threads actually called, I've seen 1/4 inch and 3/8 inch thrown around a lot and I'd guess that 1/4 inch is the 'normal' one and the 3/8 the 'big' one?

2 - For the GigaPan I'd ideally place it straight onto the 'big' screw, obviously this is not possible, but would this Manfrotto 120 3/8 to 1/4 inch Adaptor be pretty much what I am after.

These might seem very simple questions but trust me, I consider myself a pretty decent photographer but when it comes to this I really struggle to get my head around it.

Thanks!

(also I didn't have the rep to create the tag 'GigaPan', but I think it should be, so feel free to add it! )
",Rob Quincey,https://photo.stackexchange.com/users/6209,"The GigaPan Epic Pro itself weighs 7.25lbs with battery. Then once you add in a Nikon D4(2 lb 15.3 oz), and a Nikon 400mm f/2.8G ED AF-S (10.2lbs), you are talking about putting roughly 20lbs of gear on the tripod. This is significant, but certainly not unheard of.

The GigaPan Epic Pro has the standard 1/4-20 tripod screw at the bottom. You can read more about that here: Is there a standard tripod mount? 

My assumption is that GigaPan included this standard screw so you can mount the camera to a non proprietary setup. If they chose any other screw, they would either have to engage head manufacturers to develop custom quick release brackets, or create their own heads. 

I know that one option you brought up would be to mount legs directly to the GigaPan. I think that this might cause you issues. The reason is that without a proper head that locks into the legs, you might risk the connection between the legs and GigaPan loosening up. I cannot say this from experience, but I think you would be best suited with a very sturdy head.

For a head you might want to look at something like a Manfrotto Hydrostatic Ball head. They do an excellent job of making sure that the lock and ball aren't going anywhere.

The above may give (too many) multiple results if the consecutive misses are more than 3. So, If you want only the members and events they missed but not when they missed attendance, replace the SELECT with (test: SQL-Fiddle-2): 

SELECT DISTINCT
  m.member_id AS id,
  ed.event_id,

You could also wrap the query (as a derived table) inside an external query and do another grouping for this to work (test: SQL-Fiddle-3)

The above may give (too many) multiple results if the consecutive misses are more than 3. So, If you want only the members and events they missed but not when they missed attendance, replace the SELECT with (test: SQL-Fiddle-2): 

SELECT DISTINCT
  m.member_id AS id,
  ed.event_id,
FROM
  ...


You could also wrap the query (as a derived table) inside an external query and do another grouping for this to work (test: SQL-Fiddle-3)



And if you want only the members and not the events they missed nor when they missed attendance:

SELECT DISTINCT

Someone mentioned that he guessed the correct number five times in a row, and said that this was surprising because the probability of this happening was $$\left(\frac{1}{38}\right)^5$$

This is true if you only play the game $5$ times. However, if you play it more than $5$ times there's a higher (should be much higher?) probability that you'll get $5$ in a row at some point. 

I was thinking about how surprised this person should be at their streak of $m$ correct guesses given that they play $n$ games, each with probability $p$ of success. It makes intuitive sense that their surprise should be proportional to $1/q$ (or maybe $\log(1/q)$ since $1$ in a billion doesn't surprise you $10$ times more than $1$ in $100$ million), where $q$ is the probability that they get at least one streak of $m$ correct guesses at some point in their $n$ games. 

So, with the Roulette example I was thinking about, $p=1/38$ and $m=5$. 

I tried to find an explicit formula for $q$ in terms of $n$, and encountered some difficulty, because of the non-independence of ""getting a streak in the first five tries"" and ""getting a streak in tries $2$ through $6$"" (if the first is a failure, it's much more  likely that the second will be too).

The variables satisfy $\,\,\,m,n \in \mathbb{N}$, $\,\,\,m\leq n$, $\,\,\,p \in \mathbb{R}$, $\,\,\,0 \leq p \leq 1$.



If we write the answer to the second question as a function $q(m,n,p)$, then we can say that $q$ should be increasing with $n$, decreasing with $m$, and increasing with $p$. It should equal $p^n$ when $m=n$ and should equal $1$ when $p=1$ and $0$ when $p=0$. 

I feel as though this should be a basic probability problem, but I'm having trouble solving it. Maybe some kind of recursive approach would work? Given $q(n,m,p)$, I think I could write $q(n+1,m,p)$ using the probability that the last $m-1$ results are all successes ...

$$q_n \sim \frac{1-px}{(r+1-rx)q} \cdot \frac{1}{x^{n+1}}  $$

where $x$ is the smallest positive root of $1 - x + q p^r x^{r+1} = 0$.

For your problem, we have $r = 5$, $p = 1/38$, and $q = 37/38$, from which we calculate $x \approx 1 + 1.228854 \times 10^{-8}$.  

It works out that $q_n = 1/2$ for $n \approx 5.64 \times 10^7$, i.e. it takes about 56 million trials to have a 50% chance of guessing correctly 5 times in a row.

I have an electric vehicle that seemed to handle driving through large puddles during the last storm but I was curious if anyone could tell me what the potential hazards are of driving an EV through a large standing pool of water. 

I don't need to worry about getting water in the engine (I think) since there is no air intake. There are fans that cool the battery if it gets too hot but I don't think that will be a problem during this storm.

204,204,328,Does this C++ static analysis rule make sense as is?,"I'm implementing some C++ static analysis rules, and one of them prohibits a function from returning a reference or pointer to a reference parameter of the function, i.e. the following are all non-compliant:

const int *g(const int&amp; x) { return &amp;x; } // #2
int&amp; h(int&amp; x) { return x; } // #3
const int&amp; m(const int&amp; x) { return x; } // #4


The justification given for this is that ""It is implementation-defined behaviour whether the reference parameter is a temporary object or a reference to the parameter.""

I'm puzzled by this, however, because stream operators in C++ are written in this way, e.g.

std::ostream&amp; operator&lt;&lt;(std::ostream&amp; os, const X&amp; x) {
    //...
    return os;

I think I'm pretty confident that stream operators in C++ do not in general exhibit implementation-defined behaviour, so what's going on?

According to my understanding as it is at present, I would expect #1 and #3 to be well-defined, on the basis that temporaries cannot be bound to non-const references, so int&amp; x refers to a real object that has lifetime beyond the scope of the function, hence returning a pointer or reference to that object is fine. I would expect #2 to be dodgy, because a temporary could have been bound to const int&amp; x, in which case trying to take its address would seem a bad plan. I'm not sure about #4 - my gut feeling is that that's also potentially dodgy, but I'm not sure. In particular, I'm not clear on what would happen in the following case:

4919,4919,7831,Is there a name for the number of values a variable can take?,"For example, a bit or a boolean can be either 0 or 1 so the number 2 is associated with it. Similarly, for a byte which is 8 bits, the maximum number of different assignments would be 2^8.

Is there a name for this number?

When we pass everything through our system that has ECMAScript, Java and MySQL, then a boolean does not have only two possible assignments. For instance, a false boolean gets saved as a 0 and the boxed value could be null so a boolean suddenly can get true, false, 0, 1, null or even undefined or &lt;missing&gt;.

I think it could get problematic in tests to guarantee that the values are not inconsistent. For instance, a value boolean locked could become null and then when a script or a layout template evaluates it then it will evaluate to false somewhere if the real value was null and similar problems.

So why don't we always assert that a boolean has the same number of possible values (2 values) and similarly for other types?

There is a mathematical term named ""arity"" that is something similar but not exactly, and statistics and probability theory also has the concept of ""event space"" that would be almost exactly what I mean. For instance, the event space for a boolean would be the set {0,1} which has cardinality 2 and that cardinality doesn't get preserved throughout the system, especially when data is passed as polyglots and/or serialized (json, jsonp, xml, yaml).

Once you start to consider variables that have a range of valid values and also a range of invalid values (like a boolean with a bitwise value of 17), then you have to extend the concept somewhat, but you can still describe those values with set notation and the concept of cardinality still applies.

Edit: Yes, this is the mathematical set, not programming Set. If you were to apply the concept to the C# type short and derive the type short?, this would not have 65537 values, represented by the union of the set of 65536 values mentioned previously and one additional value, null.

I can't edit the file MainFile.vb
I can't create another constructor
All I can do is -- since the MyAwesomeClass is a Partial Class; I can create another file e.g. ExtendedFile.vb and write my lines of code


So I'm trying to do like this which is not allowed in .NET:

should execute all the below lines for objAwesome (and in the same order, too)

",Ruchir Gupta,https://stackoverflow.com/users/3832403,"You can think of a partial class as code in separate files. Then compiler will merge it in one class file.

One solution is to just make new inherited class and override constructor.

Second solution is to make Shared (static) method builder:

Partial Class MyAwesomeClass
    Public Shared Function Create() As MyAwesomeClass
    ' your code goes here
    ' calling base instance creation


Third solution is to make different signature for second constructor, because you cannot have two methods in class with same name and signature, e.g.

Partial Class MyAwesomeClass
    Public Sub New(Dim x As Integer, Dim buildWithNewAwesomeImplementation as Boolean) ' 
        Me.New(x) ' calling base constructor

Ultimately I want to do something like - When I create an object of MyAwesomeClass; it should execute Line1_of_code() to Line6_of_code(). I.e.

Dim objAwesome As New MyAwesomeClass(5) ' Any Integer will do


should execute all the below lines for objAwesome (and in the same order, too)

Line1_of_code()
Line2_of_code()
Line3_of_code()
Line4_of_code()
Line5_of_code()
Line6_of_code()


I'm using .NET Fx 4.0 -- Is there any workaround or solution? Any help would be appreciated.
","You can think of a partial class as code in separate files. Then compiler will merge it in one class file.

One solution is to just make new inherited class and override constructor.

Second solution is to make Shared (static) method builder:

Partial Class MyAwesomeClass
    Public Shared Function Create() As MyAwesomeClass
    ' your code goes here
    ' calling base instance creation


Third solution is to make different signature for second constructor, because you cannot have two methods in class with same name and signature, e.g.

Partial Class MyAwesomeClass
    Public Sub New(Dim x As Integer, Dim buildWithNewAwesomeImplementation as Boolean) ' 
        Me.New(x) ' calling base constructor
        If(buildWithNewAwesomeImplementation)
          Line4_of_code()
          Line5_of_code()
          Line6_of_code()
        End if
    End Sub
End Class


First solution seems more reasonable.

3176,3176,5060,How to know which edition a DotNetNuke site is,"This may be a silly question, but I recently inherited a DotNetNuke site.  Looking in the settings, I can see it's running version 4.09.00 of DNN.

Were these editions also available in the 4.0 version of DNN?
If so, is there a way to tell which edition the site is running?  I didn't see any immediately obvious designation in the admin areas.

",AtlasEU,https://gaming.stackexchange.com/users/43767,"Ladder ranking (LR) is (presumably) like hidden Matchmaking Rating (MMR), but offset by an unknown amount, and inflated by Bonus Pool.

Ladder ranking changes similarly to MMR, rising and dropping depending on the relative strength of your opponents, but it becomes offset by following factors:


LR has different ""zero point"" in different leagues (and League ranges should not overlap much, theoretically).
LR cannot be negative, so if you keep losing, your MMR diverges from ladder points.
LR is inflated by Bonus Pool, so, assuming all players spend their bonus pool, everyone's Ladder points drift up from their MMR by some (same for everyone) amount.

5981,5981,9482,How do I deal with a slow and undedicated colleague in the team?,"I have been working on a new project. The project works like this: The end user can access a webapp using a link and he can add multiple systems on his network and manage that particular systems details. My part involves the front end and the webserver, which is done in python. My python actually communicates with another project which is entirely done in c &amp; c++. The c/c++ project is the main app which does all the functionality. My python sends the user request to it and displays the response from it to the user. 

I am very familiar with my work and I will finish it soon. Since that's not much work in it. And I am a person who loves to work. I spends most of the time in office and only go home when I feel sleepy.

The c/c++ app is managed by another colleague who has 5+ year experience and can do things much faster than me, but he never does it. May be he doesn't like to do it. His app crashes often when my python communicate with it or returns wrong values. It's full of bugs. Since my app depends on it, I am having a hard time building it. Instead of fixing the bugs, he asks me to slow down my work. He asks me to tell manager that my work needs a lot of time. He is asking me to fool the manager and even forcing me to work slowly like him.

During project meeting, when manager asks him about the bugs he says that he fixed everything and it works fine. Since he is my colleague, I couldn't tell anything to the manager. I obviously need to have a good relationship with my colleagues more than my manager, since most of the time we will be with our colleagues, not with the manager.

I am not able to tell the manager anything regarding this, since if manager asks him why, then he may think I complained about him to the manager. And he keeps on lying in the meeting. And since he fixes the bug slowly, it even slows down my work. Now I thought of working on the front-end part of my app  and finishing it off so that in the mean time he can make his project stable. Now he is asking me to tell the manager that my front end part require a lot of work and I may need more and more time, simply so that he can drag the project down. And the sad thing is our actual manager has gone to the US, so we have a temporary manager and this guy doesn't know about the project much, so the c,c++ just fools him.

Can anyone suggest me how I deal with this?
I wanted to finish off the project soon. How can I make him work even by maintaining a good relationship with him?

  If he's really deliberately misleading the company, you should report him to management.


I am new to this company and the other guy has been there for many years. And I have just started knowing my colleagues. If I directly go and complaint him, I don't think so I can make good relationship with my other colleagues. Even he has the power to mislead them. I am not telling he is a bad guy, he can do the work, but he is not doing it.


  Doesn't your company have any kind of bug tracking system ? 


Here actual bug tracking system isn't there. The company tries to finish off the project as soon as possible and gives it to the QA. And then fixes the bugs reported by QA. 


  This is why companies should give employees stock / options or some sort of ownership. That way you can literally tell the guy ""You are costing me monetary growth... don't you want to make money also?"".


The company has the stock options they have given me a 2500 share, mostly he too would have got some more.


  Seniority does deserve some benefit of a doubt. You really need to speak to him first and try to understand the problem. He may be out of his depth, you may be able to help him, there could easily be variables you are unaware of. It may be hard now, but you could easily make the situation a lot worse by jumping the gun. 


I even does it, first his app wasn't handling multiple requests at a time, he was using a queue to handle the requests I sent to him. I even suggested to him some of my ideas on it. He said he already had these ideas, and will be executing them. His explanations was: ""Everything require certain time to do and this is a project which may need two years to complete and we are asked to finish it in two months"". I used to have a hard time coding during first few weeks because of this bug. But now he fixed it. But he is using a single queue for a user requests and that is now slowing down the app, since it processes one request at a time.


  What is QA doing this whole time? Why aren't they reporting/confirming the status of the project(s)?

Plan more flavor and context into your scenes, and your story.  WoD games often lend themselves to strong thematic overtones, so don't skimp.  Small side stories, or a growing tapestry of NPCs can both add a feeling of depth to the play experience.  As you write later scene, call back to those ""useless"" or ""flavor"" elements from earlier.  

These threads don't support the factual investigation story, but they support the emotional investment the players should develop.

1950,1950,3109,Does the function which sends a right angled triangle to its area produce infinitely many numbers having hardly any prime factors?,"Let $T$ be the set of pythagorean triples, that is, triples of integers (a,b,c) satisfying a2 + b2 = c2. We think of $T$ as the set of right angles triangles with integer lengths. And let $f : T \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}$ be the function $(a,b,c) \mapsto \frac{ab}{12}$ which computes the area of a triangle (divided by 6, which seems to always be a factor for some reason). 

I was wondering: what are the number theoretic propertires of $f$? It seems to produce numbers with few prime factors. What is the reason for this? For instance, $f(3,4,5) = 1$, $f(36,77,85) = 3 * 11 * 7$, and $f(65,72,97)=39*5*2$. Can we put a bound on the number of prime factors in the numbers that $f$ spits out? Or at least, can we give a 'generic' statement such as 'The output of $f$ almost always spits out numbers with less than 8 factors' or something?
",Bruce Bartlett,https://mathoverflow.net/users/401,"There are many right triangles whose area has as few prime factors as possible:

The Green-Tao paper ""Linear equations in primes"", and the subsequent work on their Mobius Nilsequences conjecture by GT and Gowers Inverse conjecture by GT-Ziegler, implies that $\frac{ab}{12}$ is infintely often a product of four primes, in a quantitative sense.  Indeed, reparametrizing gives $ab=12xy(2x+3y)(2x-3y)$, and now we are asking for points in the lattice $(1,0,2,2)\mathbb{Z}+(0,1,3,-3)\mathbb{Z}$ all of whose coordinates are prime.

We think of $T$ as the set of right angles triangles with integer lengths. And let $f : T \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}$ be the function $(a,b,c) \mapsto \frac{ab}{12}$ which computes the area of a triangle (divided by 6, which seems to always be a factor for some reason). 

I was wondering: what are the number theoretic propertires of $f$? It seems to produce numbers with few prime factors. What is the reason for this? For instance, $f(3,4,5) = 1$, $f(36,77,85) = 3 * 11 * 7$, and $f(65,72,97)=39*5*2$. Can we put a bound on the number of prime factors in the numbers that $f$ spits out? Or at least, can we give a 'generic' statement such as 'The output of $f$ almost always spits out numbers with less than 8 factors' or something?
","There are many right triangles whose area has as few prime factors as possible:

The Green-Tao paper ""Linear equations in primes"", and the subsequent work on their Mobius Nilsequences conjecture by GT and Gowers Inverse conjecture by GT-Ziegler, implies that $\frac{ab}{12}$ is infintely often a product of four primes, in a quantitative sense.  Indeed, reparametrizing gives $ab=12xy(2x+3y)(2x-3y)$, and now we are asking for points in the lattice $(1,0,2,2)\mathbb{Z}+(0,1,3,-3)\mathbb{Z}$ all of whose coordinates are prime.  This system has finite complexity and thus the main results of ""Linear equations in primes"" applies unconditionally, that is to say the number of pairs $(x,y)$ with $0 &lt; |x| , |y| &lt; T$ and $xy(2x+3y)(2x-3y)$ a product of four primes is asymptotically $cT^2 (\log{T})^{-4}$ for some constant $c$.

250,250,404,What are the pitfalls of buying a used car after an accident?,"I have the option to buy a car that has been in an accident. There are alternatives, but within my budget the alternatives are usually older/have higher mileage. The seller is a local mechanic who did the restoration work and also showed pictures of the car before restoration. The damage was done to one of the front headlights and to the surrounding bits. The mechanic has convinced me that no damage was done to the internal carrying structure. He fixed the lights and did some paintwork restoration.

Problem: I read that people advice not to buy cars after the accident. This is my first car, so my experience is nonexistent.

Question: What are the cons against buying a car after the accident?

As things stand at the moment, I assume it to be stating that the script consumes 67108864 bytes of data, but only 4000 bytes are available during runtime.

on line &lt;some line number&gt;


I'm a little embarrassed to state that even though I have figured out how to solve them and take steps to avoid them altogether, I'm still not quite sure what exactly does the message translate to in simple words.

For example, if I get a message such as:

Fatal error: Allowed memory size of 67108864 bytes exhausted (tried to allocate 4000 bytes) 
in ........ on line 34


As things stand at the moment, I assume it to be stating that the script consumes 67108864 bytes of data, but only 4000 bytes are available during runtime.


Am I right in my assumption?
If not, what's the correct interpretation?

","67108864 bytes are also known as 64 MiB (Mebibyte).
Many softwares like PHP still identifies 64 MB as 64 MiB, this is an historically grown issue.

4228,4228,6742,Tuples in LaTeX,"I am learning to use TikZ to draw things in LaTeX. One of the things that TikZ seems to use everywhere for specifying coordinates is a tuple.  For example,

\begin{tikzpicture}
  \node[isosceles triangle, isosceles triangle apex angle=70,
     draw=black,fill=white, inner sep=0pt,anchor=lower 
     side,rotate=90,draw=black,
     fill=white, minimum height=2 cm] (a) at (0,0) {};
\end{tikzpicture}


Creates a small isosceles triangle.  Note the use of (0,0).  Let's encapsulate making a triangle as above with the following macro.

\newcommand\Tri[3]{ 
  \node[isosceles triangle, isosceles triangle apex angle=70,
     draw=black,fill=white, inner sep=0pt,anchor=lower 
     side,rotate=90,draw=black,
     fill=white, minimum height={#2} cm] (#1) at #3 {};}


Suppose I wanted to define a function that takes in a size and starting coordinate, and draws a ""triangle"" of triangles such as

\begin{tikzpicture}
  \Tri{a}{1}{(-1,0)}
  \Tri{b}{1}{(1,0)}
  \Tri{c}{1}{(0,1.41)}
\end{tikzpicture}


The simple way to do this is to make a macro \TriTri, such that \TriTri{a}{n}{x}{y} creates a triangle of triangles, with bottom triangle anchored at (x,y).

\newcommand\TriTri[4]{ 
  \Tri{#1}{#2}{(#3,#4)}
  \Tri{#1}{#2}{(#3+2*#2,#4)}
  \Tri{#1}{#2}{(#3+#2,{sqrt(2*#2*#2)})}} %% note #3+#2 = (x1 + x2)/2 
                                         %% the sqrt bit is sqrt(size^2 + size^2)
}


I have gotten this to work! But what I would like to do is instead of having x and y input separately, I would like to have them input as a coordinate pair. I would like to reference the coordinates as \first,\second.  So that \first(x,y) = x. The desired effect is that

$$\first(1,2)$$


would be the same as

\begin{tikzpicture}
\TriTri{a}{3}(2,2)
\end{tikzpicture}

\end{document}


The \Tri command accepts three arguments; the first and the second ones are enclosed in braces, while the third is between parentheses, so

\Tri{a}{3}(0,0)


In the body of the definition you'll use (#3) instead of #3, because the parentheses are stripped off.

One of the things that TikZ seems to use everywhere for specifying coordinates is a tuple.  For example,

\begin{tikzpicture}
  \node[isosceles triangle, isosceles triangle apex angle=70,
     draw=black,fill=white, inner sep=0pt,anchor=lower 
     side,rotate=90,draw=black,
     fill=white, minimum height=2 cm] (a) at (0,0) {};
\end{tikzpicture}


Creates a small isosceles triangle.  Note the use of (0,0).  Let's encapsulate making a triangle as above with the following macro.

\newcommand\Tri[3]{ 
  \node[isosceles triangle, isosceles triangle apex angle=70,
     draw=black,fill=white, inner sep=0pt,anchor=lower 
     side,rotate=90,draw=black,
     fill=white, minimum height={#2} cm] (#1) at #3 {};}


Suppose I wanted to define a function that takes in a size and starting coordinate, and draws a ""triangle"" of triangles such as

\begin{tikzpicture}
  \Tri{a}{1}{(-1,0)}
  \Tri{b}{1}{(1,0)}
  \Tri{c}{1}{(0,1.41)}
\end{tikzpicture}


The simple way to do this is to make a macro \TriTri, such that \TriTri{a}{n}{x}{y} creates a triangle of triangles, with bottom triangle anchored at (x,y).

\newcommand\TriTri[4]{ 
  \Tri{#1}{#2}{(#3,#4)}
  \Tri{#1}{#2}{(#3+2*#2,#4)}
  \Tri{#1}{#2}{(#3+#2,{sqrt(2*#2*#2)})}} %% note #3+#2 = (x1 + x2)/2 
                                         %% the sqrt bit is sqrt(size^2 + size^2)
}


I have gotten this to work! But what I would like to do is instead of having x and y input separately, I would like to have them input as a coordinate pair. I would like to reference the coordinates as \first,\second.  So that \first(x,y) = x. The desired effect is that

$$\first(1,2)$$


would be the same as

$$1$$

","You can use the xparse package:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{tikz,xparse}
\usetikzlibrary{shapes.geometric}

\NewDocumentCommand{\Tri}{m m r()}
 {%
  \node[isosceles triangle, isosceles triangle apex angle=70,
     draw=black,fill=white, inner sep=0pt,anchor=lower
     side,rotate=90,draw=black,
     fill=white, minimum height=#2cm] (#1) at (#3) {};
 }

\NewDocumentCommand\TriTri{mmr(,u)}
 {%
  \Tri{#1}{#2}(#3,#4)
  \Tri{#1}{#2}(#3+2*#2,#4)
  \Tri{#1}{#2}(#3+#2,{sqrt(2*#2*#2)}) %% note #3+#2 = (x1 + x2)/2
                                      %% the sqrt bit is sqrt(size^2 + size^2)
 }

\begin{document}

\begin{tikzpicture}
\TriTri{a}{3}(2,2)
\end{tikzpicture}

\end{document}


The \Tri command accepts three arguments; the first and the second ones are enclosed in braces, while the third is between parentheses, so

\Tri{a}{3}(0,0)


In the body of the definition you'll use (#3) instead of #3, because the parentheses are stripped off.

In the case of \TriTri we have to split off the two coordinates, so we define four arguments; the first and the second ones are enclosed in braces; the third is what goes from ( to a comma, the final one is everything up to ).

Thus I have modified accordingly your code for \TriTri based on the requirements for \Tri.

275,275,441,does re-encrypting the same value with multiple keys reduce security,"I found myself wondering today, how much security is lost if you take a plaintext - assume that its content, including any metadata is unknown to an attacker, for example it may be random data - and encrypt it with multiple keys (not chained) and give all resulting ciphertexts to an attacker, how much higher is the probability of an attacker discovering the plaintext, vs only having a single ciphertext. 

An example:

Take plaintext $P_1$ and encrypt it with $K_1$, and send the resulting ciphertext $C_1$ to attacker $A_1$.

In addition: take the same plaintext $P_1$ and, and encrypt it with $K_1$, giving $C_1$. Then take $P_1$ and encrypt it with $K_2$ giving $C_2$, then $K_n$ giving $C_n$ and send all $n$ ciphertexts to attacker $A_2$.

",Zack Newsham,https://crypto.stackexchange.com/users/13023,"The ""security"" of an encryption scheme is commonly defined through a so called indistinguishability games, i.e. the attacker picks two messages of same length. You pick one of those two at random, encrypt it, and give it to the attacker. 
If the scheme is ""secure"", then the attacker's advantage of guessing which messages was encrypted should not be negligibly bigger than pure guessing, i.e. 1/2. This kind of security notion comes in different flavours like CPA, CCA1, and CCA2.

If a private or public key encryption scheme is secure against CPA, CCA1, or CCA2, then it will also be secure against the same games, where instead of giving two messages, the attacker gives you two message vectors and you encrypted one of them. This is proven with a standard technique called hybrid argument, which basically shows that if you can win a game with vectors of messages, then you can also win it where the attacker only outputs two messages.
Very roughly speaking you create a reduction, where your attacker guesses a position in the vector and inputs the challenge from the two message game. The probability of guessing the ""correct"" position in the vector is non-negligible if your vector is of polynomial length. There are plenty of books (e.g. the one by Katz &amp; Lindell) or online resources that explain this in depth, so I won't reiterate it here.

In short: If something is secure w.r.t. to for instance CPA, then it will also be secure if you obtain encrypted message vectors (or as you state where one message is encrypted under multiple different keys).

1296,1296,2041,Mercedes SLK (R170) convertible top/trunk release,"I have a 1999 Mercedes SLK 230 (R170), with an interesting combination of problems:

A)  The hydraulics for the convertible top are low (to the point where the top won't even start to open anymore),

B)  The trunk latch is disconnected internally, so the trunk can't be opened.

If the top were still working, it can be opened partway to access the back of the trunk latch, and operate it manually...  or if the trunk would open, I'd have access to the manual release for the top.  But the combination of these two means I have no way to open either now.

So:  Are there any other tricks I can use in this situation?

One possible idea:  If I tear out the headliner (which I'd probably have to cut away, since the screws are only accessible with the top out), and disconnect the lines coming from the hydraulic pump, would this allow the top to move by hand?  This seems plausible, but I don't want to destroy my headliner on a hunch...  But, the only other idea I have at this point is drilling a hole behind the license plate to get to the latch, so I'm hoping to find another solution.

A)  The hydraulics for the convertible top are low (to the point where the top won't even start to open anymore),

B)  The trunk latch is disconnected internally, so the trunk can't be opened.

If the top were still working, it can be opened partway to access the back of the trunk latch, and operate it manually...  or if the trunk would open, I'd have access to the manual release for the top.  But the combination of these two means I have no way to open either now.

So:  Are there any other tricks I can use in this situation?

One possible idea:  If I tear out the headliner (which I'd probably have to cut away, since the screws are only accessible with the top out), and disconnect the lines coming from the hydraulic pump, would this allow the top to move by hand?  This seems plausible, but I don't want to destroy my headliner on a hunch...  But, the only other idea I have at this point is drilling a hole behind the license plate to get to the latch, so I'm hoping to find another solution.

Such as being able to process lactose normally to having notice symptoms associated with the inability to process lactose.

I am not asking how long it takes to digest food, but rather how long it takes for lactose intolerance to become noticeable (hours, days, weeks, months, years).
",Chase,https://biology.stackexchange.com/users/4022,"Disclaimer: I am not medically qualified, and this answer must not be construed as being medical advice of any kind.

Primary adult hypolactasia is the most common cause of lactose intolerance. The majority of the world's population have this phenotype. 

In these individuals, at weaning, there is a reduction in the level of the enzyme lactase, which is responsible for digesting lactose to galactose and glucose in the small intestine. Undigested lactose can create symptoms via osmotic effects (causing diarrhoea) and because it is metabolised by bacteria in the colon, producing gas and thus abdominal bloating.

About 35% of adults have a genetic variant in an region upstream of the lactase gene which results in the expression of lactase continuing into adult life. These individuals are lactose tolerant. This trait is most common in Northern Europe.

According to references cited in  


  Ingram, CJE et al. (2009) Lactose digestion and the evolutionary genetics of lactase persistence Hum Genet (2009) 124:579–591 


(I have removed citations from the passage for clarity.)


  ""most lactase non-persistent individuals can tolerate small amounts of lactose (as in tea or coffee), and some can consume a lot without ill effects. Variation in the composition of the gut flora between individuals, as well as a psychosomatic component may account for some of the interindividual variation in symptoms.""


The clear implication is that there is a lot of variation in the tolerance of lactose amongst those lacking the lactase persistence trait. Given the contribution of the gut flora to the symptoms these could presumably vary as a result of, for example, antibiotic treatment. Also I imagine that the effects of undigested lactose could be synergistic with some other gut disturbance.

Added in response to comment from the OP:

In someone with the (common) genotype that corresponds to 'no persistence of lactase' the possibility of showing symptoms will be present from a young age. Apparently there is a lot of variation in the severity of symptoms. If an adult suddenly exhibits symptoms then I am suggesting that this could be due to an interaction of non-persistence with some other gut disturbance - I imagine this could happen quite quickly. Alternatively I suppose that a change in diet could trigger symptoms.

1240,1240,1946,Proportion of resources devoted to UX Design & Research vs. Software Development on a web app?,"First, some criteria:


The product is an application and is heavy on user interaction.  Think web 2.0 or mobile application, not a marketing or commerce site, or some back-end tool with only command-line access.
I realize that it is not always clear who is a UX person and who is a developer (nor should it be), so I'd like to focus on overall team resource allocation.  For instance, ""My team puts 25% of our resource-time into UX design/research vs. 75% of our resource-time in development.""  
I am not distinguishing between front-end and back-end development as it is too platform-specific and difficult to tease out the dividing like.  It's all software development for this question.
EDIT: Development is occurring in an agile-esque, ongoing manner, rather than a one-time, big-bang delivery.


So:


How does this proportion commonly look in practice?
How should it look?  Or, better yet, what has been the proportion on successful teams?

1485,1485,2336,Interpretation of riemannian geodesics in probability,"Good morning everybody. My question is, as maybe already hinted in the title, rather philosopic.

We know that geometric properties of a riemannian manifold can be interpreted in terms of certain evolution processes; I'm thinking about all the relations between the expansion of the heat kernel and, for example, the gaussian curvature of the manifold.

Now, since I'm not a probabilist the question is as follows...

are there characterizations, or properties of riemannian geodesics which can be deduced from stochastic operators (like the Brownian motion)? Even more, can we give a characterization of (properties of) riemannian geodesics in these terms?

All references are welcomed.. this is just a soft question for me to know where I have to look at in literature.

Students will bring me some plagiarized work, showing it to me early, as a sort of test if I will notice. It seems difficult to punish plagiarism when the paper is not yet submitted.
Students will bring in papers again and again, with little changes put in at each stage, hoping their minimal effort each time will be sufficient to reach their goal of a ""D"".


I've tried stopping students, but then they are angry when they see the ""F"" that they hoped I would help them get away from. While most of these students are probably just incredibly lazy, there is a chance that some among them are genuinely trying to improve, but just struggling a great deal, and I can't see it.

How might I go about blocking such abuses?
",Village,https://academia.stackexchange.com/users/600,"Another strategy is to provide more guidance about what sort of help you'll provide and how they should ask for it. Possibilities:


The first time you bring your paper to my office [or during specific dates], we will focus only on whether you have answered the question.
I will be happy to discuss aspects X and Y, but never Z.
Bring the rubric with you. Be prepared to explain which part of the
rubric you most need to address in your draft, and why. We'll focus on that part   of the rubric during our meeting.
Before you bring your paper to me, prepare a list of specific questions you would like me to answer. Bring two copies of the list, one for each of us.
Before you bring your paper to me, show it to someone at the writing center. Bring with you your notes from that visit and the draft you showed to them, along with the draft where you implemented those suggestions.
Always bring two copies of your draft--one for each of us. Be prepared to write  detailed notes on your copy. (Then you can keep your copy and you'll be able to bring it out the next time and say--ok, what did you change? Or you can compare it to the draft they turn in to see if they made significant changes. And if they plagiarised it, you'll have a record.)
Each time you show me your paper, I will expect you to create a checklist of things you will address. The next visit, you need to demonstrate that you have completed those things by bringing a draft with changes marked and annotated.


Another thing you can do is assign ""draft"" deadlines as well as final deadlines for everyone, then give the feedback you think is important on the drafts (maybe using a rubric) and not meet incessantly with a few students.

Another thing you can do--particularly with very structured papers that you have assigned before--is provide to the class a list of the common problems students have. Then when a student shows you a draft, you can initiate a discussion about which common problem the student thinks it illustrates and what can the student do to address it?

Another thing you can do is limit the number of times you will look at a draft, or the period of time during which you will look at a draft. 

I have had a similar problem with students wanting me to grade work before they turn it in for a grade--not just on writing, but with all kinds of assignments. Sometimes they are so lost they are completely stuck. Other times, they seem to be trying to minimize their workload by increasing mine. (""Just tell me in exacting  detail what to do, I'll do that and no more, you'll give me an A."") But what I want is for them to learn how to assess their own writing! 

Whatever strategy you use, when you meet with students, try to elicit their comments. If you give a suggestion, and they nod, then ask them how they expect to apply it. What changes will they make to a particular sentence or paragraph? Are there any other places in the text they should also make that change to--which ones, and why? If they are to provide more evidence, ask them where they intend to search and how. Then you can better assess whether they understand what you've told them and whether they can actually do it.

I often ask students about how they produced the draft. Which parts were the easiest and which parts were the hardest, and why? Which parts do they like best? Which parts do they think need the most revision? Sometimes I ask them to imagine a reader--if they were to show their paper to (mom, roommate, employer, etc.), which part would be the most controversial? What would need the most explanation? If their reader disagrees, what would that person likely argue back? The more they talk about their writing, the more opportunity you have to say, ""Yes! What you just said--write that down. Now do that!"" 

Another benefit of getting students to talk about their draft is that it is tough to talk about something you didn't write. If they let you know they copied passages, you can remind them (or explain how) to cite them properly. If they pretend they wrote every word, you have a different problem to address.

Or you can compare it to the draft they turn in to see if they made significant changes. And if they plagiarised it, you'll have a record.)
Each time you show me your paper, I will expect you to create a checklist of things you will address. The next visit, you need to demonstrate that you have completed those things by bringing a draft with changes marked and annotated.


Another thing you can do is assign ""draft"" deadlines as well as final deadlines for everyone, then give the feedback you think is important on the drafts (maybe using a rubric) and not meet incessantly with a few students.

Another thing you can do--particularly with very structured papers that you have assigned before--is provide to the class a list of the common problems students have. Then when a student shows you a draft, you can initiate a discussion about which common problem the student thinks it illustrates and what can the student do to address it?

Another thing you can do is limit the number of times you will look at a draft, or the period of time during which you will look at a draft. 

I have had a similar problem with students wanting me to grade work before they turn it in for a grade--not just on writing, but with all kinds of assignments. Sometimes they are so lost they are completely stuck. Other times, they seem to be trying to minimize their workload by increasing mine. (""Just tell me in exacting  detail what to do, I'll do that and no more, you'll give me an A."") But what I want is for them to learn how to assess their own writing! 

Whatever strategy you use, when you meet with students, try to elicit their comments. If you give a suggestion, and they nod, then ask them how they expect to apply it. What changes will they make to a particular sentence or paragraph? Are there any other places in the text they should also make that change to--which ones, and why? If they are to provide more evidence, ask them where they intend to search and how. Then you can better assess whether they understand what you've told them and whether they can actually do it.

I often ask students about how they produced the draft. Which parts were the easiest and which parts were the hardest, and why? Which parts do they like best? Which parts do they think need the most revision? Sometimes I ask them to imagine a reader--if they were to show their paper to (mom, roommate, employer, etc.), which part would be the most controversial? What would need the most explanation? If their reader disagrees, what would that person likely argue back? The more they talk about their writing, the more opportunity you have to say, ""Yes! What you just said--write that down. Now do that!"" 

Another benefit of getting students to talk about their draft is that it is tough to talk about something you didn't write. If they let you know they copied passages, you can remind them (or explain how) to cite them properly. If they pretend they wrote every word, you have a different problem to address.

4552,4552,7212,"Are DSLRs a dying breed, making now the time to switch to a mirrorless camera system?","I came across this thought provoking article on Stuck in Customs today that makes a strong case to hold off too much investment in DSLR gear, and instead switch to mirror-less cameras like the Sony NEX. The author prefers to call such cameras 3rd generation cameras to prevent any bias.

The crux of the argument lies in the smaller size and faster shooting speeds of the new cameras, while the sensor size is an area where they seem to be lacking (Sony &amp; Samsung cameras are APS-C sized though). Currently the big makers - Nikon &amp; Canon - have practically no presence in this market (Nikon seems to be doing something with the V1). However, they seem to have slowed down the introduction of new entry level DSLR models over the last year as well.

So, as DSLR users looking to build and enhance their kit (there are many like me who've jumped the bandwagon over the last couple of years, and are just starting to build their kit), what are the advantages of sticking with the DSLR system rather than switching to the 3rd gen cameras?

IMO, one point that could cause a massive switch in the DSLR base would be if Nikon &amp; Canon announced mirror-less models compatible with their current lens lineups, but that is a hypothetical scenario.

P.S. There is a similar question on mirror-less cameras, but that seems to be from the perspective of a person starting out rather than a person already invested in the DSLR system.
",ab.aditya,https://photo.stackexchange.com/users/1977,"DSLRs are certainly not going away any time soon, especially at the high end of the market - ruggedness, speed, large sensor size, and the continued availability of excellent glass will keep them around for some time. Large sensor cameras will also continue to appeal to nature photographers, as the 1.0x crop factor on the higher end models will allow them to shoot wider than APS-C, m4/3, or smaller sensored cameras, lens for lens.

That said, I believe that growth of the DSLR market will slow, perhaps even flattening, as I think there are two kinds of DSLR user - pros/enthusiasts who need specific feature sets and are willing to deal with larger size and weight, and people who want better than a point-and-shoot, who would prefer a smaller camera and get some of the benefits of a larger one (APS-C sensors, for example).

It's the latter group who will poach market share from both the DSLR and point-and-shoot market segments. Neither will be destroyed, but I believe both will lose some share.

As for me, I'm a long time SLR user, who's taking the plunge, selling his Nikon bodies and lenses, and going mirrorless (X-Pro1 when it drops). I think it will offer a compromise of features and size that will get me shooting more, because I'm carrying less. And the point is to be out there shooting, after all...

Does anyone know which is the safest/easiest way to go through?

If so, is travelling by bus the only way? I've heard there's also a train that leaves from Santa Cruz to Brazil, via Corumba? Is this currently running? Does anyone have experience travelling to Brazil like this?

The bus option looks brutal, however, as they're only finding one that goes via Argentina(!), taking 3 days. The train, on the other hand looks more doable for 43 hours, and looks to be split about 1/3 train 2/3 bus.

There is also a flight option shown.

If so, is travelling by bus the only way? I've heard there's also a train that leaves from Santa Cruz to Brazil, via Corumba? Is this currently running? Does anyone have experience travelling to Brazil like this?
","RometoRio shows a route for both bus and train.  Several, in fact.  Each varies by price, and time, for obvious reasons, and it's shown alongside some flight prices as well, if that's a possible consideration.

The bus option looks brutal, however, as they're only finding one that goes via Argentina(!), taking 3 days. The train, on the other hand looks more doable for 43 hours, and looks to be split about 1/3 train 2/3 bus.

2163,2163,3449,How do I deal with a slow and undedicated colleague in the team?,"I have been working on a new project. The project works like this: The end user can access a webapp using a link and he can add multiple systems on his network and manage that particular systems details. My part involves the front end and the webserver, which is done in python. My python actually communicates with another project which is entirely done in c &amp; c++. The c/c++ project is the main app which does all the functionality. My python sends the user request to it and displays the response from it to the user. 

I am very familiar with my work and I will finish it soon. Since that's not much work in it. And I am a person who loves to work. I spends most of the time in office and only go home when I feel sleepy.

The c/c++ app is managed by another colleague who has 5+ year experience and can do things much faster than me, but he never does it. May be he doesn't like to do it. His app crashes often when my python communicate with it or returns wrong values. It's full of bugs. Since my app depends on it, I am having a hard time building it. Instead of fixing the bugs, he asks me to slow down my work. He asks me to tell manager that my work needs a lot of time. He is asking me to fool the manager and even forcing me to work slowly like him.

During project meeting, when manager asks him about the bugs he says that he fixed everything and it works fine. Since he is my colleague, I couldn't tell anything to the manager. I obviously need to have a good relationship with my colleagues more than my manager, since most of the time we will be with our colleagues, not with the manager.

I am not able to tell the manager anything regarding this, since if manager asks him why, then he may think I complained about him to the manager. And he keeps on lying in the meeting. And since he fixes the bug slowly, it even slows down my work. Now I thought of working on the front-end part of my app  and finishing it off so that in the mean time he can make his project stable. Now he is asking me to tell the manager that my front end part require a lot of work and I may need more and more time, simply so that he can drag the project down. And the sad thing is our actual manager has gone to the US, so we have a temporary manager and this guy doesn't know about the project much, so the c,c++ just fools him.

Can anyone suggest me how I deal with this?
I wanted to finish off the project soon. How can I make him work even by maintaining a good relationship with him?

I am new to this company and the other guy has been there for many years. And I have just started knowing my colleagues. If I directly go and complaint him, I don't think so I can make good relationship with my other colleagues. Even he has the power to mislead them. I am not telling he is a bad guy, he can do the work, but he is not doing it.


  Doesn't your company have any kind of bug tracking system ? 


Here actual bug tracking system isn't there. The company tries to finish off the project as soon as possible and gives it to the QA. And then fixes the bugs reported by QA. 


  This is why companies should give employees stock / options or some sort of ownership. That way you can literally tell the guy ""You are costing me monetary growth... don't you want to make money also?"".


The company has the stock options they have given me a 2500 share, mostly he too would have got some more.


  Seniority does deserve some benefit of a doubt. You really need to speak to him first and try to understand the problem. He may be out of his depth, you may be able to help him, there could easily be variables you are unaware of. It may be hard now, but you could easily make the situation a lot worse by jumping the gun.

I used to have a hard time coding during first few weeks because of this bug. But now he fixed it. But he is using a single queue for a user requests and that is now slowing down the app, since it processes one request at a time.


  What is QA doing this whole time? Why aren't they reporting/confirming the status of the project(s)?

5097,5097,8105,how to resolve LM358's huge error as a current sense differential amplifier,"Ive built a current sense differential amplifier that measures the voltage across a 1 Ohm resistor to give me a reading for the current through it.

Ive connected it as follows, all resistors are matched 10K to give a gain of 1:



I am powering it from a single rail 12 volt source. The problem is even though this is a rail to rail opamp (Output Low swing from 5-20mv) im getting a constant error of 0.62v and it seems the opamp is not able to go below this value. 

I have tired to resolve this by connected Vout to ground using a 10K resistor but that makes no difference what so ever.

I tried it with dual supply configuration (+8v,-8v) and that seems to resolve the issue. But i want to run this off a single supply rail so this is not a viable option.

How can i resolve this? Im trying to measure the voltage drop across a 1ohm resistor to give me a reading for current through the circuit (0-1v represents 0-1 Amp) so i can set up a current limit. A better way (or practice) to doing this is also welcomed.The initial (but not ideal) fix i can think of is to offset the readings by a few volts?

Edit:

Changed R1-R4 from 10K to 100K and im down to about 30-50mv! 
",Adil Malik,https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/68900,"LM358 is not a rail-to-rail opamp (neither input nor output). 

The input CM range includes the negative rail and the output can swing close to the negative rail under the correct conditions, however this configuration passes current If to the output, and if that current exceeds (typically) about 50uA then the output can no longer swing all that close to the negative rail. This is all in the datasheet.

Your choices are to use a better op-amp (but it still will have to sink current so it can never get all the way to the negative rail) or create a negative supply. Up to you.

I am powering it from a single rail 12 volt source. The problem is even though this is a rail to rail opamp (Output Low swing from 5-20mv) im getting a constant error of 0.62v and it seems the opamp is not able to go below this value. 

I have tired to resolve this by connected Vout to ground using a 10K resistor but that makes no difference what so ever.

I tried it with dual supply configuration (+8v,-8v) and that seems to resolve the issue. But i want to run this off a single supply rail so this is not a viable option.

How can i resolve this? Im trying to measure the voltage drop across a 1ohm resistor to give me a reading for current through the circuit (0-1v represents 0-1 Amp) so i can set up a current limit. A better way (or practice) to doing this is also welcomed.The initial (but not ideal) fix i can think of is to offset the readings by a few volts?

Edit:

Changed R1-R4 from 10K to 100K and im down to about 30-50mv! 
","LM358 is not a rail-to-rail opamp (neither input nor output). 

The input CM range includes the negative rail and the output can swing close to the negative rail under the correct conditions, however this configuration passes current If to the output, and if that current exceeds (typically) about 50uA then the output can no longer swing all that close to the negative rail. This is all in the datasheet.

Your choices are to use a better op-amp (but it still will have to sink current so it can never get all the way to the negative rail) or create a negative supply. Up to you.

The project works like this: The end user can access a webapp using a link and he can add multiple systems on his network and manage that particular systems details. My part involves the front end and the webserver, which is done in python. My python actually communicates with another project which is entirely done in c &amp; c++. The c/c++ project is the main app which does all the functionality. My python sends the user request to it and displays the response from it to the user. 

I am very familiar with my work and I will finish it soon. Since that's not much work in it. And I am a person who loves to work. I spends most of the time in office and only go home when I feel sleepy.

The c/c++ app is managed by another colleague who has 5+ year experience and can do things much faster than me, but he never does it. May be he doesn't like to do it. His app crashes often when my python communicate with it or returns wrong values. It's full of bugs. Since my app depends on it, I am having a hard time building it. Instead of fixing the bugs, he asks me to slow down my work. He asks me to tell manager that my work needs a lot of time. He is asking me to fool the manager and even forcing me to work slowly like him.

During project meeting, when manager asks him about the bugs he says that he fixed everything and it works fine. Since he is my colleague, I couldn't tell anything to the manager. I obviously need to have a good relationship with my colleagues more than my manager, since most of the time we will be with our colleagues, not with the manager.

I am not able to tell the manager anything regarding this, since if manager asks him why, then he may think I complained about him to the manager. And he keeps on lying in the meeting. And since he fixes the bug slowly, it even slows down my work. Now I thought of working on the front-end part of my app  and finishing it off so that in the mean time he can make his project stable. Now he is asking me to tell the manager that my front end part require a lot of work and I may need more and more time, simply so that he can drag the project down. And the sad thing is our actual manager has gone to the US, so we have a temporary manager and this guy doesn't know about the project much, so the c,c++ just fools him.

Can anyone suggest me how I deal with this?
I wanted to finish off the project soon. How can I make him work even by maintaining a good relationship with him?

  If he's really deliberately misleading the company, you should report him to management.


I am new to this company and the other guy has been there for many years. And I have just started knowing my colleagues. If I directly go and complaint him, I don't think so I can make good relationship with my other colleagues. Even he has the power to mislead them. I am not telling he is a bad guy, he can do the work, but he is not doing it.


  Doesn't your company have any kind of bug tracking system ? 


Here actual bug tracking system isn't there. The company tries to finish off the project as soon as possible and gives it to the QA. And then fixes the bugs reported by QA. 


  This is why companies should give employees stock / options or some sort of ownership. That way you can literally tell the guy ""You are costing me monetary growth... don't you want to make money also?"".


The company has the stock options they have given me a 2500 share, mostly he too would have got some more.


  Seniority does deserve some benefit of a doubt. You really need to speak to him first and try to understand the problem. He may be out of his depth, you may be able to help him, there could easily be variables you are unaware of. It may be hard now, but you could easily make the situation a lot worse by jumping the gun. 


I even does it, first his app wasn't handling multiple requests at a time, he was using a queue to handle the requests I sent to him. I even suggested to him some of my ideas on it. He said he already had these ideas, and will be executing them. His explanations was: ""Everything require certain time to do and this is a project which may need two years to complete and we are asked to finish it in two months"". I used to have a hard time coding during first few weeks because of this bug. But now he fixed it. But he is using a single queue for a user requests and that is now slowing down the app, since it processes one request at a time.


  What is QA doing this whole time? Why aren't they reporting/confirming the status of the project(s)? 


The manager is the person who decides when to give to the QA. As of now it has not yet given to QA. He said we should give it by this month end.

You absolutely can and should make sure your manager knows the truth, even if your co-worker is lying to his face. If you don't want to say anything in a meeting with all 3 of you in the room, that's totally understandable. But you should at least pull your manager (the real one, not just the temp) aside and let them know that your work is almost done and is waiting on bug fixes from the other developer's end before the whole application is ready for prime-time. Don't accuse your co-worker of lying, but don't sit there and let your boss operate with incomplete information. 

Report your statuses honestly. If your work is being held up by bugs on another developer's end, document that you've found bugs in the C/C++ and have reported them (please tell me you're using some form of documentation that leaves a paper trail). 

In the meantime, go ahead and wrap up your work, and let your boss know when you're done. If your manager wants to know why the rest of the project isn't up and running yet, you can refer him to the other developer, and maybe mention that it's probably very complicated/large/requires a lot of testing/other developer is very busy/etc. If you know C/C++, you can offer to help on the main application logic to get things moving with that as well. Yes, you'll be doing the other guy's work, but it makes it clear that you're the employee working hard and being productive, and the other guy isn't, not to mention making you even more valuable to your boss. It may even put some pressure on the other developer to step things up and get them done quicker.

For lower frequencies (but not necessarily nA current consumption) many silicon oscillators, frequency synthesizers, PLLs, or real time clocks include internal clock divider circuitry and can be used to generate clocks as ""slow"" as 1 Hz.

So, he talks about the fugues, sonatas and partitas, modulation, themes played against themselves, how Bach manages to get two or more musical lines going simultaneously and so on.

So how can I learn more about these musical concepts, so as to better follow the book's main ideas?

",Otavio Macedo,https://music.stackexchange.com/users/12666,"As someone who has no formal training in music whatsoever but who fell in love with Beethoven and Bach upon hearing them, I discovered that my visual senses are much better at picking out patterns than my auditory senses.

Sometimes just visually looking at what's being played is all you need. The patterns are just so obvious when you hear them AND see them. In this case you'll see what a fugue is and a few of the things Bach is doing with the main melody. You will quite literally see the individual voices.

Here is his Fugue BWV 565. In general I recommend any MIDI viewing program and then you can get free MIDIs (for example here), open them up in your favorite MIDI viewer and view the piano roll. There are plenty of paid ones of course but the one I like is called Synthesia which has a pretty good free version and it does everything I need it for. And here is a sample of what Synthesia does.

129,129,204,What is the best way for a user to select an item by unique identifier?,"My team and I are building a mobile app where the user will need to input a human-readable unique identifier (the serial number) of a single unit of inventory. Our system tracks the serial numbers that the user can access. We have considered three possible input modes:

1. We show the user the entire list of serial numbers they can access and allow him to select one from the list (like how a select element would work on an HTML page).

Pros:


The user doesn't have to type anything in.
The user can't enter an invalid serial number.


Cons:


The list is likely to be overwhelmingly large.
The serial numbers usually have the same format and are often sequential, so it might be hard to read the list.
Data usage for downloading the entire list of serial numbers


2. We allow the user to start entering the serial number in a text input and have an auto-suggest drop-down with a filtered list of serial numbers the user can access.

Pros:


The user doesn't have to type in a complete serial number.
The user is unlikely to enter an invalid serial number.
Smaller list to choose from than Option 1.


Cons:


The serial numbers usually have the same format and are often sequential, so it might be hard to read the list.
Auto-suggest may have limited value since the unit has a barcode that we could read.
Data usage for downloading a sizable list of serial numbers


3. We require the entire serial number to be entered, and once we recognize the correct number of characters, we validate the serial number against the user's accessible list and show feedback.

Pros:


The unit has a barcode that we could read, so this has the potential to be simpler than an auto-suggest or select-from-list paradigm.
Simpler implementation
Significantly reduced data usage vs. Option 1 and Option 2


Cons:


The unit has multiple barcodes, so it might take a couple of tries for the user to capture the correct one.
Typing manually would be tedious if the camera is unavailable or barcode scanner isn't working for whatever reason (lighting, etc.)


Which of these three is the best approach? Is there a better approach than what we have considered?
",Nick Saunders,https://ux.stackexchange.com/users/50391,"We provide retail and stock control systems so accurate capture of barcodes and serial numbers at high speed is important to us. For what its worth, here's what we do, but our target market might be slightly different to yours.

Use a barcode scanner. There are bluetooth ones that interface easily to most mobile devices. Of course this costs the end user money so might not be an option.

Allow use of camera to capture barcode and/or OCR. Not that hard programming wise but is not actually that fast overall. Good for consumers but not a receiving dock. (Nb quality of cameras varies by device, so this does not work for all devices) Despite some drawbacks for high volume use, cameras do allow us to keep a photo as proof of entry forever, which is useful.

If keyboard entry is required, we present a text box input and display a series of tiles with valid options that can be pressed.  The list of tiles changes dynamically on every keystroke. We find the tiles are better than a classic drop list as (a) bigger and easier to press (b) let us display a bit more info such as description (c) have more options to colour code the background as a signal too.

Personally I would not just display a list of barcodes, try and display something else to help the user. As DaveAlger says in his answer barcodes and serial numbers aren't designed for humans. Display a product description, date it was first seen, anything.

For barcodes, the most useful parts are generally the first and last few characters. We allow users to enter any characters they can see in the barcode, skipping whatever they wish. They just cannot jumble the order.  If you are using sql, and my input is ""9412"" then the query is something like 

 Select ... From barcodes where barcode like '%9%4%1%2%'


Rather than the typically used

 Select ... From barcodes where barcode like '9412%'


Once users learn this, and it isn't obvious I admit, they really appreciate it.  Try reading 94100000000192 and entering it correctly. This technique means I can just enter 941192 and picklist will show it.

(Actually, we use both the above sql queries with the second sql doing the first half the results and the other doing all remaining gaps. This is to ensure the order looks right to users, but the second sql quickly resolves to no records as users enter more characters.)

We put a lot of effort into making the pick list tiles as relevant as possible, eg if you just used supplier #1, then barcodes from supplier number #1 have higher priority. Not sure this will be possible for you, but sometimes it is.  Imagine you are entering serial numbers of watches. After the user has entered ""9412"", you may know that the only brands possible (with 9412) are Seiko and Swatch, so two buttons appear on the pick list to select these as an additional filter if the user wishes. Lots of work to make this seemless, but for us 1/4 second and less friction from user entry is worth the effort.

Assume the average cold water supply temperature is 58.7°F. The tank will be set at 140°F, to avoid Legionella. The tank recovery is typical of a natural gas heater, so it can recover its volume in an hour (40 gph in this case).

Assume the recovery time is not dependent on temperature and completely accounts for insulation losses and the like. Neglect losses in pipes and assume the operator controls the shower temperature to 105°F perfectly. Taking the stopping criterion from the question, the shower is over when the water in the tank becomes 105°F.

The recovery rate raises 140 gallons of water by 81.3°F in one hour. We'll say this is a constant heat input of 9118 W.

The difference is 7868.5 W. With constant heat, you don't need any complicated integrals.



The time for the tank to drop from 140°F to 105°F is 1568 s or 26 minutes.

The (maybe counterintuitive) fact that the variable flow rate from the water heater does not influence the rate of heat removal from the water heater comes from the fact that the incoming cold water is the same temperature at the shower and at the water heater.

Thanks,
","You should not try to hard-code the URL to the item in the menu item edit screen.

You should add a View to your Menu.

Views allows you create a view including a filter to show only recent content.

4190,4190,6682,Why do I have house flies in my carport?,"I bought my home in early September 2012. I noticed that flies were flocking around a light in my open air carport whether it was on or off. I tried a few products like fly tape, spray and a fly trap. Still no results. This continued through fall until temps dropped. This Spring I thought I would take preventive measures and cleaned my entire carport with Lysol including my garbage cans which are new. But still flies are flocking around this light. Its strange, they don't land on it that much as if there were some food source. They just fly around it all day until the sun goes down and even then there are a few stragglers. I would say at peak during the day there are about 150 to 200 flies. Why are they attracted to this area and What do I do to get rid of them?

",Marky,https://drupal.stackexchange.com/users/17882,"""Drupal way"" is to collaborate, not compete. It means that anyone wanting to write his own cloning solution will be asked to cooperate with author of existing one to provide what he finds lacking. Only if that's not possible, and some basic differences in approach or expected results are found, community will welcome new module. Otherwise it'll just die silently, unloved.

That said, you can use node exporting and importing tools to export nodes, edit them or not and import again, possibly under new nid. Node export is example of modules that can do that. Probably there are other ways to get content duplicated, and if you can think of basically different scenario, there is a big chance someone got that implemented.

2811,2811,4476,Does the function which sends a right angled triangle to its area produce infinitely many numbers having hardly any prime factors?,"Let $T$ be the set of pythagorean triples, that is, triples of integers (a,b,c) satisfying a2 + b2 = c2. We think of $T$ as the set of right angles triangles with integer lengths. And let $f : T \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}$ be the function $(a,b,c) \mapsto \frac{ab}{12}$ which computes the area of a triangle (divided by 6, which seems to always be a factor for some reason). 

I was wondering: what are the number theoretic propertires of $f$? It seems to produce numbers with few prime factors. What is the reason for this? For instance, $f(3,4,5) = 1$, $f(36,77,85) = 3 * 11 * 7$, and $f(65,72,97)=39*5*2$. Can we put a bound on the number of prime factors in the numbers that $f$ spits out? Or at least, can we give a 'generic' statement such as 'The output of $f$ almost always spits out numbers with less than 8 factors' or something?
",Bruce Bartlett,https://mathoverflow.net/users/401,"Presumably, there are infinitely many primes $p$, $q$, such that $p+q$ is 6 times a prime and $p-q$ is 4 times a prime (e.g., $73+5=6\times13$, $73-5=4\times17$). This ought to follow from the prime $k$-tuples conjecture. Proving it is another matter.

We think of $T$ as the set of right angles triangles with integer lengths. And let $f : T \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}$ be the function $(a,b,c) \mapsto \frac{ab}{12}$ which computes the area of a triangle (divided by 6, which seems to always be a factor for some reason). 

I was wondering: what are the number theoretic propertires of $f$? It seems to produce numbers with few prime factors. What is the reason for this? For instance, $f(3,4,5) = 1$, $f(36,77,85) = 3 * 11 * 7$, and $f(65,72,97)=39*5*2$. Can we put a bound on the number of prime factors in the numbers that $f$ spits out? Or at least, can we give a 'generic' statement such as 'The output of $f$ almost always spits out numbers with less than 8 factors' or something?
","Presumably, there are infinitely many primes $p$, $q$, such that $p+q$ is 6 times a prime and $p-q$ is 4 times a prime (e.g., $73+5=6\times13$, $73-5=4\times17$). This ought to follow from the prime $k$-tuples conjecture. Proving it is another matter.

http://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/1118/roleplaying-games/three-clue-rule

As Alexandrian says, have at least three clues per thing that you want the players to figure out. And as Bankuei says, make at least some of them obvious. Generally I use two tiers when making a mystery. There are three first tier clues that point to the person/location/thing that the players need to run into. But when the players enter the mystery, what they find first are second tier clues to the first tier clues or places they can find other second tier clues.

So lets say we have a murder mystery. We come up with three first tier clues: the guy who acted as lookout while the murder was committed, the murder weapon, and the fact that the two victims knew the murderer.

We decide that we have three second tier sources of clues: The two crime scenes, and the CCTV network that one player has access to.

At the first crime scene are stab wounds that will match the murder weapon, a witness who saw the lookout and can describe him, and the matchbooks that the lookout dropped at his lookout point, which points to his favorite bar.

At the second crime scene are stab wounds that will match the murder weapon, a witness who saw where the murderer disposed of the murder weapon, and a series of emails between the murdered and murderer which shows they had business ties.

The CCTV network will show the outlook at the second crime scene, and the fact that the murderer frequently visited both victims. He looked very angry when he visited the second victim before the day before the murder.

To shore up the outlook clues, we'll also decide that the outlook is a petty crook, so his name and address can be found by finding him in the criminal database (if they know what he looks like).

Finally our first tier clues: The murder weapon has the murderer's finger prints and his initials on the grip.

The outlook can be made to spill the beans. He knows exactly who the murderer is.

And digging into the emails and other records will reveal that the three were engaged in shady business deals, where the murderer was getting the short end of the stick.

I noticed a few things that I think ought to help run a mystery game. (Life has gotten in the way of testing my theories in the game I was to run, so do report back if any of this helps!)

First, a mystery is not a confusing story--it's a simple story about a perpetrator, a victim, and a crime scene, that the characters learn out of sequence. Supposing we're talking about a murder, there is a victim, and there is physical evidence. The detectives will have physical evidence to check out, and they'll want to learn about the social network that the victim was a part of. The clues and interviewees lead to more places to look for more evidence. 

Bringing me to the second point: the detectives spend as much time or more ruling possibilities out than learning about them. The common problem GMs face is not wanting to give out too much information; I suspect that the thing to do is give out a good amount of information that looks suspicious, so that the characters turn up new evidence while ruling out suspects.

named NPCs who act suspiciously and lie to the PCs, but because they are concealing a secret that doesn't directly relate to the crime;
a perpetrator who seems like they can be ruled out, but whose guilt will be revealed when facts that come up while the PCs are ruling things out show the motive, means, and opportunity of this perpetrator. Justice is served, etc. etc.


Like I said, these are theories that haven't been borne out by play.

2632,2632,4185,KL divergence between two univariate Gaussians,"I need to determine the KL-divergence between two Gaussians. I am comparing my results to these, but I can't reproduce their result. My result is obviously wrong, because the KL is not 0 for KL(p, p).

I wonder where I am doing a mistake and ask if anyone can spot it.

Let $p(x) = N(\mu_1, \sigma_1)$ and $q(x) = N(\mu_2, \sigma_2)$. From Bishop's
PRML I know that

$$KL(p, q) = - \int p(x) \log q(x) dx + \int p(x) \log p(x) dx$$

where integration is done over all real line, and that

$$\int p(x) \log p(x) dx = \frac{1}{2} (1 + \log 2 \pi \sigma_1^2),$$

so I restrict myself to $\int p(x) \log q(x) dx$, which I can write out as

$$-\int p(x) \log \frac{1}{(2 \pi \sigma_2^2)^{(1/2)}} e^{-\frac{(x-\mu_2)^2}{2 \sigma_2^2}} dx,$$

which I can separate into

$$\frac{1}{2} \log (2 \pi \sigma_2^2) - \int p(x) \log e^{-\frac{(x-\mu_2)^2}{2 \sigma_2^2}} dx.$$

Taking the log I get

$$\frac{1}{2} \log (2 \pi \sigma_2^2) - \int p(x) -\frac{(x-\mu_2)^2}{2 \sigma_2^2} dx,$$

where I separate the sums and get $\sigma_2^2$ out of the integral.

$$\frac{1}{2} \log (2 \pi \sigma_2^2) + \frac{\int p(x) x^2 dx - \int p(x) 2x\mu dx + \int p(x) \mu^2 dx}{2 \sigma_2^2}$$

Letting $\langle \rangle$ denote the expectation operator under $p$, I can rewrite this as

$$\frac{1}{2} \log (2 \pi \sigma_2^2) + \frac{\langle x^2 \rangle - 2 \langle x \rangle \mu_2 + \mu_2^2}{2 \sigma_2^2}.$$

We know that $var(x) = \langle x^2 \rangle - \langle x \rangle ^2$. Thus 

$$\langle x^2 \rangle = \sigma_1^2 + \mu_1^2$$

and therefore

$$\frac{1}{2} \log (2 \pi \sigma^2) + \frac{\sigma_1^2 + \mu_1^2 - 2 \mu_1 \mu_2 + \mu_2^2}{2 \sigma_2^2},$$

which I can put as

$$\frac{1}{2} \log (2 \pi \sigma_2^2) + \frac{\sigma_1^2 + (\mu_1 - \mu_2)^2}{2 \sigma_2^2}.$$

Putting everything together, I get to 

\begin{align*}
KL(p, q) &amp;= - \int p(x) \log q(x) dx + \int p(x) \log p(x) dx\\
&amp;= \frac{1}{2} \log (2 \pi \sigma_2^2) + \frac{\sigma_1^2 + (\mu_1 - \mu_2)^2}{2 \sigma_2^2} - \frac{1}{2} (1 + \log 2 \pi \sigma_1^2)\\
&amp;= \log \frac{\sigma_2}{\sigma_1} + \frac{\sigma_1^2 + (\mu_1 - \mu_2)^2}{2 \sigma_2^2}.
\end{align*}
Which is wrong since it equals $1$ for two identical Gaussians.

Can anyone spot my error?

Update

Thanks to mpiktas for clearing things up. The correct answer is:

$KL(p, q) = \log \frac{\sigma_2}{\sigma_1} + \frac{\sigma_1^2 + (\mu_1 - \mu_2)^2}{2 \sigma_2^2} - \frac{1}{2}$

I am comparing my results to these, but I can't reproduce their result. My result is obviously wrong, because the KL is not 0 for KL(p, p).

I wonder where I am doing a mistake and ask if anyone can spot it.

Let $p(x) = N(\mu_1, \sigma_1)$ and $q(x) = N(\mu_2, \sigma_2)$. From Bishop's
PRML I know that

$$KL(p, q) = - \int p(x) \log q(x) dx + \int p(x) \log p(x) dx$$

where integration is done over all real line, and that

$$\int p(x) \log p(x) dx = \frac{1}{2} (1 + \log 2 \pi \sigma_1^2),$$

so I restrict myself to $\int p(x) \log q(x) dx$, which I can write out as

$$-\int p(x) \log \frac{1}{(2 \pi \sigma_2^2)^{(1/2)}} e^{-\frac{(x-\mu_2)^2}{2 \sigma_2^2}} dx,$$

which I can separate into

$$\frac{1}{2} \log (2 \pi \sigma_2^2) - \int p(x) \log e^{-\frac{(x-\mu_2)^2}{2 \sigma_2^2}} dx.$$

Taking the log I get

$$\frac{1}{2} \log (2 \pi \sigma_2^2) - \int p(x) -\frac{(x-\mu_2)^2}{2 \sigma_2^2} dx,$$

where I separate the sums and get $\sigma_2^2$ out of the integral.

$$\frac{1}{2} \log (2 \pi \sigma_2^2) + \frac{\int p(x) x^2 dx - \int p(x) 2x\mu dx + \int p(x) \mu^2 dx}{2 \sigma_2^2}$$

Letting $\langle \rangle$ denote the expectation operator under $p$, I can rewrite this as

$$\frac{1}{2} \log (2 \pi \sigma_2^2) + \frac{\langle x^2 \rangle - 2 \langle x \rangle \mu_2 + \mu_2^2}{2 \sigma_2^2}.$$

We know that $var(x) = \langle x^2 \rangle - \langle x \rangle ^2$. Thus 

$$\langle x^2 \rangle = \sigma_1^2 + \mu_1^2$$

and therefore

$$\frac{1}{2} \log (2 \pi \sigma^2) + \frac{\sigma_1^2 + \mu_1^2 - 2 \mu_1 \mu_2 + \mu_2^2}{2 \sigma_2^2},$$

which I can put as

$$\frac{1}{2} \log (2 \pi \sigma_2^2) + \frac{\sigma_1^2 + (\mu_1 - \mu_2)^2}{2 \sigma_2^2}.$$

Putting everything together, I get to 

\begin{align*}
KL(p, q) &amp;= - \int p(x) \log q(x) dx + \int p(x) \log p(x) dx\\
&amp;= \frac{1}{2} \log (2 \pi \sigma_2^2) + \frac{\sigma_1^2 + (\mu_1 - \mu_2)^2}{2 \sigma_2^2} - \frac{1}{2} (1 + \log 2 \pi \sigma_1^2)\\
&amp;= \log \frac{\sigma_2}{\sigma_1} + \frac{\sigma_1^2 + (\mu_1 - \mu_2)^2}{2 \sigma_2^2}.
\end{align*}
Which is wrong since it equals $1$ for two identical Gaussians.

Can anyone spot my error?

Update

Thanks to mpiktas for clearing things up. The correct answer is:

$KL(p, q) = \log \frac{\sigma_2}{\sigma_1} + \frac{\sigma_1^2 + (\mu_1 - \mu_2)^2}{2 \sigma_2^2} - \frac{1}{2}$
","I did not have a look at your calculation but here is mine with a lot of details. 
Suppose $p$ is the density of a normal random variable with mean $\mu_1$ and variance $\sigma^2_1$, and that $q$ is the density of a normal random variable with mean $\mu_2$ and variance $\sigma^2_2$. 
The Kullback-Leibler distance from $q$ to $p$ is:

$\int \left[\log( p(x)) - log( q(x)) \right] p(x) dx$

$=\int \left[ -\frac{1}{2} \log(2\pi) - \log(\sigma_1) - \frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{x-\mu_1}{\sigma_1}\right)^2 + \frac{1}{2}\log(2\pi) + \log(\sigma_2) + \frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{x-\mu_2}{\sigma_2}\right)^2  \right]$
$\times \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}\sigma_1} \exp\left[-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{x-\mu_1}{\sigma_1}\right)^2\right] dx$

$=\int \left\{\log\left(\frac{\sigma_2}{\sigma_1}\right) + \frac{1}{2} \left[ \left(\frac{x-\mu_2}{\sigma_2}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{x-\mu_1}{\sigma_1}\right)^2 \right] \right\}$
$\times \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}\sigma_1} \exp\left[-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{x-\mu_1}{\sigma_1}\right)^2\right] dx$

$=E_{1} \left\{\log\left(\frac{\sigma_2}{\sigma_1}\right) + \frac{1}{2} \left[ \left(\frac{x-\mu_2}{\sigma_2}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{x-\mu_1}{\sigma_1}\right)^2 \right]\right\}$

$=\log\left(\frac{\sigma_2}{\sigma_1}\right) + \frac{1}{2\sigma_2^2} E_1 \left\{(X-\mu_2)^2\right\} - \frac{1}{2\sigma_1^2} E_1 \left\{(X-\mu_1)^2\right\}$ 

$=\log\left(\frac{\sigma_2}{\sigma_1}\right) + \frac{1}{2\sigma_2^2} E_1 \left\{(X-\mu_2)^2\right\} - \frac{1}{2}$

(Now note that $(X - \mu_2)^2 = (X-\mu_1+\mu_1-\mu_2)^2 = (X-\mu_1)^2 + 2(X-\mu_1)(\mu_1-\mu_2) + (\mu_1-\mu_2)^2$)

$=\log\left(\frac{\sigma_2}{\sigma_1}\right) + \frac{1}{2\sigma_2^2}
\left[E_1\left\{(X-\mu_1)^2\right\} + 2(\mu_1-\mu_2)E_1\left\{X-\mu_1\right\} + (\mu_1-\mu_2)^2\right] - \frac{1}{2}$

$=\log\left(\frac{\sigma_2}{\sigma_1}\right) + \frac{\sigma_1^2 + (\mu_1-\mu_2)^2}{2\sigma_2^2} - \frac{1}{2}$

That got me thinking. While I know that Germanic languages have greatly influenced English, so have the Latin and Celtic ones (and various others to a greater or lesser degree). Is it true that more than 50% of the English vocabulary is derived from Germanic roots?

Ideally I would like to see this expressed in terms of % of words but I am aware that, at least to some linguists, attempting to quantify vocabulary is anathema (to give a simple reason, all languages that allow number construction have an infinite  vocabulary by definition), so alternative approaches to quantifying this are also welcome.

Random errors caused by Th>Tpd are not really visible and go undetected. If I connect another shift register in series from a different technology, which requires longer hold times, the circuit won't work, no matter how slow clock I chose.

",jmac,https://meta.stackexchange.com/users/209637,"Well, I can tell you what I hoped for when I was a regular user on a tiny site: network-wide exposure. When Biblical Hermeneutics showed up in the hot question list, I vividly recall day-dreaming that everyone who had an interest in the Bible on the network would see our little site and have a burning desire to ask and answer hermeneutics questions.  It was a good feeling to know that Jack's question and the answers it had already accumulated would get some exposure. It felt like our little community had earned a collective gold star.

Now I'll admit it was a bigger deal in my mind than it was in reality.  As of this writing, the question has fewer than 600 views. It's not anywhere to be found on the first page of BH's Greatest Hits. Likely we didn't get even one new user out of the deal. And we certainly didn't have any crowd control problems. But you know what? I'm still proud of our little community and that question. There aren't a lot of achievements a site can earn from the time pro tem moderators are appointed until graduation, but having a ""hot question"" is one of them.

Back then, it wasn't as easy to find network-wide hot questions. Now that they are listed in the sidebar, it's not uncommon for me to wander over to a site I'd forgotten even existed.  (Hello, Code Golf!) Ideally, I will find a question that isn't just entertaining to read, but also sparks my interest in writing something. There are some brilliant, eloquent, and thoughtful people on our sites, so I think some cross-pollination can strengthen the whole network.

The other day, I was looking into the RPG site and trying to figure out how it got a healthy bump in visitors since the beginning of the year. As I dug, it became clear that one factor has been direct traffic from other sites on the network. Digging a bit more, I turned up a series of ""hot questions"" such as Is 3d6 the same as 1d18? Since you don't have to be an expert in a particular RPG system to read, appreciate, or even answer this question, it attracted considerable attention (11,377 views so far). Site traffic also spiked noticeably the week the question was asked.

It was not without pain: two answers were deleted and the voting seems disproportionate. Arguably the question is not even on topic, yet it's tied for 26th on the all-time best questions list. While the answers tend to be good, none of them demonstrate any particular RPG expertise. But the question also got two solid first answers (one from Eric Lippert and the other from someone who has provided an equally upvoted answer). All-in-all, the HQ list looks like a net positive on that site. 

Speaking of rolling the dice, hot questions are a sort of gamble. They take advantage of the blockbuster business model. Every day there are dozens of new hot questions. Some of them blow up and others fizzle. Most sites consider it a great success to convert just one reader in a hundred (or even a thousand) into an occasional contributor. The hot question formula improves the odds by taking into account indicators of interest and quality signalled by regular users of the site. In other words, if lots of people on a site read, answer, and vote on posts, we can feel pretty confident that showing the question around will attract similar people.

How can that space best be used if not on a list of questions picked by an arbitrary algorithm?
","Well, I can tell you what I hoped for when I was a regular user on a tiny site: network-wide exposure. When Biblical Hermeneutics showed up in the hot question list, I vividly recall day-dreaming that everyone who had an interest in the Bible on the network would see our little site and have a burning desire to ask and answer hermeneutics questions.  It was a good feeling to know that Jack's question and the answers it had already accumulated would get some exposure. It felt like our little community had earned a collective gold star.

Now I'll admit it was a bigger deal in my mind than it was in reality.  As of this writing, the question has fewer than 600 views. It's not anywhere to be found on the first page of BH's Greatest Hits. Likely we didn't get even one new user out of the deal. And we certainly didn't have any crowd control problems. But you know what? I'm still proud of our little community and that question. There aren't a lot of achievements a site can earn from the time pro tem moderators are appointed until graduation, but having a ""hot question"" is one of them.

Back then, it wasn't as easy to find network-wide hot questions. Now that they are listed in the sidebar, it's not uncommon for me to wander over to a site I'd forgotten even existed.  (Hello, Code Golf!) Ideally, I will find a question that isn't just entertaining to read, but also sparks my interest in writing something. There are some brilliant, eloquent, and thoughtful people on our sites, so I think some cross-pollination can strengthen the whole network.

The other day, I was looking into the RPG site and trying to figure out how it got a healthy bump in visitors since the beginning of the year. As I dug, it became clear that one factor has been direct traffic from other sites on the network. Digging a bit more, I turned up a series of ""hot questions"" such as Is 3d6 the same as 1d18? Since you don't have to be an expert in a particular RPG system to read, appreciate, or even answer this question, it attracted considerable attention (11,377 views so far). Site traffic also spiked noticeably the week the question was asked.

It was not without pain: two answers were deleted and the voting seems disproportionate. Arguably the question is not even on topic, yet it's tied for 26th on the all-time best questions list. While the answers tend to be good, none of them demonstrate any particular RPG expertise. But the question also got two solid first answers (one from Eric Lippert and the other from someone who has provided an equally upvoted answer). All-in-all, the HQ list looks like a net positive on that site. 

Speaking of rolling the dice, hot questions are a sort of gamble. They take advantage of the blockbuster business model. Every day there are dozens of new hot questions. Some of them blow up and others fizzle. Most sites consider it a great success to convert just one reader in a hundred (or even a thousand) into an occasional contributor. The hot question formula improves the odds by taking into account indicators of interest and quality signalled by regular users of the site. In other words, if lots of people on a site read, answer, and vote on posts, we can feel pretty confident that showing the question around will attract similar people.

1481,1481,2329,How to use multiple VLOOKUP with duplicate data?,"I have huge excel file. Column A has invoices(duplicate rows since each item in the invoice is a row), column B has SKU value of item bought(like 200ml, 300ml etc), column C has the brand bought(like Coca-Cola,Sprite etc) and column D has the no of items bought(like 10,15 etc).



The first table has is the dump file for all invoices and the intems bought

Now i want to find the No. of items bought given the condition that the brand is Coca-Cola, the SKU is 200ml and the invoice no. is XAX1X2X3 and display it in another cell.



Now in the second table, i want to match the invoice with the pack size and brand from first table and put the quantity in the empty cell

So the row that is highlighted in table 2 will show the value 3 cause invoice T1411031400114, pack size 200, brand coca-cola has Qty as 3.

I was thinking of using nested VLOOKUP but cant get the correct formula for it.

Any help will be appreciated.

1285,1285,2028,Reliable way of detecting whether an Android app is running in 'BlueStacks',"I would like to ascertain at run-time inside an Android app whether it is running within the BlueStacks Android emulator. This is so I can modify the way the app runs when running inside BlueStacks.

BlueStacks does not support multi-touch so I want to implement an alternative to the standard pinch-to-zoom functionality my current app has.

E.g.

If (appIsRunningInBlueStacks){
    mySurfaceView.enableMultiTouchAlternatives();
} else{
    mySurfaceView.enableMultiTouchFeatures();
}


What is a reliable way of ascertaining the value of appIsRunningInBlueStacks?

EDIT Summary of answers to comments on question:

Ben, Taras, thanks for the suggestions. The Build.MODEL etc. values for BlueStacks are:


Model: ""GT-I9100""
Manufacturer: ""samsung""
Device: ""GT-I9100""
Product: ""GT-I9100""


This is the same model number as the Samsung Galaxy SII so it would not be ideal to use this for fear of treating all users with SIIs the same as those on BlueStacks.

CommonsWare, the app continues to run in BlueStacks even with the &lt; uses-feature> for multitouch in the manifest. In fact (also answering iagreen's question)...

packageManager.hasSystemFeature(PackageManager.FEATURE_TOUCHSCREEN_MULTITOUCH_DISTINCT);


... returns true! This is to be expected I suppose as the emulator is convinced it is a Samsung Galaxy SII!

Therefore we are still without a way of reliably detecting whether an app is running on BlueStacks without also throwing all Samsung Galaxy SII users in the same bucket. Any other ideas?

649,649,1030,Regular Expression to Match String Exactly?,"I'll preface this question by mentioning that while I'm far from a regular expressions guru, they are not completely foreign to me. Building a regular expression to search for a pattern inside a particular string generally isn't a problem for me, but I have a (maybe?) unique situation.

In the above examples, the first and third values should be matched.

I'm using the regular expressions:

[0-9]{6}

Unfortunately, since all the above examples contain the specified pattern, all values are matched. This is not my intention.

So my question, in a nutshell, is how to write a regular expression that matches a string exactly and completely, with no additional characters to the right or left of the matched pattern? Is there a term for this type of matching? (Google was no help.) TIA

1935,1935,3086,Timing inside a shift register,"How I imagine synchronous digital networks work: data lines are sampled at rising clock edge, a set of transients occur, system settles, and data lines are sampled again on next rising edge. I would place transients at falling clock edges, that way both Tsu and Th time for sampling are clear. (Somewhat similar to SPI bus behavior.)

What see in a datasheet of a real world device (74595): D flipflops connected in series having a common clock. At the output of the first flipflop, transient on the data line follows rising clock edge with Tpd. The next flipflop needs Th time stable data line after rising edge to operate correctly. Of course it works because Tpd>Th, but it's only a matter of nanoseconds.

My problem with all this is that it's not robust (maybe not the best word). Visualizing stuff on a logic analyzer will be less useful because data lines practically change in sync with clock rising edge. Random errors caused by Th>Tpd are not really visible and go undetected. If I connect another shift register in series from a different technology, which requires longer hold times, the circuit won't work, no matter how slow clock I chose.

You bring up two issues. Let's call the two synchronous circuits A and B, where A feeds into B, and both share the same clock


Circuit won't work if total Tpd(A) &lt; Th(B) where Tpd is the combinational delay of the clock. Is this true? Absolutely! You're the circuit designer and it's your final responsibility to make sure the circuit works. In reality, it's not usually a source of worry; even if you feed one register output right into another's input, the design margin of the chip's specs is high. For a NXP 74HC595, for example, typical propagation delay at 4.5V supply is 19ns, required hold time is 3nsec, and typical hold time is -2nsec -- no problem there. For a TI SN74LV595A at 5V, typical propagation delay is 4.5nsec, minimum propagation delay is 1nsec, required hold time is 2nsec. Could this be a problem if the propagation delay and hold times are at their worst case? Absolutely. Could it be a problem if you cascade a SN74LV595A into an NXP74HC595? Absolutely. In those cases you may need to add combinational elements (buffers) with enough delay to make sure the hold time is met.
""Visualizing stuff on a logic analyzer will be less useful because data lines practically change in sync with clock rising edge."" True. Take a tip from SPI buses, and set the logic analyzer so that it samples the data on the clock falling edge.

What is the Goal of Advertising Network Questions?

Before discussing how to calculate hotness, or how the list should be ordered, we need to come to an agreement on what the heck we are actually trying to achieve. Once we know what we are looking to accomplish, we can find the best way to do that.

Please do not limit yourself to the very narrowly scoped topic above. Think outside the box if you'd like.

This means that a reward that is given for good behaviour, but only sometime and to varying degrees, is more effective than a proportional reward.

So what has this got to do with hot questions?

Hot questions are (one can only hope) good questions with a good answer since the upvotes are a major part of what drives them - So the positive part is taken care of. 

However, it is rare to get one of your questions/answers on the ""Hot questions"" list, and I haven't been able to detect much of a pattern (except that the questions seem to be more easily understandable to a general audience and are high quality) - So the intermittent random portion is taken care of.

1460,1460,2297,How do I deal with a slow and undedicated colleague in the team?,"I have been working on a new project. The project works like this: The end user can access a webapp using a link and he can add multiple systems on his network and manage that particular systems details. My part involves the front end and the webserver, which is done in python. My python actually communicates with another project which is entirely done in c &amp; c++. The c/c++ project is the main app which does all the functionality. My python sends the user request to it and displays the response from it to the user. 

I am very familiar with my work and I will finish it soon. Since that's not much work in it. And I am a person who loves to work. I spends most of the time in office and only go home when I feel sleepy.

The c/c++ app is managed by another colleague who has 5+ year experience and can do things much faster than me, but he never does it. May be he doesn't like to do it. His app crashes often when my python communicate with it or returns wrong values. It's full of bugs. Since my app depends on it, I am having a hard time building it. Instead of fixing the bugs, he asks me to slow down my work. He asks me to tell manager that my work needs a lot of time. He is asking me to fool the manager and even forcing me to work slowly like him.

During project meeting, when manager asks him about the bugs he says that he fixed everything and it works fine. Since he is my colleague, I couldn't tell anything to the manager. I obviously need to have a good relationship with my colleagues more than my manager, since most of the time we will be with our colleagues, not with the manager.

I am not able to tell the manager anything regarding this, since if manager asks him why, then he may think I complained about him to the manager. And he keeps on lying in the meeting. And since he fixes the bug slowly, it even slows down my work. Now I thought of working on the front-end part of my app  and finishing it off so that in the mean time he can make his project stable. Now he is asking me to tell the manager that my front end part require a lot of work and I may need more and more time, simply so that he can drag the project down. And the sad thing is our actual manager has gone to the US, so we have a temporary manager and this guy doesn't know about the project much, so the c,c++ just fools him.

Can anyone suggest me how I deal with this?
I wanted to finish off the project soon. How can I make him work even by maintaining a good relationship with him?

Responses to comments:


  If he's really deliberately misleading the company, you should report him to management.


I am new to this company and the other guy has been there for many years. And I have just started knowing my colleagues. If I directly go and complaint him, I don't think so I can make good relationship with my other colleagues. Even he has the power to mislead them. I am not telling he is a bad guy, he can do the work, but he is not doing it.


  Doesn't your company have any kind of bug tracking system ? 


Here actual bug tracking system isn't there. The company tries to finish off the project as soon as possible and gives it to the QA. And then fixes the bugs reported by QA. 


  This is why companies should give employees stock / options or some sort of ownership. That way you can literally tell the guy ""You are costing me monetary growth... don't you want to make money also?"".


The company has the stock options they have given me a 2500 share, mostly he too would have got some more.


  Seniority does deserve some benefit of a doubt. You really need to speak to him first and try to understand the problem. He may be out of his depth, you may be able to help him, there could easily be variables you are unaware of.

The project works like this: The end user can access a webapp using a link and he can add multiple systems on his network and manage that particular systems details. My part involves the front end and the webserver, which is done in python. My python actually communicates with another project which is entirely done in c &amp; c++. The c/c++ project is the main app which does all the functionality. My python sends the user request to it and displays the response from it to the user. 

I am very familiar with my work and I will finish it soon. Since that's not much work in it. And I am a person who loves to work. I spends most of the time in office and only go home when I feel sleepy.

The c/c++ app is managed by another colleague who has 5+ year experience and can do things much faster than me, but he never does it. May be he doesn't like to do it. His app crashes often when my python communicate with it or returns wrong values. It's full of bugs. Since my app depends on it, I am having a hard time building it. Instead of fixing the bugs, he asks me to slow down my work. He asks me to tell manager that my work needs a lot of time. He is asking me to fool the manager and even forcing me to work slowly like him.

During project meeting, when manager asks him about the bugs he says that he fixed everything and it works fine. Since he is my colleague, I couldn't tell anything to the manager. I obviously need to have a good relationship with my colleagues more than my manager, since most of the time we will be with our colleagues, not with the manager.

I am not able to tell the manager anything regarding this, since if manager asks him why, then he may think I complained about him to the manager. And he keeps on lying in the meeting. And since he fixes the bug slowly, it even slows down my work. Now I thought of working on the front-end part of my app  and finishing it off so that in the mean time he can make his project stable. Now he is asking me to tell the manager that my front end part require a lot of work and I may need more and more time, simply so that he can drag the project down. And the sad thing is our actual manager has gone to the US, so we have a temporary manager and this guy doesn't know about the project much, so the c,c++ just fools him.

Can anyone suggest me how I deal with this?
I wanted to finish off the project soon. How can I make him work even by maintaining a good relationship with him?

Responses to comments:


  If he's really deliberately misleading the company, you should report him to management.


I am new to this company and the other guy has been there for many years. And I have just started knowing my colleagues. If I directly go and complaint him, I don't think so I can make good relationship with my other colleagues. Even he has the power to mislead them. I am not telling he is a bad guy, he can do the work, but he is not doing it.


  Doesn't your company have any kind of bug tracking system ? 


Here actual bug tracking system isn't there. The company tries to finish off the project as soon as possible and gives it to the QA. And then fixes the bugs reported by QA. 


  This is why companies should give employees stock / options or some sort of ownership. That way you can literally tell the guy ""You are costing me monetary growth... don't you want to make money also?"".


The company has the stock options they have given me a 2500 share, mostly he too would have got some more.


  Seniority does deserve some benefit of a doubt. You really need to speak to him first and try to understand the problem. He may be out of his depth, you may be able to help him, there could easily be variables you are unaware of. It may be hard now, but you could easily make the situation a lot worse by jumping the gun.

4524,4524,7169,Would magic 'weapons' make the monk more balanced?,"The monk in D&amp;D 3.5 (and, to a lesser extent, in Pathfinder) is generally considered underpowered. 

Would adding magic 'weapons' that could add enhancement bonuses and magic weapon effects to a monk's unarmed strikes be sufficient to re-balance them? Would they then be over-balanced?

To be specific I'm thinking of something like hand wraps that are a zero-cost weapon having no mundane effect on combat (the wielder counts as unarmed) but  that can be enchanted in the same way and at the same cost as a normal magic weapon.

Update: 

Thanks to @mxyzplk, I see that Gauntlets would effectively fulfill this effect. Odd that I haven't seen this in any of the discussions on monk optimisation!

Regarding assessing balance, I'll judge this based on how well it addresses the issues in @KRyan's answer in the above-linked question. Obviously if anyone doesn't agree with his analysis then this question is moot, although I would like to see those competing opinions.
",Paul Hutton,https://rpg.stackexchange.com/users/2689,"Sure they help.

First of all, the monk isn't designed to be better at a single thing than other classes, so expecting its DPR to match a fighter's is a false expectation and in my opinion the monk being ""underpowered"" is a problem that exists only in highly optimized games, which is not the sum total of all the game types out there.  The linked question is about optimizing and making the monk ""brokenly good,"" which I can't speak to. However, in the various campaigns I've played in since 2000 with various groups in various cities under 3e, 3.5, and Pathfinder, monks have been popular classes at the table and have been considered a fun option not terribly overshadowed by others. 

However, it's certainly not the strongest class, and so Paizo's put out some gear and changes to help the monk get better! The amulet of mighty fists is the usual core item to magically buff the monk.  They just revised it and lowered its price, as well as gave the monk's ki strike some DR-overcoming power - see ""Monkeying Around"" on the Paizo blog.

The new body wrap of mighty strikes also directly augments unarmed strikes.  

There's been back and forth debate and conflicting rulings (to the point of conflicting verbiage in successive printings of the same weapon in different books) on whether weapons like cesti, gauntlets, rope gauntlets, emei piercers, and/or brass knuckles use a monk's unarmed damage or not. Many are monk weapons and thus by definition may be flurried, ki striked, etc. with, but the damage has been debated. I just say ""yes, use your unarmed damage"" to all of them.  In my pirate campaign the captain is a monk; he has magical gauntlets and also some cold iron brass knuckles he bought that have the knuckles inscribed with ""ELFPU"" and ""NCHER"".  By letting these weapons leverage unarmed damage, the monk avoids some of his traditional problems with DR and cheaper enhancement means less ""flurry of misses.""

The easy-going and free-spirited Michelangelo provides much of the comic relief. While he loves to read comics and eat pizza, this Turtle also has an adventurous side. 
Donatello (Bo Staff): Used to keep an opponent at range, but capable of dealing devastating damage in the hands of a master. The inventor, and technology geek, Donatello has a reputation as something of a smart aleck. He is perhaps the least violent Turtle, preferring to use his intellect to solve conflicts.

  Use Silicone sealant D 176 404 A2
  
  Removing
  Remove center, left and right sound insulation trays:
  
  Drain engine oil. 
  
  Remove securing bolts for oil pan. 
  
  Loosen oil pan with light blows of a rubber-headed hammer, if necessary. 
  
  Remove oil pan. 
  
  Remove sealant residue on cylinder block with a flat scraper. 
  
  Remove sealant residue on oil pan with a rotating brush, e.g. a drill motor with a plastic brush (wear eye protection). 
  
  Clean sealing surfaces. Surfaces must be free of oil and grease. 
  
  Installing
  Note: Observe the use-by date of the sealing compound. 
  
  The oil pan must be installed within 5 minutes of applying the silicone sealing compound. 
  
  Cut off tube nozzle at forward marking (approx. nozzle diameter: 3 mm). 
  
  Apply silicone sealing compound, as shown, to clean oil pan sealing surface. Sealant bead must be 2 to 3 mm thick 
  
  Run along inner side of bolt holes 
  
  The sealing compound bead must not be thicker, otherwise excess sealing compound will enter the oil pan and may block the oil suction pipe strainer. 
  
  Apply silicone sealant bead carefully as shown to areas marked by arrows. (Illustration shows position of sealant bead on cylinder block). 
  
  Install oil pan immediately and tighten all oil pan bolts lightly. 
  
  The oil pan must be flush with the cylinder block. 
  
  Tighten oil pan bolts to 15 Nm. 
  
  Tighten oil pan/transmission bolts to 45 Nm.

  Removing
  Remove center, left and right sound insulation trays:
  
  Drain engine oil. 
  
  Remove securing bolts for oil pan. 
  
  Loosen oil pan with light blows of a rubber-headed hammer, if necessary. 
  
  Remove oil pan. 
  
  Remove sealant residue on cylinder block with a flat scraper. 
  
  Remove sealant residue on oil pan with a rotating brush, e.g. a drill motor with a plastic brush (wear eye protection). 
  
  Clean sealing surfaces. Surfaces must be free of oil and grease. 
  
  Installing
  Note: Observe the use-by date of the sealing compound. 
  
  The oil pan must be installed within 5 minutes of applying the silicone sealing compound. 
  
  Cut off tube nozzle at forward marking (approx. nozzle diameter: 3 mm). 
  
  Apply silicone sealing compound, as shown, to clean oil pan sealing surface. Sealant bead must be 2 to 3 mm thick 
  
  Run along inner side of bolt holes 
  
  The sealing compound bead must not be thicker, otherwise excess sealing compound will enter the oil pan and may block the oil suction pipe strainer. 
  
  Apply silicone sealant bead carefully as shown to areas marked by arrows. (Illustration shows position of sealant bead on cylinder block). 
  
  Install oil pan immediately and tighten all oil pan bolts lightly. 
  
  The oil pan must be flush with the cylinder block. 
  
  Tighten oil pan bolts to 15 Nm. 
  
  Tighten oil pan/transmission bolts to 45 Nm. 
  
  Let the sealing compound dry for approx. 30 minutes after installing the oil pan. Only then fill the engine with oil.

913,913,1448,Is my interval training routine effective for mountain bike training?,"During these winter months I am currently attending the gym 3 times a week. On each of the days I start my training on an exercise bike with the following:


5 minute warm up
30 minutes, 1 minute hard, 1 minute recovery
5 minute warm down


I am using a specific interval training setting on the bike. I preset the training to level 15, which is a high resistance and as much as I can take.

Hard is a cadence of between 80-90rpm high resistance. Recovery is a cadence of 60prm and the resistance backs off considerably, I imagine to approximately level 7.

My heart rate towards the end of the session reaches 170–190bpm, and I am working flat-out. I turn 30 in March, am 5' 8"" and weigh approx 168lbs.

Does this training routine seem sensible for building strength and speed on the mountain? Should I be changing up the training with other types of bike training?

It is also worth noting that after the interval training I perform free weight strength training too.

UPDATE wp_posts SET guid = replace(guid, 'http://www.oldurl.com','http://www.newurl.com');
UPDATE wp_posts SET post_content = replace(post_content, 'http://www.oldurl.com', 'http://www.newurl.com');
UPDATE wp_postmeta SET meta_value = replace(meta_value,'http://www.oldurl.com','http://www.newurl.com');



Or simply define these in wp-config.php, these will overwrite domain URLs in database. I think this will be better for local development.

define( 'WP_HOME', 'http://example.com/blog' );
define( 'WP_SITEURL', 'http://example.com/blog' );



Done.

Make a dump of MYSQL database on server.

mysqldump -u username -p -h localhost dbname &gt; domain.sql

Create a archive of your WordPress website on server.

tar -czf domain.tar.gz domain.com

Download both on local machine. And extract the archive.

tar -xzf domain.tar.gz

Import database at local machine.

mysql -u username -p -h localhost dbname &lt; domain.sql

3503,3503,5587,Using logical operators on loops results in contradiction,"I'm dealing with a really, really weird issue in JavaScript. I'm working on a validator script that loops through a list of fields with jQuery. Each validation is tied to a regular expression on an object that goes like this:


var formats = {

      email: /[a-z0-9!#$%&'*+\/=?^_`{|}~-]+(?:\.[a-z0-9!#$%&'*+\/=?^_`{|}~-]+)*@(?:[a-z0-9](?:[a-z0-9-]*[a-z0-9])?\.)+[a-z0-9](?:[a-z0-9-]*[a-z0-9])?/g,

    };


Then I've created a function that given two parameters, the format and the test subject, returns true or false (merely a wrapper of the test method for the RegExp object):


validy.is = function(what, str) {
    return formats[what].test(str);
};


On a jQuery collection, I have INPUT elements with classes named accordingly to each format:


&lt;input type=""text"" class=""field email"" id=""field-1-1"" />
&lt;input type=""text"" class=""field phone"" id=""field-1-2"" />
...


Then, my validation function goes like this:


    formBuilder.validate = function() {

      var isValid = true;
      var allFields = $("".field"", formBuilder.form).toArray();

        console.info(""--> Field has classes: "" + $field.attr(""class""));

        for (var v = 0; v &lt; validable.length; v++) {

          var validableClass = validable[v];

The problem with it is that even when the field value is valid and isValid == true, when it does the isValid == isValid &amp;&amp; ... operation, isValid ends up being false.

How can it be possible for a true &amp;&amp; true expression to throw false.

I know there must be some stupidity I can't see, but I can't seem to find it. Can anyone lend a hand on this one?

Thanks!

Update 1

Originally, the line:

isValid = isValid &amp;&amp; (validy.is(validableClass, $field.val()) ? true : false);

was

isValid &amp;= validy.is(validableClass, $field.val();

Update 2

At some point, apparently the test method is returning 1 or 0 instead of true or false. But I can't pinpoint the exact moment when it happens.

Update 3

So it turns out that I was misusing the &amp;= operator as mentioned in the comments. But...

isValid = isValid &amp;&amp; validy.is(validableClass, $field.val());

...returns false when isValid == true and validy.is returns true independently.

Update 4

Changed the validy.is definition according to answer by CaffGeek:


    validy.is = function(what, str) {

      return !!formats[what].test(str);

    };


It had no effect, unfortunately.

I haven't tested this, but you don't need all the loops with jQuery.  It's set based.  You can simplify your code along this manner.

formBuilder.validate = function() {

    };

    var failedFields = $('EMPTYJQUERYSET');

    $.each(validable, function(index, className) {

                return ! validy.is(validableClass, $(this).val());
            });
        );
    });

    isValid = !!(failedFields.length == 0);

    console.info(""** Status of isValid: "" + isValid + "" **"");

    if (!isValid) {
        console.info(""--&gt; Invalid field detected"");
        //vw.popoverError($field, ""Error"", errors[validableClass]);

I'm a noob in using regex and here is my problem - I need to check a password if it contains 4 consecutive characters. so far what I have just covered is regarding the digits. Here is my regex:

ascending digits - ^.?(?:0123|1234|2345|3456|4567|5678|6789).$

descending digits - ^.?(?:9876|8765|7654|6543|5432|4321|3210).$

This works only for the digits. I know this is already an overkill in regex so I dont want to do it with the letters. It will be waaay too overkill if I do that.

abcdblah //true because of abcd

helobcde //true because of bcde

dcbablah //true beacause of dcba

heloedcb //true because of edcb

pg_dump relies on PostgreSQL's MVCC support to ask PostgreSQL to take a snapshot of the database state at a given point in time.

Changes made by concurrent transactions after the point where pg_dump gets its snapshot do not affect pg_dump, whether they're committed or not.

There are a few things that aren't necessarily consistent, like sequences, which continue to increase while pg_dump is running. But applications have to be prepared for gaps in sequences anyway, so this isn't considered to be a problem.

Cryptographic hash (like md5) with salt are bad.
It isn't uncommon to break/crack unix shadow files.
To make a password hash I should run it over md5 or whatever hundreds or thousands of times.


The article suggests that salted hashes are too easy to break and you'd want to select a password hash because its computationally longer to check passwords so you can not do as many per second.

I think doing 3 is bad for security and 1 is in reality the best option. What do you guys think?
",acidzombie24,https://security.stackexchange.com/users/5575,"
  Cryptographic hash (like md5) with salt are bad.


I didn't read the article, but this could be read in one of two ways:


MD5, even when salted is bad.
Salted hashes are bad.


In response to the first one, yes, this is true. MD5 has been proven insecure, and is too fast to be a secure hashing function anyways. Don't use MD5.

As for the second, it's completely wrong. Always salt your hash's. This helps prevent against rainbow table attacks.


  It isn't uncommon to break/crack unix shadow files.


This is true, most people choose insecure passwords that are quite easy to break. End of story. The classic security tool for doing this is John the Ripper. Even shadow files that use modern hashes often use algorithms that are too fast to really provide much protection (see below).


  To make a password hash I should run it over md5 or whatever hundreds or thousands of times.


This used to be true. The reason for doing this is to make it much slower per password attempt (since you have to run the hashing algorithm a lot). Even with a modern hash like SHA2, it's still often so fast that brute forcing a poorly chosen password can take a matter of days, or even hours.

Modern digest algorithms take this into account, and are designed to be computationally, or memory intensive.

Cryptographic hash (like md5) with salt are bad.
It isn't uncommon to break/crack unix shadow files.
To make a password hash I should run it over md5 or whatever hundreds or thousands of times.


The article suggests that salted hashes are too easy to break and you'd want to select a password hash because its computationally longer to check passwords so you can not do as many per second.

I think doing 3 is bad for security and 1 is in reality the best option. What do you guys think?
","
  Cryptographic hash (like md5) with salt are bad.


I didn't read the article, but this could be read in one of two ways:


MD5, even when salted is bad.
Salted hashes are bad.


In response to the first one, yes, this is true. MD5 has been proven insecure, and is too fast to be a secure hashing function anyways. Don't use MD5.

As for the second, it's completely wrong. Always salt your hash's. This helps prevent against rainbow table attacks.


  It isn't uncommon to break/crack unix shadow files.


This is true, most people choose insecure passwords that are quite easy to break. End of story. The classic security tool for doing this is John the Ripper. Even shadow files that use modern hashes often use algorithms that are too fast to really provide much protection (see below).


  To make a password hash I should run it over md5 or whatever hundreds or thousands of times.


This used to be true. The reason for doing this is to make it much slower per password attempt (since you have to run the hashing algorithm a lot). Even with a modern hash like SHA2, it's still often so fast that brute forcing a poorly chosen password can take a matter of days, or even hours.

Modern digest algorithms take this into account, and are designed to be computationally, or memory intensive. Common examples include bcrypt which includes a salt and is designed to be computationally expensive. A newer algorithm, scrypt, has been getting a bit of attention recently for also being memory intensive (making GPU cracking that much more difficult).

Someone mentioned that he guessed the correct number five times in a row, and said that this was surprising because the probability of this happening was $$\left(\frac{1}{38}\right)^5$$

This is true if you only play the game $5$ times. However, if you play it more than $5$ times there's a higher (should be much higher?) probability that you'll get $5$ in a row at some point. 

I was thinking about how surprised this person should be at their streak of $m$ correct guesses given that they play $n$ games, each with probability $p$ of success. It makes intuitive sense that their surprise should be proportional to $1/q$ (or maybe $\log(1/q)$ since $1$ in a billion doesn't surprise you $10$ times more than $1$ in $100$ million), where $q$ is the probability that they get at least one streak of $m$ correct guesses at some point in their $n$ games. 

So, with the Roulette example I was thinking about, $p=1/38$ and $m=5$. 

I tried to find an explicit formula for $q$ in terms of $n$, and encountered some difficulty, because of the non-independence of ""getting a streak in the first five tries"" and ""getting a streak in tries $2$ through $6$"" (if the first is a failure, it's much more  likely that the second will be too). 



In summary, two questions:


How do I find the probability that you get $5$ correct guesses in a row at some point if you play $n$ games of Roulette?
More generally, what is the probability that you get $m$ successes at some point in a series of $n$ events, each with probability $p$ of success? 


The variables satisfy $\,\,\,m,n \in \mathbb{N}$, $\,\,\,m\leq n$, $\,\,\,p \in \mathbb{R}$, $\,\,\,0 \leq p \leq 1$.



If we write the answer to the second question as a function $q(m,n,p)$, then we can say that $q$ should be increasing with $n$, decreasing with $m$, and increasing with $p$. It should equal $p^n$ when $m=n$ and should equal $1$ when $p=1$ and $0$ when $p=0$. 

I feel as though this should be a basic probability problem, but I'm having trouble solving it. Maybe some kind of recursive approach would work? Given $q(n,m,p)$, I think I could write $q(n+1,m,p)$ using the probability that the last $m-1$ results are all successes ...

Thoughts: because a vehicle's battery has a significantly different voltage across it when the engine is off or on, (12v vs 14.5v) perhaps there is a controlling PWM circuit that keeps brightness constant over a range of voltages.

",Jodes,https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/4436,"Contrary to initial intuition, it's actually to increase the brightness.

LEDs can be driven at a constant current, or they can be driven with a pulsed current.

With constant current you have to limit the current to a relatively low value - for instance many common small LEDs are limited to a constant current of say 20mA.  That gives good brightness for indication purposes, but it's not that great.

LEDs, when driven with pulsed current, can be driven with a considerably higher current - maybe 5 to 10 times as much, or even more.  That could be say 100mA for what would normally be a 20mA LED.  However, there are restrictions on what the pulses can be - typically with limits on the frequency and duty cycle - maybe as little as 1% duty.

The end result is that the higher current increases the perceived brightness of the LEDs, since more photons are being emitted when they are on, but at the cost of some flicker, which is only really noticed when the LEDs are in motion.

So you get more perceived brightness from smaller and cheaper LEDs without using more current (often less current) on average than if they were on constant.

Posted by Amanda-333 on April 12, 2011 at 5:58am

It works fine if I only have events that have their start- and endtime on the same day.

2011-04-13 12:00 – 2011-04-13 14:00 Event 8

The problem: I have some events that take several days or weeks.
Example: I create one event with the start date of 2011-04-12 10:00 and the end date of 2011-04-15 19:00 for example.

It's exactly what I need on my view, but it hasn't been answered yet.

Posted by Amanda-333 on April 12, 2011 at 5:58am
I wanted to ask how I can group events by day in a view.

It works fine if I only have events that have their start- and endtime on the same day.
2011-04-12
2011-04-12 10:00 – 2011-04-12 18:00 Event 1
2011-04-12 12:00 – 2011-04-12 14:00 Event 2

2011-04-13
2011-04-13 10:00 – 2011-04-13 18:00 Event 5
2011-04-13 12:00 – 2011-04-13 14:00 Event 8

The problem: I have some events that take several days or weeks.
Example: I create one event with the start date of 2011-04-12 10:00 and the end date of 2011-04-15 19:00 for example.

This event now shows up in the grouped view as
2011-04-12 - 2011-04-18
2011-04-12 10:00 - 2011-04-15 19:00 Event 11

I would like to have that event sorted into the regular day groups (split that event into day parts):
2011-04-12
2011-04-12 10:00 - 2011-04-15 19:00 Event 11

2011-04-13

Hydrophobia as a rare presentation of Cotard's syndrome: a case report.1

Cotard's syndrome itself is a bizarre psychiatric condition that the authors of the above paper define well:


  Cotard’s syndrome is a rare condition where the central symptom is a nihilistic delusion, which, in its complete form, leads the patient to deny his own existence and that of the external world.


The patient described in this case report harbored delusions that his internal organs were shrinking. He asserted that his abdomen would rupture if he internalized anything. The hydrophobia was secondary to this concern. When given a glass of water he showed a panic reaction and attempted to keep away. Orientation and memory remained intact. 

The authors go to length to point out that this was not, in fact, a case of rabies (as thought that were in question at this point!). Also, the patient himself was not aware of symptoms of rabies, ruling out ""rabies hysteria"" (a hypochondriacal delusion that one has rabies).

  Why does rabies cause hydrophobia? 
  
  Agony, Hydrophobia and viruses in the light of evolutionary principles


Has hydrophobia been found outside of rabies?

I have only seen it being mentioned as a symptom of rabies.
","You are correct that hydrophobia is often considered pathognomonic of rabies. However, I offer for your consideration: 

Hydrophobia as a rare presentation of Cotard's syndrome: a case report.1

Cotard's syndrome itself is a bizarre psychiatric condition that the authors of the above paper define well:


  Cotard’s syndrome is a rare condition where the central symptom is a nihilistic delusion, which, in its complete form, leads the patient to deny his own existence and that of the external world.


The patient described in this case report harbored delusions that his internal organs were shrinking. He asserted that his abdomen would rupture if he internalized anything. The hydrophobia was secondary to this concern. When given a glass of water he showed a panic reaction and attempted to keep away. Orientation and memory remained intact. 

The authors go to length to point out that this was not, in fact, a case of rabies (as thought that were in question at this point!). Also, the patient himself was not aware of symptoms of rabies, ruling out ""rabies hysteria"" (a hypochondriacal delusion that one has rabies).

Hydrophobia, then, is a rare manifestation of a rare psychiatric disease in addition to the more frequent and well-known association with rabies.

The fonts are installed, but seem in some way ""overlapped"" by windows.

If I open the Windows fonts dir I can see only one style. If I delete it, then a different style appear and so on.

Anyone has a solution for this problem?

Thanks.
",Alex,https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/users/2030,"The source of this problem is malformed font files. The internal names of the fonts are in conflict and the flags that indicate connections between the different font files in a typeface family (Regular, Bold, Italic, Bold Italic, etc.) are missing. 

The terminology is awkward. Technically and historically ""Foo"" is a typeface and ""18 pt Foo Bold Condensed"" is a font, but in the era of personal computers the definitions have blurred: a typeface is now often referred to as a ""font"" (even though you'll buy a particular style of that typeface as a ""font"" in any online store), particularly among non-typographers. The variations tend to be called ""styles."" People coming newly (last 25 years or so) into design are so used to scaling a font in software that they forget every size of every style of a typeface was once drawn and made individually.

For a regular application (non-professional) to give you the usual ""Regular, Bold, Italic, Bold Italic"" choices, the font files themselves must be individually named internally and the fact that they are associated is a specific internal flag. It's these internal flags that allow you to create bold or italic text with a keyboard shortcut or style dropdown -- the Foo Bold font file tells the OS ""I am the Bold version of Foo,"" and so on.

You have a situation where all the individual font files have the same internal name, so Windows can't differentiate them. You see exactly one font (style) in a family; delete it, and you see another one, and so on. In Word, Open Office, etc., that's probably all you'll see. (Arial Narrow famously suffered from this problem because of an error in creating the files -- it just wouldn't show up at all, or would never show up as an available style for Arial.) 

Most non-graphics applications natively understand only the usual four fonts in a family. Additional members (narrow, thin, black, extended, etc.) show up as separate typefaces.

More sophisticated applications such as Photoshop or InDesign know how to read the association flags in a set of font files and can display all the variations in a single dropdown. Garamond Premier Pro, as an example, has 39 font files in four optical sizes -- caption, regular, subhead and display -- that all show up in a single dropdown if and only if the files themselves contain the correct internal information. The ones you are having trouble with do not.

The most common source of the problem you are seeing is conversion utilities that don't do a proper job of taking older or other-platform files and turning them into well-formed OpenType or TrueType files. This often affects (illegal, it must be said) Mac --> Windows conversions, because on Mac OS the font information is split between a visible file and a hidden one.

Fonts are installed, but appear to ""overlap"" with windows to some extent.","The source of this problem is malformed font files. The internal names of the fonts are in conflict and the flags that indicate connections between the different font files in a typeface family (Regular, Bold, Italic, Bold Italic, etc.) are missing. 

The terminology is awkward. Technically and historically ""Foo"" is a typeface and ""18 pt Foo Bold Condensed"" is a font, but in the era of personal computers the definitions have blurred: a typeface is now often referred to as a ""font"" (even though you'll buy a particular style of that typeface as a ""font"" in any online store), particularly among non-typographers. The variations tend to be called ""styles."" People coming newly (last 25 years or so) into design are so used to scaling a font in software that they forget every size of every style of a typeface was once drawn and made individually.

For a regular application (non-professional) to give you the usual ""Regular, Bold, Italic, Bold Italic"" choices, the font files themselves must be individually named internally and the fact that they are associated is a specific internal flag. It's these internal flags that allow you to create bold or italic text with a keyboard shortcut or style dropdown -- the Foo Bold font file tells the OS ""I am the Bold version of Foo,"" and so on.

You have a situation where all the individual font files have the same internal name, so Windows can't differentiate them. You see exactly one font (style) in a family; delete it, and you see another one, and so on. In Word, Open Office, etc., that's probably all you'll see. (Arial Narrow famously suffered from this problem because of an error in creating the files -- it just wouldn't show up at all, or would never show up as an available style for Arial.) 

Most non-graphics applications natively understand only the usual four fonts in a family. Additional members (narrow, thin, black, extended, etc.) show up as separate typefaces.

More sophisticated applications such as Photoshop or InDesign know how to read the association flags in a set of font files and can display all the variations in a single dropdown. Garamond Premier Pro, as an example, has 39 font files in four optical sizes -- caption, regular, subhead and display -- that all show up in a single dropdown if and only if the files themselves contain the correct internal information. The ones you are having trouble with do not.

The most common source of the problem you are seeing is conversion utilities that don't do a proper job of taking older or other-platform files and turning them into well-formed OpenType or TrueType files. This often affects (illegal, it must be said) Mac --> Windows conversions, because on Mac OS the font information is split between a visible file and a hidden one. If the conversion utility doesn't correctly parse the hidden file, you get a malformed OpenType or TrueType font file that won't work properly on either platform.

Very old and ""freebie"" font files that are incorrectly set up internally can cause the same issue.

Historically, there is a ""hdf5"" package available but it has some odd dependencies, is a bit clunky and not available for the current version of R. You would have to back version R and then download a supported version of the package.

3474,3474,5539,KL divergence between two univariate Gaussians,"I need to determine the KL-divergence between two Gaussians. I am comparing my results to these, but I can't reproduce their result. My result is obviously wrong, because the KL is not 0 for KL(p, p).

I wonder where I am doing a mistake and ask if anyone can spot it.

Let $p(x) = N(\mu_1, \sigma_1)$ and $q(x) = N(\mu_2, \sigma_2)$. From Bishop's
PRML I know that

$$KL(p, q) = - \int p(x) \log q(x) dx + \int p(x) \log p(x) dx$$

where integration is done over all real line, and that

$$\int p(x) \log p(x) dx = \frac{1}{2} (1 + \log 2 \pi \sigma_1^2),$$

so I restrict myself to $\int p(x) \log q(x) dx$, which I can write out as

$$-\int p(x) \log \frac{1}{(2 \pi \sigma_2^2)^{(1/2)}} e^{-\frac{(x-\mu_2)^2}{2 \sigma_2^2}} dx,$$

which I can separate into

$$\frac{1}{2} \log (2 \pi \sigma_2^2) - \int p(x) \log e^{-\frac{(x-\mu_2)^2}{2 \sigma_2^2}} dx.$$

Taking the log I get

$$\frac{1}{2} \log (2 \pi \sigma_2^2) - \int p(x) -\frac{(x-\mu_2)^2}{2 \sigma_2^2} dx,$$

where I separate the sums and get $\sigma_2^2$ out of the integral.

$$\frac{1}{2} \log (2 \pi \sigma_2^2) + \frac{\int p(x) x^2 dx - \int p(x) 2x\mu dx + \int p(x) \mu^2 dx}{2 \sigma_2^2}$$

Letting $\langle \rangle$ denote the expectation operator under $p$, I can rewrite this as

$$\frac{1}{2} \log (2 \pi \sigma_2^2) + \frac{\langle x^2 \rangle - 2 \langle x \rangle \mu_2 + \mu_2^2}{2 \sigma_2^2}.$$

We know that $var(x) = \langle x^2 \rangle - \langle x \rangle ^2$. Thus 

$$\langle x^2 \rangle = \sigma_1^2 + \mu_1^2$$

and therefore

$$\frac{1}{2} \log (2 \pi \sigma^2) + \frac{\sigma_1^2 + \mu_1^2 - 2 \mu_1 \mu_2 + \mu_2^2}{2 \sigma_2^2},$$

which I can put as

$$\frac{1}{2} \log (2 \pi \sigma_2^2) + \frac{\sigma_1^2 + (\mu_1 - \mu_2)^2}{2 \sigma_2^2}.$$

Putting everything together, I get to 

\begin{align*}
KL(p, q) &amp;= - \int p(x) \log q(x) dx + \int p(x) \log p(x) dx\\
&amp;= \frac{1}{2} \log (2 \pi \sigma_2^2) + \frac{\sigma_1^2 + (\mu_1 - \mu_2)^2}{2 \sigma_2^2} - \frac{1}{2} (1 + \log 2 \pi \sigma_1^2)\\

The tone should be the similar to the tone you would strike toward a relatively new co-worker who stopped by your desk with a similar question.

In my mind, this is the wrong question.  For many ""bad comments,"" it would most likely be better to not comment at all, and simply use the voting and moderation tools.

Ultimately, the answer isn't some sort of awk or perl script that will turn a rude comment into a constructive comment, but to change our attitudes from dealing with questions as efficiently as possible to dealing with human beings with questions.

The only thing more frustrating than a rude comment is a ""polite"" comment given through gritted teeth, or belied by every other aspect of the person's behavior.  A 30 minute hold time is not soothed by the recorded reminder that ""your call is very important to us"" every 20 seconds.

The challenge isn't about how to fake civility, it's to actually be civil.  To consider the questioner or answerer to be an actual human person with an actual problem rather than one more thing we have to deal with today.

This one is rough. You can't punish someone due to plagiarism before they submit work. The best policy, in my opinion, is twofold. 

First - if a student brings plagiarized work then you should simply say ""I'm sorry, I cannot help you with work that is not your own."" and point to you university's policy regarding academic dishonesty. Repeat offenders should be put on notice.

Second - If you grade the final assignments or are involved consider spending a bit more time plagiarize-checking these particular student's submissions. These students have shown that they were willing to claim other's work as their own, being a bit more stringent in checking their work for originality is, in my opinion, completely fair.


Students will bring in papers again and again, with little changes
put in at each stage, hoping their minimal effort each time will be

This sounds like a communication problem. After meeting with a student there should be no confusion about what will improve the student's work. For something like a paper it should be ""In order to improve this paper you should: extend the intro, go into more detail here, etc"" Students returning for additional assistance should have some sort of checklist that they should complete prior to returning for more assistance. Make this clear and obvious and, if there are multiple tutors a student could work with, something that is kept in some sort of notes system.

as a sort of test if I will notice. It seems difficult to punish
plagiarism when the paper is not yet submitted.


This one is rough. You can't punish someone due to plagiarism before they submit work. The best policy, in my opinion, is twofold. 

First - if a student brings plagiarized work then you should simply say ""I'm sorry, I cannot help you with work that is not your own."" and point to you university's policy regarding academic dishonesty. Repeat offenders should be put on notice.

Second - If you grade the final assignments or are involved consider spending a bit more time plagiarize-checking these particular student's submissions. These students have shown that they were willing to claim other's work as their own, being a bit more stringent in checking their work for originality is, in my opinion, completely fair.


Students will bring in papers again and again, with little changes
put in at each stage, hoping their minimal effort each time will be
sufficient to reach their goal of a ""D"".


This sounds like a communication problem. After meeting with a student there should be no confusion about what will improve the student's work. For something like a paper it should be ""In order to improve this paper you should: extend the intro, go into more detail here, etc"" Students returning for additional assistance should have some sort of checklist that they should complete prior to returning for more assistance. Make this clear and obvious and, if there are multiple tutors a student could work with, something that is kept in some sort of notes system.

If so, is travelling by bus the only way? I've heard there's also a train that leaves from Santa Cruz to Brazil, via Corumba? Is this currently running? Does anyone have experience travelling to Brazil like this?
",unknownprotocol,https://travel.stackexchange.com/users/9504,"There are buses from Santa Cruz to San Matias in Eastern Bolivia, on the border to Brazil. It takes around 15-18 hours on dirt roads. Once in Mato Grosso (on your way to Cáceres) the roads are very good and modern.
You won't easily find information on buses online, just go to the bus terminal once you're there in Santa Cruz and buy your ticket. Don't plan too tight as there are often very few buses per day between destinations in Bolivia, sometimes not even every day. It might also be at 6 am or similarly unlikely times.
Get your passport stamped in San Matias (exit stamp Bolivia) and in Cáceres (entry stamp Brazil), even though it's 100 km from the border. Note that the border office in San Matias isn't always open.

You are not allowed to bring certain plant and animal products into Brazil, so try to finish your food before crossing the border. I wasn't checked, but it could happen and I suppose it's better to avoid trouble.
You have to take a taxi from San Matias to the border which should be no more than 7 Reals (if shared) or 15 Reals (single) (prices as of November 2014). Of course you could also pay in Bolivianos if you still have some. But you will need Reals to pay the bus from the border to Cáceres, a single ticket is 19 Reals, so exchange some money while in San Matias. There is an exchange office in town. You can also take a shared taxi, which should be 25 Reals and is much faster and more convenient as it can bring you directly to your destination in Cáceres, rather than the bus terminal. In my case, it brought me to the federal police for immigration first, waited for me, then we went to the bus terminal for onward travel at no additional cost.

3644,3644,5815,Is it common to have a pressure shut off for Jet Water Pumps?,"I'm looking at installing a pump for a domestic water supply with a pressure tank.  I'd like to be able to determine if a pump will shut off once it has reached pressure.

I've seen several pumps installed which seem to shut off automatically but I can't seem to figure out if this is a standard feature or not because it doesn't seem to appear in their specifications.  For example, this grundfos pump is commonly used and I've seen other grundfos's shut off automatically at pressure.  Is this standard for a jet water pump?

Thanks.



EDIT:

After some time the manufacturer indicated that there is a port on the side for the pressure switch and sent a photo of one installed.  So now I know that's probably the standard way most jet pumps come so they can be externally configured to different PSI settings.

1881,1881,2988,Amplifier damage caused by failed power supply capacitors,"MY QUESTION IS THIS:
Would failed power supply caps cause peripheral damage to the amp, preamp or control circuits ? Supposedly there is ""protection"" for ""DC offset, over current and over heat""

I have a Proton AM-656 amplifier with ""Dynamic Power on Demand"" which is a second higher voltage supply rail (switched to when needed) that creates 6db of headroom and 2 ohm stable. I did not think there was fault protection, turns out the schematic block diagram states there is.

One day with the amp power on I tightened/snugged up the speaker binding post. There was a single frayed speaker wire (unnoticed) that shorted. The amp proceed to billow smoke. I looked inside to find several power supply caps having oozed their electrolyte onto the circuit board. 

I am shopping to recap two of my other amps and was thinking of recapping the Proton, however I do not want to waste my time if there is likely to be damage to the circuits other than electrolytic capacitors.
",erick77,https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/50159,"A more likely scenario is that the short circuit damaged the power transistors so they failed short circuit, and they in turn caused the capacitors to fail. If the amp uses discrete power transistors, these will be replaceable. If it's a custom IC or hybrid module, you're less likely to be able to find replacements.

Resistance measurements on the transistor pins (compare with the ""good"" channel) looking for collector-emitter shorts may help confirm this scenario, and show which transistors need replacing. Or if both channels measure the same, you may be lucky and re-capping will be OK.

1712,1712,2711,Is it possible to Cap a GridFS collection?,"I'm trying to store my application results in a mongo database.  There are some issues to this, first we generate a lot of data because it is raw image files, up to 50MB per record and 5 records per second at full speed, that's worst case though not typical. This isn't a problem using gridFS. In the mongod.cfg we are using directoryPerDB: true and I create a symlink for the Results database folder to a dedicated SSD where all the results database is kept.  All the settings data is kept in a couple different databases on the OS drive, and the results data has a dedicated drive. This is all working great for our application.

My problem is filling up the results disk. I need to basically have a capped collection to a max size, and then delete only the oldest files.  But I don't see a way to do this with gridFS? Is there a setting  or something I'm missing that would allow capping this?  

I found this answer GridFS disk management but that seems to apply to mongod, and i don't think you can set a quota per database as the Results database is the only one I need to be limited.  

At this point I guess i will write a task that cleans the oldest files out periodically if the total is over a threshold limit, i'm just afraid this is not going to be very efficient.  Are there any recommendations on the best way to handle this?  
",trashrobber,https://stackoverflow.com/users/480819,"To make a long story short: you can not cap GridFS in a useful way. Here is why:

When you store a file in GridFS, it is split into chunks of 255kB, by default in a collection named fs.chunks, which absolutely can be capped by doing

db.createCollection(""fs.chunks"",{capped:true, size:52428800})


The capping would apply to those chunks, which are individual documents. So when you add a file which would make the fs.chunks to exceed its cap, only chunks of the oldest files would be removed. Another problem would be that the files metadata, which is stored in fs.files by default, would not be updated, leaving stale entries in fs.files for which no entries in fs.chunks are present any more, or – worse – only a fraction of the chunks are still present.

There are ways to overcome this (checking if the size in bytes of the chunks combined equals the length field of the fs.files document of the respective file, for example), but they are at least as complicated (and much slower!) as doing a check pre-insert wether the collection would exceed the threshold using the collections stats and delete as many of the oldest files as needed to fit the new file in without exceeding the threshold. 

The latter, by the way, is my suggestion on how to solve your problem.

Another solution would be to use a dedicated instance with the limitations applied in my answer to the question you mentioned.

5645,5645,8949,Is my interval training routine effective for mountain bike training?,"During these winter months I am currently attending the gym 3 times a week. On each of the days I start my training on an exercise bike with the following:


5 minute warm up
30 minutes, 1 minute hard, 1 minute recovery
5 minute warm down


I am using a specific interval training setting on the bike. I preset the training to level 15, which is a high resistance and as much as I can take.

Hard is a cadence of between 80-90rpm high resistance. Recovery is a cadence of 60prm and the resistance backs off considerably, I imagine to approximately level 7.

My heart rate towards the end of the session reaches 170–190bpm, and I am working flat-out. I turn 30 in March, am 5' 8"" and weigh approx 168lbs.

Does this training routine seem sensible for building strength and speed on the mountain? Should I be changing up the training with other types of bike training?

It is also worth noting that after the interval training I perform free weight strength training too.
",DigiKev,https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/users/3323,"Whether an interval training is effective or not depends mostly on your particulars relative to the interval. Heart rate is only a very inexact measure of effort, but you seem to be roughly in the ballpark.

A better gauge of interval quality would be this: how long can you keep up the effort? A more typical interval training might be e.g. 6-7 times 3-8 minute efforts, with 2-5 minute rests, at such intensity that you simply cannot complete another interval round.

A goal of ""strength and speed"" on the mountain is unspecific enough that you can be sure it's being helped somewhat, and in some way, by the intervals.

4488,4488,7117,How do I deal with a slow and undedicated colleague in the team?,"I have been working on a new project. The project works like this: The end user can access a webapp using a link and he can add multiple systems on his network and manage that particular systems details. My part involves the front end and the webserver, which is done in python. My python actually communicates with another project which is entirely done in c &amp; c++. The c/c++ project is the main app which does all the functionality. My python sends the user request to it and displays the response from it to the user. 

I am very familiar with my work and I will finish it soon. Since that's not much work in it. And I am a person who loves to work. I spends most of the time in office and only go home when I feel sleepy.

The c/c++ app is managed by another colleague who has 5+ year experience and can do things much faster than me, but he never does it. May be he doesn't like to do it. His app crashes often when my python communicate with it or returns wrong values. It's full of bugs. Since my app depends on it, I am having a hard time building it. Instead of fixing the bugs, he asks me to slow down my work. He asks me to tell manager that my work needs a lot of time. He is asking me to fool the manager and even forcing me to work slowly like him.

During project meeting, when manager asks him about the bugs he says that he fixed everything and it works fine. Since he is my colleague, I couldn't tell anything to the manager. I obviously need to have a good relationship with my colleagues more than my manager, since most of the time we will be with our colleagues, not with the manager.

I am not able to tell the manager anything regarding this, since if manager asks him why, then he may think I complained about him to the manager. And he keeps on lying in the meeting. And since he fixes the bug slowly, it even slows down my work. Now I thought of working on the front-end part of my app  and finishing it off so that in the mean time he can make his project stable. Now he is asking me to tell the manager that my front end part require a lot of work and I may need more and more time, simply so that he can drag the project down. And the sad thing is our actual manager has gone to the US, so we have a temporary manager and this guy doesn't know about the project much, so the c,c++ just fools him.

Can anyone suggest me how I deal with this?
I wanted to finish off the project soon. How can I make him work even by maintaining a good relationship with him?

  If he's really deliberately misleading the company, you should report him to management.


I am new to this company and the other guy has been there for many years. And I have just started knowing my colleagues. If I directly go and complaint him, I don't think so I can make good relationship with my other colleagues. Even he has the power to mislead them. I am not telling he is a bad guy, he can do the work, but he is not doing it.


  Doesn't your company have any kind of bug tracking system ? 


Here actual bug tracking system isn't there. The company tries to finish off the project as soon as possible and gives it to the QA. And then fixes the bugs reported by QA. 


  This is why companies should give employees stock / options or some sort of ownership. That way you can literally tell the guy ""You are costing me monetary growth... don't you want to make money also?"".


The company has the stock options they have given me a 2500 share, mostly he too would have got some more.


  Seniority does deserve some benefit of a doubt. You really need to speak to him first and try to understand the problem. He may be out of his depth, you may be able to help him, there could easily be variables you are unaware of. It may be hard now, but you could easily make the situation a lot worse by jumping the gun. 


I even does it, first his app wasn't handling multiple requests at a time, he was using a queue to handle the requests I sent to him. I even suggested to him some of my ideas on it. He said he already had these ideas, and will be executing them. His explanations was: ""Everything require certain time to do and this is a project which may need two years to complete and we are asked to finish it in two months"". I used to have a hard time coding during first few weeks because of this bug. But now he fixed it. But he is using a single queue for a user requests and that is now slowing down the app, since it processes one request at a time.


  What is QA doing this whole time? Why aren't they reporting/confirming the status of the project(s)?

The names existed before orbital theory.  There is no need to investigate f-block elements to observe excitations to f-orbitals.  Electrons of any elment can be excited to an f-orbital. In fact, Bergmann discovered the series in the sodium spectrum.  What was orginially known as the sharp series, were transition to s-orbitals, the primary series transitions to p-orbitals, etc.

element, and the letter F which has been attached to it had its origin in this idea."" (page 94).

The names existed before orbital theory.  There is no need to investigate f-block elements to observe excitations to f-orbitals.  Electrons of any elment can be excited to an f-orbital. In fact, Bergmann discovered the series in the sodium spectrum.  What was orginially known as the sharp series, were transition to s-orbitals, the primary series transitions to p-orbitals, etc. 

See The Origin of the s, p, d, f Orbital Labels for additional information.

2184,2184,3477,Why can't a Sefer Torah be written in Aramaic?,"
  In the Mishna, Megillah 1:8, Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel is quoted as having said that Greek is the only language, other than Hebrew, in which it is permissible to write sifrei Torah. Commenting on this, the Jerusalem Talmud (Megillah 71c) says that the sages checked and discovered that Greek is the only language into which it is possible to translate the Torah with its exact meaning.


Source: an answer to Translation to Greek

But why not Aramaic? I remember reading somewhere that it had ""sparks"" of holiness, the proof being that it is the language of the Gemara. It's also linguistically more similar to Hebrew than Greek, so it should be possible to get a good translation.
",Scimonster,https://judaism.stackexchange.com/users/5151,"Your question appears to be asking why it would not be kosher to use an Aramaic Torah scroll in lieu of a Hebrew one.  You may want to reword your question.  Throughout Jewish history and up until the present, Aramaic targumim have been recited in the synagogue alongside the traditional Hebrew Torah.  Currently the Jews of Yemen read from Targum Onkelos during the Torah reading.  However, the practice of solely reading from a scroll written in a language other than Hebrew, such as Aramaic or Greek, was never common practice.  There are many reasons for this, a few of which are given below.


The Talmud [Sotah 33] discusses praying in Aramaic instead of Hebrew and states that the angels do not understand Aramaic.  The message here is that Hebrew is preferable over Aramaic since it allows the person reciting it to have a closer connection to heaven.
This notion is further reinforced by the practice שנים מקרא ואחד תרגום [Berakhot 8a].  This is referring to the practice of twice reading the weekly Torah portion in Hebrew with the congregation, while reading once from the Targum.

Twisting makes its probable that both wires are equally affected by the unwanted signal. This means that the receiver which calculate the difference between the two receives no unwanted signal.”

  In balanced pair operation, the two
  wires carry equal and opposite signals

  signals into the wires by coupling of

I search for a proof of the following fact:

If the set of intersection points of two analytic curves is infinite, then these curves coincide.

Can we prove the same as above if we relax the condition that the coordinates are analytic to the condition that the coordinates belong to the class $C^{\infty}$?

Edit: Thanks to below remark by Ramiro, to obtain the above implication, we have to assume that any two curves $K_{1}, K_{2}$ as in the question are such that $K_{1} \cap K_{2}$ is not another analytic curve.

2nd edit: As suggested Peter, we can reformulate our question as follows:

Apache 2.2 &lt; 2.2.16 Multiple Vulnerabilities


Our customers run scanners and they check Apache version related to the official Apache version numbering.

We use Centos, and the Apache version numbering is different from the official Apache version numbering.

For example now we install httpd-2.2.15-26.el6.centos.x86_64 and it includes all security patches released by Apache in recent versions.

The Centos Apache version numbering relies on the RedHat Apache version numbering and they do not change the base number (httpd-2.2.15) each update.
But scanners do not “understand” this and check that 2.2.15 &lt; 2.2.16.

Can you point me to the good document that explains the RedHat Apache version numbering?

Do you know if exist scanner that “understand” the RedHat Apache version numbering?
",Michael,https://security.stackexchange.com/users/24842,"What you're experiencing is a common problem.  Vulnerability scanners that rely upon service banners do not deal with vendors like Red Hat which backport security updates.  They are also prone to making assumptions about configuration that lead to false positives.

You may be able to improve the accuracy of the scan by running an credentialed scan.  If your scanner supports it, you can specify account credentials that it will use to log in and look at ""internal"" information.  For example, it can use 'rpm' to determine which actual Apache package is installed, and base its verdict upon that rather than the banner that the service prints to external scanners.  Such a scanner should have access to an up-to-date database that will tell it what the real issues are.

If your scanner won't do it, then the usual solution is to do it yourself.  You would need to look up whether you're running the newest version.  For example, @Rook points out that there are Apache vulnerabilities newer than the package you reference.  Looking at those vulnerabilities, you can pull the CVE ID and look it up in Red Hat's CVE Database. For example, their entry for CVE-2013-1862 points you to the errata RHSA-2013:0815 which says that httpd-2.2.15-28 contains fixes for that CVE.  It also points out that there's a newer RHBA release, so there's a newer package with bug (but not security) fixes.  Repeat that process for any other CVEs that you're concerned with and you can make an educated decision about whether you're patched despite what the banner says.  If the CentOS package is a direct correlation to the RHEL package, you should be fine - but the RHEL package was announced on 5/13, so I don't know how @Rook's cited 3/2 release date jibes with that.

More seriously, in the first case you'd have a query like

SELECT date,event from entries where date = $date


and now you'd have

SELECT date,event from entries where date between $date_minus_one_month and $date


Then store the results in an associative array, indexed by days.

He does a query for each day's cell.

NB: When using /dev/random you may have to wiggle your mouse or press keys (e.g. ctrl, shift, etc.) to generate entropy.

Why does the last example not work? Does tr have some kind of large internal buffer that /dev/urandom fills quickly but /dev/random doesn't?

",Aaron J Lang,https://unix.stackexchange.com/users/18799,"Generating random numbers for many security applications requires sufficient entropy — entropy measures how unpredictable the randomness is. A deterministic processor cannot generate entropy, so entropy must come from the outside — either from a hardware component with non-deterministic behavior, or from other factors that are sufficiently hard to reproduce such as the timing of user actions (that's where wiggling the mouse comes in). Once sufficient entropy is available, cryptography can be used to generate a practically unlimited stream of random numbers.

Linux works by accummulating entropy in a pool, then using cryptography to produce acceptable random numbers both through /dev/random and /dev/urandom. The difference is that /dev/random applies an extremely conservative entropy calculation that reduces the estimate of the entropy in the pool for every byte that it generates, whereas /dev/urandom does not concern itself with the amount of entropy in the pool.

If the estimate of entropy in the pool is too low, /dev/random blocks until more entropy can be accumulated. This can severely cripple the rate at which /dev/random can produce output. This is what you're observing here. It has nothing to do with tr; but strings reads output with buffering, so it has to read a full buffer (a few kB) from /dev/random just to produce at least one byte of input.

/dev/urandom is perfectly acceptable for generating a cryptographic key, because entropy does not in fact decrease in any perceptible way. (If you keep your machine running for longer than the universe has existed, you can't neglect these considerations, but otherwise you're good.) There is only one case where /dev/urandom is not good, which is on a freshly installed system that hasn't had time to generate entropy yet, or a freshly booted system that boots from read-only media.

Elimitating strings from your boot chain will probably speed up your process:

&lt;/dev/random LC_ALL=C tr -dc '~-!'


But you can use /dev/urandom here, as long as you take care not to generate passwords on a system that hasn't had time to accummulate sufficient entropy. You can check the level of Linux's entropy pool in /proc/sys/kernel/random/entropy_avail (if you use /dev/random, the figure in this file will be conservative, possibly very much so).

","Generating random numbers for many security applications requires sufficient entropy — entropy measures how unpredictable the randomness is. A deterministic processor cannot generate entropy, so entropy must come from the outside — either from a hardware component with non-deterministic behavior, or from other factors that are sufficiently hard to reproduce such as the timing of user actions (that's where wiggling the mouse comes in). Once sufficient entropy is available, cryptography can be used to generate a practically unlimited stream of random numbers.

Linux works by accummulating entropy in a pool, then using cryptography to produce acceptable random numbers both through /dev/random and /dev/urandom. The difference is that /dev/random applies an extremely conservative entropy calculation that reduces the estimate of the entropy in the pool for every byte that it generates, whereas /dev/urandom does not concern itself with the amount of entropy in the pool.

If the estimate of entropy in the pool is too low, /dev/random blocks until more entropy can be accumulated. This can severely cripple the rate at which /dev/random can produce output. This is what you're observing here. It has nothing to do with tr; but strings reads output with buffering, so it has to read a full buffer (a few kB) from /dev/random just to produce at least one byte of input.

/dev/urandom is perfectly acceptable for generating a cryptographic key, because entropy does not in fact decrease in any perceptible way. (If you keep your machine running for longer than the universe has existed, you can't neglect these considerations, but otherwise you're good.) There is only one case where /dev/urandom is not good, which is on a freshly installed system that hasn't had time to generate entropy yet, or a freshly booted system that boots from read-only media.

Elimitating strings from your boot chain will probably speed up your process:

&lt;/dev/random LC_ALL=C tr -dc '~-!'


But you can use /dev/urandom here, as long as you take care not to generate passwords on a system that hasn't had time to accummulate sufficient entropy. You can check the level of Linux's entropy pool in /proc/sys/kernel/random/entropy_avail (if you use /dev/random, the figure in this file will be conservative, possibly very much so).

4155,4155,6626,Circuit to control a impulse solenoid valve from a movement detector,"I have a movement detector sensor that generate a pulse (3.3V TTL) for 60 seconds when something moves in front of it.

What would be the simplest and cheapest way to drive the solenoid from the movement detector?

The circuit or chip should produce +3.6V output for at least 30ms when the input signal goes to 3.3V and then produce -3.6V for at least 30ms when the input signal goes low (0V).

",Pat,https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/27887,"Normally I wouldn't do a bespoke design (especially for free) but this problem has a lot of common themes with other questions being asked so I thought it would be a good exercise to go through it in the hope that my solution (or parts of it) could be used elsewhere. Apologies for its length. MOSFET types should be able to switch a few amps and be of the 'digital' type (low gate turn on voltages).

Problems:

(1) the solenoid valve requires a positive pulse and a negative pulse (of about 30mS) to open an close it. 

(2) the sensor outputs a single pulse of about 60 seconds.

(3) the Pump requires a 3v6 pulse at about 500mA

Assumptions:

(1) the pump valve stays ON or OFF depending on the last pulse

(2) You want to turn the valve ON at the beginning of the sensor pulse and OFF at the end.

I noticed the valve has only two wires so rather than positive and negative pulses its more reversing current direction. For a single supply that would suggest some form of changeover switch or an H bridge. I chose to go with a MOSFET H bridge and worked out from there.

The circuit:



THE H BRIDGE: Q3,Q4,Q5,Q6

MOSFETs Q3,Q4,Q5,Q6 and Diodes D1,D2,D3 and D4 form a fairly conventional H Bridge using P channel MOSFETS at the top and N channel at the bottom. IC1d is a CMOS schmitt inverter gate that switches the opposite sides of the bridge. A LOW on the gate turns  Q3 ON  and turns Q4 OFF. The inverter output (HIGH) turns ON Q6  and turns Q5 OFF. Current direction will be left to right through the valve (current forward). 

A HIGH on the Q4 MOSFET gate turns it Q4 ON but turns Q3 OFF . The output from the inverter (LOW) turns Q5 ON and turns Q6 OFF. The output current direction is now right to left. (Current reversed).

CURRENT PULSE POWER CONTROL: (Q1,Q2)

If the H bridge was powered all the time the valve would burn out. 

Q1 is normally held OFF by R1. This part of the circuit only allows the H Bridge to work when it is Q1 is turned ON. 

When the gate of Q2 is taken HIGH by the 30mS pulse it switches ON and pulls the gate of Q1 to ground, turning it ON as well. When the pulse returns to LOW it is turned OFF

TIMING CIRCUIT: (R3,C1, IC1b, IC1c and IC2a)

I could have used a simple 8 pin micro-controller for this section but chose to do it with with a few simple logic gates.

IC1a acts simply as an inverting buffer taking the 60 second pulse at its input. 

One of the inputs to the XOR gate is taken through a simple RC delay circuit (R3, C1). When there is a change in the state (HIGH-> LOW or LOW->HIGH) of the incoming pulse this RC delay will cause the output of the XOR gate to go HIGH for the delay period. (Dual edge triggered monostable)

Eventually the two inputs of the gate will be the same and then the output of the gate will go LOW. In other words we get a pulse after the rising AND falling edges of the input signal (frequency doubler). If we set this delay pulse to be about 30mS it is exactly what we require for the input to Q1,Q2.  

The direction of the current passing through the bridge is controlled by the input signal as it will be HIGH (detected) or LOW (timed out) at the time of the pulse.

5128,5128,8158,Drywall - final joint compound coat,"While remodeling an older house (where nothing is quite straight) we used fiber glass mesh joint tape and 3 coats of joint compound. The first coat was applied with a 4 inch knife, the second with an 8 inch and ending the third on a 12 inch knife. I can still see the texture from the mesh tape I used on some of the joints.

I hoped that a coat of primer would level it off, but after using Kilz 2 primer I can still see the tape in some spots. :(

Sanding through the primer now proves difficult (doesn't work) with a medium grit sanding block.

Should I add another coat? I could never quite get the joint compound to adhere over the mesh tape. I've always been taught to go as thin as I can on the joint compound to reduce the sanding part. Did I go too thin? 

I'm hoping a second coat of primer and 2 coats of the final latex paint hides it, but I know this isn't the right answer. How can I fix this?



following what doresoom and shirlock said; i just applied a coat with the 12 inch knife practically against the wall (accidentally touching the wall with the handle once or twice) - more or less dragging the compound across the surface

this produced the result explained - about 1/32nd ? thickness of mud, covering the tape that i'll need to feather round the edges

i miss spoke earlier - i was using a sponge sanding block (not strait paper sand paper)

now that the primer has dried (did it saturday) its not as bad as i thought it was, but this is the right way to do it (not covering it with paint)

just as a side, we've used sherwin williams paint throughout the house and although its great paint (IMO) the plaster and lath walls that remain, even those repairs show through - and if those do, than this new work will... may as well do finish it right...

thanks for the help guys - i'll check this coat tomorrow and give a last one with the soap and water if it needs it.
",lsiunsuex,https://diy.stackexchange.com/users/1154,"I know this isn't the answer you want to hear, but I don't think priming and painting will hide the tape. 

Before you apply any more primer, I'd add another thicker coat of mud. Slather on the mud thick first - it doesn't have to be smooth. Then smooth it out by angling your 12"" knife so it's almost parallel with the drywall as you drag it along the surface. You'll have to press fairly firmly in order to avoid air gaps appearing in the thick coat you're smoothing out.

You may have to get a feel for it. If you push too hard and can see the tape again, redo that section until you get it just right.

Wait for the thicker coat to dry, then sand the edges as smooth as you can get them. Very carefully/lightly sand over area covering the tape if you didn't get it quite smooth. You may need to do a second coat along both sides of the thicker coat to make it join the drywall surface smoothly.

In other term : a somewhat responsive design.

Using the simulator via Visual Studio 2013, I can test multiple screen and it seems my app is not behaving correctly at all.

I also used the simulator to see how some of Windows 8/8.1 built-in apps behaved : it's splendid and clean.

How can I achieve this much ?

I already found a partial answer for my grid : Windows 8 App Screen Layout

but it is not enough.

This picture shows what I am trying to do :

813,813,1289,Refinance FHA 203k to conventional,"I am thinking of getting a streamlined FHA 203k loan for a home. The loan is for $101,300. The best offer I could find is 4% interest, but because of required insurance fees, I would pay $630.13 a month for 360 months. In the end, I will end up paying $226,846.8. I was told that after a year I could refinance to a conventional loan with a lower rate (currently at 3.75%) and ditch the mandatory FHA mortgage insurance fee (currently $113.05).

Assuming the interest would be lower than what I have now 4%, hopefully staying at 3.75%, would it be wise to refinance after a year so I can loose the $113.05 required mortgage insurance fee and hopefully lower my monthly payments or just keep the loan as it is. Since I guess the new refinance will take into account the original loan amount plus the interest. Please correct me if I am wrong. There is a $25 Hazard insurance fee in the monthly payment which I doubt I can get rid of.

Usually all words have a stressed syllable, those who don't have such feature are usually monosyllables (they are typically function words or grammatical words/particles), and so they have a weak form and a strong form.

As you can see, ""but"" is on the list. The pronunciations you listed for it, [bʌt] and [bət], are respectively the strong form and the weak form.

Now, I don't remember exactly all the cases (I should look back in my notes because I did this at university), but usually the weak form is used in normal speech, unless you emphasize it then you use the strong form. Another distinction is between ""particle used at the end of the sentence"" vs. ""particle used before a noun"", for example:

I found what I'm looking for. --> [fɔː(r)]
I'm looking for money. ---------> [fə(r)]

Look here if you want to hear the pronunciation. (Check the BrE one, it gives the idea better.)

Now, I don't remember exactly all the cases (I should look back in my notes because I did this at university), but usually the weak form is used in normal speech, unless you emphasize it then you use the strong form. Another distinction is between ""particle used at the end of the sentence"" vs. ""particle used before a noun"", for example:

I found what I'm looking for. --> [fɔː(r)]
I'm looking for money. ---------> [fə(r)]

Look here if you want to hear the pronunciation. (Check the BrE one, it gives the idea better.)

Most packaged Apache versions create a symbolic link from /etc/httpd/logs to /var/log/httpd. Either the actual directory in /etc/httpd is missing (or the root filesystem is full) or the symbolic link may be missing in your setup.

Apache gets started by root and opens the log files as root before dropping privileges so those directory permissions on /var/log/httpd seem correct.

 2. How can I recreate the logs and make sure data is written to them?
 3. Which permissions should be set on `/var/log/httpd`? (current permissions are: drwx------ 2 root root)


Thanks in advance
","When path references in an Apache configuration are not absolute (i.e. don't start with /) they are relative to the directory set in the ServerRoot directive. A common default for the ServerRoot is  /etc/httpd making /etc/httpd/logs your log directory. 

Most packaged Apache versions create a symbolic link from /etc/httpd/logs to /var/log/httpd. Either the actual directory in /etc/httpd is missing (or the root filesystem is full) or the symbolic link may be missing in your setup.

Apache gets started by root and opens the log files as root before dropping privileges so those directory permissions on /var/log/httpd seem correct.

what i want is 2 (actually 5) divs next to eachother with the class ""container"" so i can make a horizontal 1page website. Each div has to be 100% wide. so 2 divs mean 2 screens next to eachother.

Ok, I showed that $k(x)$ is irreducible since it it a quadratic and has no linear factors.

A field constructed with $k(x)$ would have order $11^2=121$...and so the multiplicative group would have $120$ elements.

I figured that it would be ridiculous for a question like this to result in $k(x)$ being primitive, but what if it were? Would I really have to calculate $x^1,x^2,...,x^{120}$ in order to demonstrate this? Is there a much more efficient way of solving a problem like this?

1997,1997,3190,Woocommerce: change user role after completing order,":)

I'm using wordpress with woocommerce, and I would like to automate the following step. When an order is completed, I would like to change the user role associated with that order id from 'customer' to 'subscriber'.



By searching around, I think I should be able to accomplish this by using a hook in functions.php:

add_action( 'woocommerce_order_status_completed', 'change_role_from_customer_to_subscriber' );


Then add the function:

function change_role_from_customer_to_subscriber($order_id){
// code to change role to subscriber
}


In the code, I think I need to do 2 things:
1) get the user id that is associated with that order id
2) change role of that user id to subscriber



I've tried a lot, but I couldn't get it to work (neither getting the right user id, nor changing the role of a user id). So any help would be appreciated! I've seen 2 related questions asked before on stack overflow, but unfortunately the answers there did not work for me. I hope someone can help me out!

Thanks a lot! :)


Edit:
Someone helped me out with the second part of the problem, so that's great news for me :)

Unfortunately, I still haven't figured out the first part: how to get the user id that is associated with the order id.
Any ideas?

"
4971,4971,7918,Drywall - final joint compound coat,"While remodeling an older house (where nothing is quite straight) we used fiber glass mesh joint tape and 3 coats of joint compound. The first coat was applied with a 4 inch knife, the second with an 8 inch and ending the third on a 12 inch knife. I can still see the texture from the mesh tape I used on some of the joints.

I hoped that a coat of primer would level it off, but after using Kilz 2 primer I can still see the tape in some spots. :(

Sanding through the primer now proves difficult (doesn't work) with a medium grit sanding block.

Should I add another coat? I could never quite get the joint compound to adhere over the mesh tape. I've always been taught to go as thin as I can on the joint compound to reduce the sanding part. Did I go too thin? 

I'm hoping a second coat of primer and 2 coats of the final latex paint hides it, but I know this isn't the right answer. How can I fix this?



following what doresoom and shirlock said; i just applied a coat with the 12 inch knife practically against the wall (accidentally touching the wall with the handle once or twice) - more or less dragging the compound across the surface

this produced the result explained - about 1/32nd ? thickness of mud, covering the tape that i'll need to feather round the edges

i miss spoke earlier - i was using a sponge sanding block (not strait paper sand paper)

now that the primer has dried (did it saturday) its not as bad as i thought it was, but this is the right way to do it (not covering it with paint)

just as a side, we've used sherwin williams paint throughout the house and although its great paint (IMO) the plaster and lath walls that remain, even those repairs show through - and if those do, than this new work will... may as well do finish it right...

thanks for the help guys - i'll check this coat tomorrow and give a last one with the soap and water if it needs it.
",lsiunsuex,https://diy.stackexchange.com/users/1154,"As the others have said, paint will not help your situation.  You will need to apply another coat of mud. The final coat can be applied using a 12 inch flat knife, but I personally like a 14 or 16 inch bow trowel. The idea is to have a thicker coat of mud over the tape and bevel or feather the edges out wide so you will not notice the small difference in thickness.  With a 12 inch knife, your joint should be about 16 to 18 inches wide. Push harder on the outside of the knife than on the inside/center of the joint. This will leave more mud in the center and feather the edges better. Do this on each side of the joint. 

Here is another tip for you.  For your last or final touch-up coat, mix a little extra water and some Ivory dish soap into your mud.  It will flow very easily, far less tiny air bubbles, and will sand out easy with little pressure. Never use sandpaper, use a 150 or 220 sanding sponge. Don't go crazy and strip it too much or you will expose the tape again. Smooth the center gently and feather out the edges more agressively.   Good luck

The first coat was applied with a 4 inch knife, the second with an 8 inch and ending the third on a 12 inch knife. I can still see the texture from the mesh tape I used on some of the joints.

I hoped that a coat of primer would level it off, but after using Kilz 2 primer I can still see the tape in some spots. :(

Sanding through the primer now proves difficult (doesn't work) with a medium grit sanding block.

Should I add another coat? I could never quite get the joint compound to adhere over the mesh tape. I've always been taught to go as thin as I can on the joint compound to reduce the sanding part. Did I go too thin? 

I'm hoping a second coat of primer and 2 coats of the final latex paint hides it, but I know this isn't the right answer. How can I fix this?



following what doresoom and shirlock said; i just applied a coat with the 12 inch knife practically against the wall (accidentally touching the wall with the handle once or twice) - more or less dragging the compound across the surface

this produced the result explained - about 1/32nd ? thickness of mud, covering the tape that i'll need to feather round the edges

i miss spoke earlier - i was using a sponge sanding block (not strait paper sand paper)

now that the primer has dried (did it saturday) its not as bad as i thought it was, but this is the right way to do it (not covering it with paint)

just as a side, we've used sherwin williams paint throughout the house and although its great paint (IMO) the plaster and lath walls that remain, even those repairs show through - and if those do, than this new work will... may as well do finish it right...

thanks for the help guys - i'll check this coat tomorrow and give a last one with the soap and water if it needs it.
","As others have said, paint doesn't help your situation. You need another coat of mud. The last layer can use a 12 inch flat knife, but I personally like a 14 or 16 inch bow float. The purpose of this is to apply a thick layer of mud to the tape and bevel or widen the edges so that you don't notice any small differences in thickness. With a 12 inch knife, your joints should be 16 to 18 inches wide. Push harder on the outside of the knife than on the inside / center of the joint. This leaves more mud in the center and a smoother edge. Do this on each side of the connector."

Not that I'm aware of. Such a rule would be of little value, because -- unless you're practicing with a drum machine, or other device that permits varying tempo -- there's generally no good way (other than feel) to for conductors or performers to accurately measure their tempo during a performance. They're certainly not likely to be thinking ""Now this beat has to be played 10% longer than the previous one, and the following beat has to be 17.4% longer than that...""

However, if I had to guess a general shape of a tempo curve in a ritard, they generally seem to be monotonically decreasing (you don't speed up again in the middle of a ritard), and concave downward (i.e., the most ritard'ing comes just before the end of the ritard). But to what degree this is true is up to the conductor or performers to decide.

On the other hand, about the most prescriptive that I've usually seen music notation get is poco rit. (just a little bit of ritardando), or molto rit. (much ritardando). And of course, the dashed line that Richard mentions, to indicate the duration of the ritard.

That said, I am interested in what the tempo curves of actual performances would look like. I know that approximate tempo maps can be created for real performances, and I'd be surprised if someone, somewhere, hasn't researched what these curves look like.

4699,4699,7450,Driving electric cars through large pools of water,"The state of California is expected to be hit by a large storm in the coming days and there are frequently clogged drains in my town. I have an electric vehicle that seemed to handle driving through large puddles during the last storm but I was curious if anyone could tell me what the potential hazards are of driving an EV through a large standing pool of water. 

I don't need to worry about getting water in the engine (I think) since there is no air intake. There are fans that cool the battery if it gets too hot but I don't think that will be a problem during this storm.

EDIT: I have a Ford Focus
",Chris.Stover,https://mechanics.stackexchange.com/users/7751,"Electric cars use high tech lithium batteries. These batteries are dangerous in a variety of situations but they're also full of electronics to compensate. If anything at all bad happens (for example, a short circuit due to water) the battery itself will shut down, and you'll have to get the car towed.

Cars are expected to handle all kinds of weather and Ford is a reputable company. I would expect all high voltage power sources to be perfectly protected from water splashing up from the wheels which would mean shallow water is fine. If the water gets up into the doors though, then you might be in trouble.

Doing some research, I found someone who's nissan leaf that was submerged for an extended period it of time (the water was half way up the door, wheels totally under water) and the car computers had detected various faults and shut everything down. A mechanic cleaned things up as best they could and the car was able to start, but more errors were detected so they declared the car a write off.

My guess is that car could have been repaired if it was taken to a more competent mechanic, but most mechanics don't know anything about electric vehicles and they're not going to risk telling you everything is fixed when they honestly don't know.

Tesla says that there is no safety risk at all if the car is fully submerged in water, but obviously it would destroy the car just like happened with the Leaf. If the battery catches fire they recommend using ""large amounts"" of water to cool the batteries down. You're likely to need to keep the battery cool for up to 24 hours, so make sure you have a lot of water available to keep the batteries cool.

My understanding is water won't put out a lithium battery fire, but it should prevent the fire from spreading into neighbouring battery cells, and eventually the ones already burning will run out of fuel.

1956,1956,3117,Can the Mage Wars Warlock be played without any Demon cards?,"As the subject states, I was wondering if the Mage Wars Core Set comes with enough Fire type cards to allow the Warlock Mage to build a spellbook with absolutely no Demon cards. Without seeing the cards, I will assume that most, if not all of the other Dark magic cards are OK, but I would ultimately prefer a pure Fire Magic spellbook.

So as to preemptively answer the almost inevitable 'Why?', I will simply say that, as an orthodox Christian, my conscience doesn't allow me to play a game with such cards. I would prefer not to debate/explain this further, as I believe such a discussion is well beyond the scope of this site.

Since I don't know the exact centre of the propeller, that's what the for loop before the rotation is for. It finds the average of the y and z co-ordinates.

After I find it, I translate to -y,-z , rotate it, and then translate back. This makes the propeller spin as I want it to, but it also rotates along the origin >.&lt;
http://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/data/obj/cessna.obj &lt;- This is the object file.

groups is a vector of objects and each object has a vector of faces. I'm sure that the vertices and faces are being loaded correctly, since the whole model renders correctly.
",viraj,https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/users/9194,"OpenGL uses a column vector convention, which means the matrices must be applied in the opposite of the order in which you actually want the transformations to occur.  Just replace this:

glTranslatef(0, y, z);


with this:

glTranslatef(0, y, z);

Since I don't know the exact centre of the propeller, that's what the for loop before the rotation is for. It finds the average of the y and z co-ordinates.

After I find it, I translate to -y,-z , rotate it, and then translate back. This makes the propeller spin as I want it to, but it also rotates along the origin >.&lt;
http://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/data/obj/cessna.obj &lt;- This is the object file.

groups is a vector of objects and each object has a vector of faces. I'm sure that the vertices and faces are being loaded correctly, since the whole model renders correctly.
","OpenGL uses a column vector convention, which means the matrices must be applied in the opposite of the order in which you actually want the transformations to occur.  Just replace this: 

glTranslatef(0, -y, -z);
glRotatef(angle, 1, 0, 0);
glTranslatef(0, y, z);


with this:

glTranslatef(0, y, z);
glRotatef(angle, 1, 0, 0);
glTranslatef(0, -y, -z);


and that should fix it.

3361,3361,5363,Windows 7 batch search for email addresses,"Thanks in advance for your help. I have to do a task on my office computer which means I can't install any additional software, so I think a batch file might be the easiest way to do this even if it's not the most efficient (although I welcome other solutions that I might be able to do without installing software on my office computer). Also, please keep in mind that I have very little programming experience in your answers :)

Basically, I have a folder with a series of subfolders in it, each of these full of files of various types (text, emails, text-based pdfs, word docs). I also have a text file (or an excel column) with hundreds of email addresses in it. I want to use a batch file (or similar method) to run through each email address in the list and search against the contents of the various files in each folder like Windows Search does. Files which contain the search phrase should automatically be moved to a prespecified folder (possibly having to be renamed or put in a new subfolder as many of these files might have the same name). In the end, we should have one folder (as well as its subfolders) which contains no files which have any of the email addresses from the list in their contents, and another folder which only has files that has content containing the email addresses in their files (these can be in subfolders, or renamed, or whatever is most convenient, just not deleted).

(Since the list of email addresses is in Excel, another option I could entertain would be using some sort of VBA macro if that is capable of searching the contents of files within a folder recursively.)

I hope that this makes sense and I'm happy to clarify if it doesn't. Again, thanks for any help you can provide!

The article suggests that salted hashes are too easy to break and you'd want to select a password hash because its computationally longer to check passwords so you can not do as many per second.

I think doing 3 is bad for security and 1 is in reality the best option. What do you guys think?
","Why do you think 3 is bad for security? Really what you should be doing is using something like bcrypt to hash your passwords to avoid all this mess.

Bcrypt combines those properties. It hashes the password using a salt many times over to create a slow and secure hash function that produces cryptographically secure hashes.

1232,1232,1929,Is my interval training routine effective for mountain bike training?,"During these winter months I am currently attending the gym 3 times a week. On each of the days I start my training on an exercise bike with the following:


5 minute warm up
30 minutes, 1 minute hard, 1 minute recovery
5 minute warm down


I am using a specific interval training setting on the bike. I preset the training to level 15, which is a high resistance and as much as I can take.

Hard is a cadence of between 80-90rpm high resistance. Recovery is a cadence of 60prm and the resistance backs off considerably, I imagine to approximately level 7.

My heart rate towards the end of the session reaches 170–190bpm, and I am working flat-out. I turn 30 in March, am 5' 8"" and weigh approx 168lbs.

Does this training routine seem sensible for building strength and speed on the mountain? Should I be changing up the training with other types of bike training?

It is also worth noting that after the interval training I perform free weight strength training too.

I get the following in Zsh

tdA          
zsh: correct 'tdA' to 'tda' [nyae]?


How can you make Zsh not to suggest a fix for an alias?
",Léo Léopold Hertz 준영,https://serverfault.com/users/1944,"I've been using zsh for about 18 years now, and I must say I don't like the accepted solution. Here's why:

You need to figure out the source of the problem - determine why 'tda' is being offered as a correction option. What you have done is completely disabled spelling correction globally. This denies you some very nice functionality while trying to get rid of a tactical problem. It's like wanting to kill a fly in your house by setting off some dynamite just because you're too lazy to figure out where the fly swatter is: It may get rid of the problem, but you sacrifice a whole lot in return. :)

Until you can determine your zsh's current spell correction configuration, you should consider setting the value of the special shell variable $CORRECT_IGNORE to a value of 'tda'.

Here is the entry in the zsh man page:

   CORRECT_IGNORE
          If set, is treated as a pattern during spelling correction.  Any
          potential  correction  that matches the pattern is ignored.  For
          example, if the value is `_*' then completion functions  (which,
          by  convention,  have  names  beginning  with `_') will never be
          offered as spelling corrections.  The pattern does not apply the
          correction  of  file names, as applied by the CORRECT_ALL option
          (so with the example just given files beginning with `_' in  the
          current directory would still be completed).


This should help get you by until you can determine the source of where 'tda' is actually coming from. 

Also note that you can use the precommand modifier 'nocorrect' to disable spelling correction on a per-command basis. You could use this to do something a little hacky, but effective:

alias tdA=""nocorrect tda""
alias tda=""todo -a""


aliases are just tokens substituted into the command-line by zsh, and those substitutions are re-scanned for additional aliases. So the above should work.

Hopefully these alternatives give you a more selective approach to solving your problem, while still giving you the benefit of zsh's rich spelling correction features.

Good luck!

The first table has is the dump file for all invoices and the intems bought

Now i want to find the No. of items bought given the condition that the brand is Coca-Cola, the SKU is 200ml and the invoice no. is XAX1X2X3 and display it in another cell.



Now in the second table, i want to match the invoice with the pack size and brand from first table and put the quantity in the empty cell

So the row that is highlighted in table 2 will show the value 3 cause invoice T1411031400114, pack size 200, brand coca-cola has Qty as 3.

So as to preemptively answer the almost inevitable 'Why?', I will simply say that, as an orthodox Christian, my conscience doesn't allow me to play a game with such cards. I would prefer not to debate/explain this further, as I believe such a discussion is well beyond the scope of this site.

5623,5623,8918,How can I enable HttpOnly cookies in EE,"Update:
Thanks to Dom Stubbs, I have an extension to accomplish this now.  It is up on devot-ee and also up on GitHub.  Thanks Dom!

The Original Question

I am nearly through a security review of a new EE2 version of an existing EE1 site that I hope to launch soon.  One of the final issues remaining is to make the cookies HttpOnly.  I've tried doing that through this line in the apache config:

Header edit Set-Cookie ""(?i)^((?:(?!;\s?HttpOnly).)+)$"" ""$1; HttpOnly""


Using the dev tools in my browser I can see that it does indeed append HttpOnly to the Set-Cookie headers, but the issue then becomes that I cannot log in.  When I asked Ellislab they tell me that the cookies should not be being dealt with in javascript, which was what I expected the issue might be.

ExpressionEngine does not seem to use the session libraries from codeignitor, if it did I could set a config variable to turn httponly on, but it looks like the session handling code is in the expressionengine side of things.

The real question that I need answered is how can I make HttpOnly cookies work, but I guess that breaks down into some potential subquestions:


Am I missing an addon that would allow me to do this without a lot more heartache?Is there something wrong with my apache approach?  Are you able to log in if you enable that in Apache, log out and try to log back in?
Is there something wrong with my apache approach?  Are you able to log in if you enable that in Apache, log out and try to log back in?

Thanks to Dom Stubbs, I have an extension to accomplish this now.  It is up on devot-ee and also up on GitHub.  Thanks Dom!

The Original Question

I am nearly through a security review of a new EE2 version of an existing EE1 site that I hope to launch soon.  One of the final issues remaining is to make the cookies HttpOnly.  I've tried doing that through this line in the apache config:

Header edit Set-Cookie ""(?i)^((?:(?!;\s?HttpOnly).)+)$"" ""$1; HttpOnly""


Using the dev tools in my browser I can see that it does indeed append HttpOnly to the Set-Cookie headers, but the issue then becomes that I cannot log in.  When I asked Ellislab they tell me that the cookies should not be being dealt with in javascript, which was what I expected the issue might be.

ExpressionEngine does not seem to use the session libraries from codeignitor, if it did I could set a config variable to turn httponly on, but it looks like the session handling code is in the expressionengine side of things.

The real question that I need answered is how can I make HttpOnly cookies work, but I guess that breaks down into some potential subquestions:


Am I missing an addon that would allow me to do this without a lot more heartache?Is there something wrong with my apache approach?  Are you able to log in if you enable that in Apache, log out and try to log back in?

1511,1511,2378,Is my session-less authentication system secure?,"So, I've created an authentication system. Poured over it for any kind of security flaws and tested the crap out of it. I think it's fairly secure, but there is one ""different"" by-design aspect of it that's not usual of a web authentication system. 

Basically, I wanted to make it so that authentication could be done without keeping track of each user's session. This means less load on the database, and trivial to scale and cache. Here are the ""secrets"" kept by the server:


A private-key is kept in the source code of the application
A randomly generated salt is kept for each user


To make it sessionless, but making forging cookies not easy, this is the format of my cookies

expires=expiretimestamp
secret=hash(privatekey + otherinfo + username + hashedpassword + expires)
username=username


(with otherinfo being things like IP address, browser info, etc and with hashedpassword=hash(username + salt + password + privatekey) 

My understanding is that forging login cookies (not cracking the passwords) requires:


Source code access to the application, or a way to trick it to spit out the private key
Read-only access to the database to get the salt and hashedpassword


Whereas the traditional session method requires:


Write and read access to the database (to inject the session, or trick the web app into doing it for you)
Possibly source code access depending on how it works


Anyway, does this seem overly insecure to anyone? Are there any ways for me to improve on it and make it more secure(while keeping with the stateless/sessionless model)? Are there any existing authentication systems which use this stateless model? 

Also, the hashing method can be basically anything, ranging from SHA256 to Blowfish
",Earlz,https://security.stackexchange.com/users/1398,"Your basic concept is not new: you want to have some state associated with the user, but you do not want to store that state yourself. Instead, you store it on the client (in a cookie). Since you want to protect against alterations of such a state (e.g. a client building a cookie from scratch), you need an integrity check, such as a Message Authentication Code. Your construction with a hash function is a crude MAC. It so happens that it is a weak MAC with the usual hash functions, because of the length extension attack.

If you want a MAC, use a strong one, and that means HMAC. It is standard and widespread.

Of course, storage of the secret key (for MAC computations) is a tricky point. Something embedded in the ""source code"" of the application exists as a file, which (by nature) the application can read, making it vulnerable to exploits which obtain illegal read access to arbitrary files. It would be better (but harder) to arrange for the MAC key to be obtained dynamically by the application through some local communication protocol (the application contacts a local server, which gives the key only to the application); that way, the key would only exist in the RAM of the application, not as a file readable with the access rights of the application. It would not be absolute protection (if your server gets thoroughly hacked, well, that's it) but it would be stronger in practice.

I see that you include the hashed password in the data which is MACed. This is a bit weird; you already have the MAC as authentication: the MAC proves that the cookie data is genuine, thus there is no need for further authentication.

Blowfish is not a hash function; it is a block cipher (or a type of fish) and, as such, cannot be used for hashing unless it is considerably modified, which would mean homemade cryptography, and that's not a good idea.



If you are offloading state on the client, you might want to offload state which the client himself should not know. This means that you may also need encryption. Combining encryption and MAC securely is not as easy as it seems; there are modes for that. I recommend EAX.



Be warned that not maintaining state makes you inherently weak against replay attacks. That's unavoidable. You can minimize the damage by using short validity ranges (e.g. a cookie expires within 15 minutes).

Someone mentioned that he guessed the correct number five times in a row, and said that this was surprising because the probability of this happening was $$\left(\frac{1}{38}\right)^5$$

This is true if you only play the game $5$ times. However, if you play it more than $5$ times there's a higher (should be much higher?) probability that you'll get $5$ in a row at some point. 

I was thinking about how surprised this person should be at their streak of $m$ correct guesses given that they play $n$ games, each with probability $p$ of success. It makes intuitive sense that their surprise should be proportional to $1/q$ (or maybe $\log(1/q)$ since $1$ in a billion doesn't surprise you $10$ times more than $1$ in $100$ million), where $q$ is the probability that they get at least one streak of $m$ correct guesses at some point in their $n$ games. 

So, with the Roulette example I was thinking about, $p=1/38$ and $m=5$. 

I tried to find an explicit formula for $q$ in terms of $n$, and encountered some difficulty, because of the non-independence of ""getting a streak in the first five tries"" and ""getting a streak in tries $2$ through $6$"" (if the first is a failure, it's much more  likely that the second will be too). 



In summary, two questions:


How do I find the probability that you get $5$ correct guesses in a row at some point if you play $n$ games of Roulette?
More generally, what is the probability that you get $m$ successes at some point in a series of $n$ events, each with probability $p$ of success? 


The variables satisfy $\,\,\,m,n \in \mathbb{N}$, $\,\,\,m\leq n$, $\,\,\,p \in \mathbb{R}$, $\,\,\,0 \leq p \leq 1$.



If we write the answer to the second question as a function $q(m,n,p)$, then we can say that $q$ should be increasing with $n$, decreasing with $m$, and increasing with $p$. It should equal $p^n$ when $m=n$ and should equal $1$ when $p=1$ and $0$ when $p=0$. 

I feel as though this should be a basic probability problem, but I'm having trouble solving it. Maybe some kind of recursive approach would work? Given $q(n,m,p)$, I think I could write $q(n+1,m,p)$ using the probability that the last $m-1$ results are all successes ...

What is the Goal of Advertising Network Questions?

Before discussing how to calculate hotness, or how the list should be ordered, we need to come to an agreement on what the heck we are actually trying to achieve. Once we know what we are looking to accomplish, we can find the best way to do that.

The list of questions from a variety of sites is in a great location screen-wise, it is readily accessible and does get a lot of eyes on it. But as with any marketing, the goal isn't just to grab eyes, it's to grab the right eyes.*

So what are the right eyes? What type of people do we want to attract to our site? What would we determine as 'success'? How can we measure that success?

Please do not limit yourself to the very narrowly scoped topic above. Think outside the box if you'd like. On every page across the network we have a nice piece of real estate for showing off the rest of the network.

  38 “What is truth?” Pilate asked. Then he went out again to the people
  and told them, “He is not guilty of any crime. 39 But you have a
  custom of asking me to release one prisoner each year at Passover.
  Would you like me to release this ‘King of the Jews’?”
  
  40 But they shouted back, “No! Not this man. We want Barabbas!”
  (Barabbas was a revolutionary.)


Why were they so messed up that they would choose the rebellious, murderous Barabbas over the innocent Son of God?
",Andrew,https://christianity.stackexchange.com/users/65,"Mark 15:7-15


  7 And among the rebels in prison, who had committed murder in the insurrection, there was a man called Barabbas. 8 And the crowd came up and began to ask Pilate to do as he usually did for them. 9 And he answered them, saying, “Do you want me to release for you the King of the Jews?” 10 For he perceived that pit was out of envy that the chief priests had delivered him up. 11 But the chief priests stirred up the crowd to have him release for them Barabbas instead. 12 And Pilate again said to them, “Then what shall I do with the man you call the King of the Jews?” 13 And they cried out again, “Crucify him.” 14 And Pilate said to them, “Why, what evil has he done?” But they shouted all the more, “Crucify him.” 15 So Pilate, wishing to satisfy the crowd, released for them Barabbas, and having scourged Jesus, he delivered him to be crucified.


As Mark's version of this event emphasizes, the crowd was driven to cry for Barabbas by the chief priests who were at the root of the push to have Jesus killed. Why would they choose Barabbas as their alternative to prevent Jesus' release? The biggest factor, of course, is that Jesus was a problem for them - he spoke against them repeatedly, criticized their teaching and their ways, and taught many things that contradicted what they taught. 

But on the specifics of why the chief priests would choose Barabbas, I think there's a pretty easy answer to reason out, even if the Bible doesn't explicitly detail it. Barabbas, as John mentions, was a revolutionary. That meant he was trouble, but not for the chief priests. He was trouble for the Romans. He wanted to resist Roman occupation and authority in the name of Jewish freedom. It's not hard to get an oppressed people to cheer for someone who wants to end their oppression. This would have been a win-win in the eyes of the chief priests, because they were getting rid of a man who threatened to compromise their authority in exchange for a man who threatened to compromise the authority of their oppressors.

5781,5781,9161,Is research a viable business model?,"I have had the suspicion that it may be for a while and apparently not all is a product of my mind. Let me quote from an answer:


  In my experience, in UK and other European countries, the research
  funding comes from successful proposals to the relevant funding
  bodies. There are research centres that were established and keep
  going only because the staff there constantly submits project
  proposals (somebody told me that the success rate is 1 out of 5 or
  maybe even lower).


There are two questions here.


Can a company feasibly focus on obtaining funds in publicly funded research (as a business model) successfully enough to ""survive""?
Can such a company be started (nearly) from scratch?


In short, the company would be exactly like a research institute (or institution) except that it would be private.

Reasons why question 1 may not be feasible:


I don't see any company doing this kind of thing, i.e. there may be some, but there are not many, which means that it may be hard. It's a bad sign.
Public funds seem to be assigned to public entities, while companies can benefit from the collaboration and synergy, but they are expected to get their funding from their work as companies (searching for customers, etc.) In this case the customers would be the partners in the projects and the society itself, but again, this seems to be an ""innovative"" (maybe naïve, or even plain stupid) idea.
Research is a means for something, not an end on itself, that's why the business model should be on something else (point two) and that's why such a company would raise eyebrows on the mere idea of its existence. It may even be against some kind of tacit rule or even written laws.


Reasons why question 2 may not be feasible:


No previous history of success of the company, or products or anything means zero (or negative) trustworthiness and no projects assigned to the company.
No partners would like to associate with the company in a project for the reasons in point 1.
The most similar case I can think of are spin-off companies that are created from successful research labs, not from scratch.
OMG so much communism! Go to kickstarter you hippie!


As an example, a possible scenario that could be close to this: Someone writes a paper about a software system that does something not very novel in the state of the art but in a way that is very different from an architectural point of view, leading to good results in practical terms. In short: in theory nothing is new, in practice what was just a dream is now a reality. What is done remains the same in theory, but how it is done is completely different in practice (and now it works). Unfortunately only a proof of concept (PoC) can reasonably be implemented.

Would it be feasible to request funds to continue the development of this PoC (still very far from a commercial product) as a start-up or that simply doesn't make sense?
",Trylks,https://academia.stackexchange.com/users/7571,"In Europe, companies exist that primarily live from FP7 or, now, H2020 funding. They rarely contribute much to projects in terms of research, but often handle tangential issues, such as project management, dissemination, marketing, or association with standardization bodies. Their model works because (1) they do things that none of the research partners actually wants to do, and (2) because they are often SMEs, which is generally politically helpful to get your funding proposals accepted. Further, as writing grant proposals is their core business, they usually also have grant writing experts that have the time to actually keep up with the various changes that the european commission is constantly applying to its programmes and rules (something that many researchers struggle to find the time for).

Formally, these companies often camouflage as either consultancies or technology spinoffs. That is, you will not find it on their web page that their core business model is actually to milk grant programmes, as this is strictly against official funding rules (as a company, you can only apply for funding if you plan to commercialise the results, and you are not supposed to make a profit from the project itself). In practice, the project officers seem to tolerate these businesses - for now.


  Can such a company be started (nearly) from scratch?


You will need a reasonable amount of seed money, as the H2020 rules require proof that an organization applying for grants has enough financial stability to likely survive over the typically 3-year project duration. I know from one startup that wanted to participate in a project (for actual technology reasons) which was in fact struggling to cross this hurdle. However, if you have the required seed funding, I see no reason why you would not be able to start such a business. Whether it is a smart business idea is a different question, given that you are basically living off of a loophole in the current funding practices, and you can never tell how long this loophole will stay open.

1945,1945,3100,Could fish in plastic bags filled with water float like that?,"I saw this gif earlier and it bothered me how the plastic water bags with fish in it are not submerged in water like they would if we don't do anything special with the water inside and outside the bag:



Then I read the comments on the corresponding Imgur page (I'm not affiliated with the post), asked my friends and figured that this could actually happen in some unusual conditions. I'm not very knowledgeable in physics, but from what I know, the sea water would have to be extremely salty so as to push out the plastic bags. Also the bags themselves must be very tight, so that the plastic material which they are made of contracts to form a spherical shape. Fish may not feel very well, as it might mean increased pressure inside the bag.

The spherical shape of the bags could probably be achieved with just high external pressure, but I'm not sure what could make the bags take a form of a drop. Perhaps if that little bit of air we see was actually so much lighter than the air outside the bags, that it would stretch up the whole bag and even raise its contents above water like that.

Are my guesses correct? What other effects could cause the illustrated state of things?
",user1306322,https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/14198,"It looks like a bit of artistic licence was taken (gosh :-) ).  You are correct that, the bags would not float that high up -- at least if I'm correctly viewing them as having only a tiny air pocket at the top.  

The physics is simple: take the total mass of the bag+fish+bagwater, and calculate the equivalent volume of seawater for the same mass.  That's how much volume the bag must displace, so if the bag 'assembly' has low enough density, the remainder of the bag's volume will be above the seawater surface.

Then I read the comments on the corresponding Imgur page (I'm not affiliated with the post), asked my friends and figured that this could actually happen in some unusual conditions. I'm not very knowledgeable in physics, but from what I know, the sea water would have to be extremely salty so as to push out the plastic bags. Also the bags themselves must be very tight, so that the plastic material which they are made of contracts to form a spherical shape. Fish may not feel very well, as it might mean increased pressure inside the bag.

The spherical shape of the bags could probably be achieved with just high external pressure, but I'm not sure what could make the bags take a form of a drop. Perhaps if that little bit of air we see was actually so much lighter than the air outside the bags, that it would stretch up the whole bag and even raise its contents above water like that.

Are my guesses correct? What other effects could cause the illustrated state of things?
","It looks like a bit of artistic licence was taken (gosh :-) ).  You are correct that, the bags would not float that high up -- at least if I'm correctly viewing them as having only a tiny air pocket at the top.  

The physics is simple: take the total mass of the bag+fish+bagwater, and calculate the equivalent volume of seawater for the same mass.  That's how much volume the bag must displace, so if the bag 'assembly' has low enough density, the remainder of the bag's volume will be above the seawater surface.  It's identical to the way icebergs float.

56,56,83,Saving TinyMCE Base64 images with dragonfly,"I am using tinymce-rails-imageupload plugin with dragonfly.

When the image is uploaded via separate form in popup window, it behaves as expected (save image in datastore). 

But when the user drag-drop or paste image into TinyMCE, the imageupload plugin allows it. I tried to find a way to disable this behavior, but apparently there is no straightforward way to disable allowing image upload, while disallowing the past/drag-drop behavior. So I gave up on that..

Now, I'm trying to save BASE64 image in TinyMCE's content.

In controller:

def store_file
  @image = Resource.new :res_image =&gt; params[:file]
  @image.save
  render json: {
    image: {
      url: @image.res_image.remote_url
    }
  }, content_type: ""text/html""
end

def create
  @entry = Entry.new(params[:entry])

  # iterate through tinyMCE field params[:entry][:message]
    # if image tag is found
      # if value of src tag starts with ""data:""
        # then replace it with the output of
        # Resource.create_image_from_base64(extracted_base64_value)
      # end if
    # end if

    redirect_to entries_path
  rescue Mongoid::Errors::Validations =&gt; e

","I interpret this as B's question to himself, not to A, meaning ""maybe I should consider going shopping?""  And it's probably not even a real question, although the vocal pattern is the same as for a question; when written, a question mark at the end is the only way to indicate that intonation.

",Roman A. Taycher,https://askubuntu.com/users/669,"You can always (re)install a package using dpkg:

dpkg --install local-file.deb


In order to make a ""clean room"" installation, you can first purge the package and then install it again:

dpkg --purge brmfc7340lpr
dpkg --install brmfc7340lpr*.deb


You might need to add option --force-depends during purge, if some other package depends on brmfc7340lpr.

Update: Based on the transcript you posted, it seems that the
 brmfc7340lpr package cannot be (re)installed because its
 post-removal script is erroring out.

Those files are stored in directory /var/lib/dpkg/info; for each
package X, there can be any one of these scripts:


X.postinst run after the package has been installed, e.g., to
start services provided by the package.
X.prerm run before removing/purging the package, e.g., to
ensure that daemons provided by the package are stopped.
X.postrm run after the package has been removed, e.g., to
signal any service optionally using the package that it is no
longer available.  (For instance, a printer driver package might
want to signal cpus/lpr to remove printers depending on that
specific driver.)


Now, this brmfc7340lpr package seems to try to (re)start the lpd
printer daemon upon removal, which won't work as Ubuntu uses CUPS
instead: you should definitely look for a CUPS-compatible printer
driver -- see the link in Jorge Castro's answer. (I think this is a
bug in the package, as it should not restart the lpd service
unconditionally, but just reload it if it's already running.)

The best option to go forward comes from this launchpad
answer:

ln -s /etc/init.d/cpus /etc/init.d/lpd


This will effectively (re)start CUPS when the lpd service is instead
searched for.

Otherwise, I only see two options, both rather unpleasant:


Either edit the /var/lib/dpkg/info/brmfc7340lpr.postrm script,
and comment out the line that is invoking /etc/init.d/lpd start
(or restart or stop), (e.g., just replace it with /bin/true).
Another option is to just place exit 0 as the first non-comment
line in the script. This would be my favorite, but requires a bit
of confidence with editing shell scripts.
Install lpr, purge the brmfc6340lpr package, purge lpr: this
requires a bit of attention as lpr conflicts with the default
Ubuntu printer spooling system CUPS:

a. sudo aptitude install lpr (this will remove cups-bsd and
  ubuntu-desktop as a side effect)

b. sudo aptitude purge brmfc7340lpr lpr (should work now)

c. sudo aptitude install cups-bsd ubuntu-desktop (restore system
  to its original state)

361,361,571,Do real and reactive energy exist?,"Are there any such things as real and reactive energies just like real and reactive power? if so, how is reactive energy dissipated?
",Sri,https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/34625,"First of all, remember that in the context of AC (phasor) analysis, real and reactive power, unlike voltage and current, are not phasors, i.e., they do not represent the amplitude and phase of a sinusoid in the time domain.  Thus, we cannot ""tack on"" the time dependence and take the real and imaginary parts to calculate the associated energies in time domain.  

Sometimes it is helpful to ""go back to basics"" to gain insight into a problem.  This is such a case.  Reactive power is a useful concept in AC analysis but what it represents physically is best seen in the time domain.

First, consider a sinusoidal voltage source \$v_s(t) = V\cos\omega t\$ driving a resistor R.  The power delivered to the resistor is:

$$p_R = \dfrac{v^2_s(t)}{R} = \dfrac{V^2\cos^2\omega t}{R} = \dfrac{V^2}{2R}(1 + \cos2\omega t)$$

The key observation here is that the power is never negative, i.e., the flow of energy is from the source to the resistor always.  Thus, the energy supplied by the source increases over time.

The energy supplied by the source over a period \$\dfrac{\pi}{\omega}\$ is:

$$W_R = \dfrac{\pi V^2}{2\omega R}$$

Now, replace the resistor with a capacitor.  The power delivered to the capacitor is:

$$p_C = v_s(t) \cdot i_C =  V\cos\omega t \cdot (-\omega C)V\sin\omega t = -\dfrac{CV^2}{2}\sin2\omega t$$

The energy supplied by the source over a period \$\dfrac{\pi}{\omega}\$ is:

$$W_C = 0 $$

The key observation here is that the power is alternately and equally positive and negative, i.e., the flow of energy is back and forth between the source and the capacitor.  Thus, the energy supplied by the source over a period is zero.

But, as we know, the power associated with a capacitor is reactive power in phasor analysis, and now we can answer your question:


  Are there any such things as real and reactive energies


We have shown that reactive power is associated with an alternating energy flow between the source and load that is zero over a period.  In other words, it is associated with the energy that ""sloshes"" back and forth between the source and load without any dissipation.

287,287,463,Does this C++ static analysis rule make sense as is?,"I'm implementing some C++ static analysis rules, and one of them prohibits a function from returning a reference or pointer to a reference parameter of the function, i.e. the following are all non-compliant:

const int&amp; m(const int&amp; x) { return x; } // #4


The justification given for this is that ""It is implementation-defined behaviour whether the reference parameter is a temporary object or a reference to the parameter.""

I'm puzzled by this, however, because stream operators in C++ are written in this way, e.g.

I think I'm pretty confident that stream operators in C++ do not in general exhibit implementation-defined behaviour, so what's going on?

According to my understanding as it is at present, I would expect #1 and #3 to be well-defined, on the basis that temporaries cannot be bound to non-const references, so int&amp; x refers to a real object that has lifetime beyond the scope of the function, hence returning a pointer or reference to that object is fine. I would expect #2 to be dodgy, because a temporary could have been bound to const int&amp; x, in which case trying to take its address would seem a bad plan. I'm not sure about #4 - my gut feeling is that that's also potentially dodgy, but I'm not sure. In particular, I'm not clear on what would happen in the following case:

const int&amp; m(const int&amp; x) { return x; }
//...
const int&amp; r = m(23);

",Stuart Golodetz,https://stackoverflow.com/users/499449,"As you say, #1 and #3 are fine (though #1 is arguably bad style).

#4 is dodgy for the same reason #2 is; it allows propagating a const reference to a temporary past its lifetime.

According to my understanding as it is at present, I would expect #1 and #3 to be well-defined, on the basis that temporaries cannot be bound to non-const references, so int&amp; x refers to a real object that has lifetime beyond the scope of the function, hence returning a pointer or reference to that object is fine. I would expect #2 to be dodgy, because a temporary could have been bound to const int&amp; x, in which case trying to take its address would seem a bad plan. I'm not sure about #4 - my gut feeling is that that's also potentially dodgy, but I'm not sure. In particular, I'm not clear on what would happen in the following case:

const int&amp; m(const int&amp; x) { return x; }
//...
const int&amp; r = m(23);

","As you say, #1 and #3 are fine (though #1 is arguably bad style).

#4 is dodgy for the same reason #2 is; it allows propagating a const reference to a temporary past its lifetime.

Let's check:

#include &lt;iostream&gt;

struct C {
  C() { std::cout &lt;&lt; ""C()\n""; }
  ~C() { std::cout &lt;&lt; ""~C()\n""; }
  C(const C &amp;) { std::cout &lt;&lt; ""C(const C &amp;)\n""; }
};

const C &amp;foo(const C &amp;c) { return c; }

int main() { 
   const C &amp;c = foo(C());
   std::cout &lt;&lt; ""c in scope\n"";
}


This outputs:

C()
~C()
c in scope

There may be issues you haven't considered ...

Like your original version, the process will tend to recurse indefinitely until the server returns an HTTP error. You would have a slight challenge in writing the server resource appropriately, especially if, as is probable, you need to access the finally delivered text. 

With a little more thought, you could deliver all text in such a way that ""continue"" or ""complete"" is indicated in the text itself, or in an HTTP response code. For example, you could use response code 202 (""Accepted"") to indicate that the process is incomplete. 

I think this will work (with jQuery 1.5+) :

function LoadFromURL(url) {
    return $.get(url).then(function(text, textStatus, jqXHR) {
        if(jqXHR.status === 202) {//continue
            return LoadFromText(text);
        }
        else {//complete
            return text;
        }
    });
}


You just need to arrange for the server to return 202 for ""continue"" or 200 for ""complete"".

Thus, LoadFromURL() could be called as follows :

LoadFromURL('my/resource').then(function(text) {
    console.log(""After a series of $.get requests, the finally delivered text was:\n"" + text);
});

If a frequency is not specified, then they are referring only to its resistance and this is the value you obtain if you connect an ohmmeter between the pin and ground.
The diagram provided by Vladimir is the exact model.

I adapted and changed this code from the Wordpress Codex.

1. We show the user the entire list of serial numbers they can access and allow him to select one from the list (like how a select element would work on an HTML page).

Pros:


The user doesn't have to type anything in.
The user can't enter an invalid serial number.


Cons:


The list is likely to be overwhelmingly large.
The serial numbers usually have the same format and are often sequential, so it might be hard to read the list.
Data usage for downloading the entire list of serial numbers


2. We allow the user to start entering the serial number in a text input and have an auto-suggest drop-down with a filtered list of serial numbers the user can access.

Pros:


The user doesn't have to type in a complete serial number.
The user is unlikely to enter an invalid serial number.
Smaller list to choose from than Option 1.


Cons:


The serial numbers usually have the same format and are often sequential, so it might be hard to read the list.
Auto-suggest may have limited value since the unit has a barcode that we could read.

3. We require the entire serial number to be entered, and once we recognize the correct number of characters, we validate the serial number against the user's accessible list and show feedback.

Pros:

Simpler implementation
Significantly reduced data usage vs. Option 1 and Option 2


Cons:


The unit has multiple barcodes, so it might take a couple of tries for the user to capture the correct one.

Very similar functionality, is the below example I found online, is almost perfect if it weren’t for the fact that the example uses OpenLayers-2 (OL2) functionality which calls openlayers.js library (instead of OL3’s ol.js library). Sadly, swapping these javascript files out fails.

4632,4632,7347,Reliable way of detecting whether an Android app is running in 'BlueStacks',"I would like to ascertain at run-time inside an Android app whether it is running within the BlueStacks Android emulator. This is so I can modify the way the app runs when running inside BlueStacks.

BlueStacks does not support multi-touch so I want to implement an alternative to the standard pinch-to-zoom functionality my current app has.

E.g.

If (appIsRunningInBlueStacks){
    mySurfaceView.enableMultiTouchAlternatives();
} else{
    mySurfaceView.enableMultiTouchFeatures();
}


What is a reliable way of ascertaining the value of appIsRunningInBlueStacks?

EDIT Summary of answers to comments on question:

Ben, Taras, thanks for the suggestions. The Build.MODEL etc. values for BlueStacks are:


Model: ""GT-I9100""
Manufacturer: ""samsung""
Device: ""GT-I9100""
Product: ""GT-I9100""


This is the same model number as the Samsung Galaxy SII so it would not be ideal to use this for fear of treating all users with SIIs the same as those on BlueStacks.

CommonsWare, the app continues to run in BlueStacks even with the &lt; uses-feature> for multitouch in the manifest. In fact (also answering iagreen's question)...

packageManager.hasSystemFeature(PackageManager.FEATURE_TOUCHSCREEN_MULTITOUCH_DISTINCT);


... returns true! This is to be expected I suppose as the emulator is convinced it is a Samsung Galaxy SII!

Therefore we are still without a way of reliably detecting whether an app is running on BlueStacks without also throwing all Samsung Galaxy SII users in the same bucket. Any other ideas?

$this-&gt;magObject-&gt;setData(""agilityId"",$item[""id""]);

Without the setPath it saves fine, but with the wrong path (obviously).  When the setPath is included, nothing happens.  I know that there are devious magento elements at work that prevent writing to _entity tables unless certain circumstances are met but I thought I was meeting them .   I am already performing the usual

define(""ADMIN_STORE_ID"",1);
//...
Mage::app();
Mage::setIsDeveloperMode(true);
Mage::app()-&gt;setCurrentStore(Mage::getModel('core/store')-&gt;load(Mage_Core_Model_App::ADMIN_STORE_ID));


at the start but in this instance it just is not working.  I have similar scripts on other sites that do work.  Only difference with this site is that there are multiple store fronts

Anyone spot something obvious that I am missing, whilst I still have some hair left?

Oh this is using Magento 1.9.1.1.
","You are not supposed to set the path. This is calculated based on the parent.  Same goes for the level.
Instead you should set the parent id.

So you can do this:

$this-&gt;magObject = Mage::getModel(""catalog/category"");
$this-&gt;magObject-&gt;setName($item[""name""]);
$this-&gt;magObject-&gt;setData(""agilityId"",$item[""id""]);

$this-&gt;magObject-&gt;setStoreId(Mage::app()-&gt;setCurrentStore(Mage_Core_Model_App::ADMIN_STORE_ID));

1969,1969,3137,Is there a name for the number of values a variable can take?,"For example, a bit or a boolean can be either 0 or 1 so the number 2 is associated with it. Similarly, for a byte which is 8 bits, the maximum number of different assignments would be 2^8.

Is there a name for this number?

When we pass everything through our system that has ECMAScript, Java and MySQL, then a boolean does not have only two possible assignments. For instance, a false boolean gets saved as a 0 and the boxed value could be null so a boolean suddenly can get true, false, 0, 1, null or even undefined or &lt;missing&gt;.

I think it could get problematic in tests to guarantee that the values are not inconsistent. For instance, a value boolean locked could become null and then when a script or a layout template evaluates it then it will evaluate to false somewhere if the real value was null and similar problems.

So why don't we always assert that a boolean has the same number of possible values (2 values) and similarly for other types?

There is a mathematical term named ""arity"" that is something similar but not exactly, and statistics and probability theory also has the concept of ""event space"" that would be almost exactly what I mean. For instance, the event space for a boolean would be the set {0,1} which has cardinality 2 and that cardinality doesn't get preserved throughout the system, especially when data is passed as polyglots and/or serialized (json, jsonp, xml, yaml).

746,746,1181,How to determine directions of vectors of an electromagnetic wave,"I did an exercise which probably is quite popular,
in which you draw an electromagnetic wave and prove that it should
propagate at the speed of light $1 \over \sqrt {\mu_0\epsilon_0}$ using Farday's law and Ampere's law.

Basically if this is the wave: 




Let's say the E-field (red) is in the X direction, the B-Field (blue) is in the Y direction,
and the velocity of the wave is in the Z direction.

You take for example for ampere's law a surface in the ZY plane with a length L
equal to the amplitude of the wave,
and a width equal to $\lambda\over 4$
You do a similar thing with Faraday's law and you get the speed of light,
assuming you know that the E-field and B-field propagate in this manner.

I got the right answer but I wondered about this:
Let's say I only had the E-field and I know the wave propagates at the speed of light, I assume this is enough information to draw the B-field at each point.

But how will I know the direction? Both Faraday's law and Ampere's law say you need a closed loop integral and the rules I've been taught say
you go over the loop in a clockwise direction for example and take the 
normal to the surface according to the right hand rule etc.

But clockwise and counter-clockwise direction don't really give me much information in this case, so how can I determine the direction of the B-field

",DavyCrockett,https://photo.stackexchange.com/users/19616,"Short Answer

You should not actually convert your images directly into the printer space, as you then actually lose the ability to properly color manage your results.

For color management to work, each device involved in the process needs to be assigned a color profile. The image should be assigned an appropriate color space itself, and that is usually sRGB, AdobeRGB, or ProPhotoRGB. The color space, when assigned to an image, is the images color profile. The computer screen should be assigned its own separate color profile, usually by using a color profiling tool with a matched software package. Finally, if printing, the printer should also have a color profile, which is selected when printing actually takes place.



Color Spaces

Color spaces define how the colors of an image fit within the available known range of color, officially called L*a*b*, or just Lab for short. The Lab space models the entire range of known color as far as the human eye can perceive it, according to studies done by the IE in the 1930s. Standard color spaces such as sRGB, AdobeRGB, and ProPhotoRGB simply define how each color as it can be described by a computer map to specific color ""coordinates"" in Lab space. It is best to only assign one of these to your images. Which one you assign does not actually matter for the most part, however the smaller the space you assign, the more difficult it will be to preserve maximum original information (i.e. sRGB is a fairly small gamut vs. ProPhotoRGB, and downconverting my require multiple colors to reference the same colors in the end.)

Screen Profiles

In order to properly observe your photographs with accurate color on a computer screen, you should calibrate it. Screen calibration is usually done with some kind of device, a colorimiter or a spectrophotometer, which measures the color output of your screen and produces a custom ICC profile specifically for it, and the environment within which it resides. 

A custom ICC profile will ensure that your screen is reproducing color as accurately as possible, and your photography should not only look more realistic (which may mean less saturated!), but it should display finer levels of contrast between pixels better, so what you see on screen should be crisper and sharper. Having a calibrated screen is not a necessity, however it is highly recommended, as comparing prints to an oversaturated screen can make you wonder why things don't seem to match up.

Print Profiles

To print accurately, you need a print profile. Note that is ""print"" profile, not ""printer"" profile. A print profile actually takes into account the printer, its inks, as well as the paper being printed on. Print is probably the most complex thing to calibrate, as so many potential factors come into play, so it is not generally recommended to create your own print profiles.

Most paper manufacturers offer ICC profiles for all of their papers and a variety of printers. At the very least, the top Epson and Canon printers will have ICC profiles from most paper manufacturers like Hahnemuhle, Illford, Red River, etc. If you do not yet have the necessary print profile, I highly recommend finding them and installing them into your system.



Image Color Management

It should be noted that the print profile calibrates the printer, ink, and paper....NOT the image. The image is calibrated by its color space. For the whole entire color space conversion process to work, Image Color Management, or ICM...a component of most computer systems these days, will handle conversion for you. So long as each component involved is properly calibrated, the image viewed on screen and the image printed should look very similar. There will always be some slight differences due to the nature of print (i.e. printing on a warm paper while your screen is calibrated to a D65 whitepoint will result in a white balance shift between the two.) 

If you assign a profile for a different component to the wrong thing, such as a print profile to an image, not only will the image look wrong on screen, but it will likely look doubly wrong in print. Keep each component assigned its proper profile from the proper pool of valid profiles, and everything should remain consistent.

5940,5940,9412,Ad layout for programs - Illustrator or InDesign,"today I'm looking for some advice from folks who have laid out event programs. 

In this case, the client (a local nonprofit) has a famous keynote speaker at their event, and have solicited donations from local businesses. Each donation over a certain level = a full page ad in the program for the event. Most of them are ""Congratulations to  on your anniversary"", etc. with a company logo sitting somewhere (the businesses that send in their own camera-ready artwork will just have them dropped into place). 

I'm going to be laying each ad out in a template so they look consistent; my question to the GD crowd is, ""Should I lay the template out in Illustrator and bring each ad individually in to InDesign or should I create a template page for an ad in InDesign and lay each ad out in InDesign?""

Based on your experience, what are the pros and cons of each approach? Obviously it would be easier to lay each ad out in Illustrator (that's what it's there for) but I lose a certain amount of flexibility once I hit InDesign (the program will ultimately be laid out in InDesign).

  Obviously it would be easier to lay each ad out in Illustrator (that's what it's there for)


Actually, that's not really it's specific purpose. But it does just fine. If you'll be doing any kind of vector work in your ads it may be easier to have such a simple thing all in one doc.

On the other hand, InD does have the better type tools. And templated layout is very straightforward. If you wanted to share styles or colors across the ads (it works in some programs) you could even set them up as a book to make syncing painless.

It all comes down to where you're most comfortable. They are both capable layout environments for simple 1-page pieces. You'll be faster where you know the tool best.

I would avoid saving out the ads as PDF. Since you're controlling the whole scope (program and ads), link directly to the source files and if you have to make updates you can open them directly from the program and updating won't require another PDF export.

I've seen some implementations of promises that allow this - returning a promise within 'then', means that the eventual result of the promise is used.

I dont now if the 2 disks (the good and the bad) where in the ungrouped disks from the start

I bought 3 new disks from HP and place them in so now I have 4 good disks on ungrouped disks and 1 bad disk and also still 2 bad disks on disk group

  is there anything I can do to save the data from failed vraid5 disks?


No, you'll have to restore from backup sorry.

That said I did just want to clarify that you meant you have 8 disks, 1 disk group with two spares and two virtual disks using VRAID5 - is that right? I just wanted to get the terminology right as your question wasn't as clear as it could be.

I dont now if the 2 disks (the good and the bad) where in the ungrouped disks from the start

  is there anything I can do to save the data from failed vraid5 disks?


No, you'll have to restore from backup sorry.

That said I did just want to clarify that you meant you have 8 disks, 1 disk group with two spares and two virtual disks using VRAID5 - is that right? I just wanted to get the terminology right as your question wasn't as clear as it could be.

Can I suggest that when you get this back up and running you configure the disk group to only have a single spare, not double - not for such a small array. Then use either VRAID 6 or 10 (0+1 actually), they're much more resilient than VRAID 5.

2409,2409,3845,How to configure ssh tunneling with Putty between two RHEL servers?,"I'm trying to allow ssh access from a remote RHEL server to a local RHEL box via Win/Putty gateway. Basically, I'd like to be able to do 'ssh localhost -p 512' on a remote server so that it would connect to the RHEL server in the local network. The local network is beyond a firewall so I can connect from my Win PC to the remote server with Putty/ssh but not vice verse.

LclSrv----WinXP/Putty-----||-----RmtSrv

So, I've added the following tunneling settings to the current RmtSrv session in Putty (actually I use Kitty but doesn't matter):

R512 LclSrv:22

I expect that this would create a process on the remote server that listens port 512 and transfers the connections to a local network/LclSrv port 22.

After pressing start button, Putty opens a regular ssh terminal session successfully but nothing happens. (options show active port forwarding). I've checked with netstat -l that port 512 is not listening on RmtSrv. ssh on this port returns 'connection refused'. What am I doing wrong? May be there is something in the sshd_config that needs to be changed in order to allow the tunneling? Could it be user privileges on RmtSrv that prevents me from creating tunnels? I have sudo btw.

",spoonboy,https://serverfault.com/users/201265,"Local port forwarding scenario (rmtsrv has access to WinXP):

What you want to do in ssh terms is forward a local port to another machine and allow other hosts (rmtsrv) to connect to it.

So in Putty's Tunnel settings be sure to check Local ports accept connections from other hosts and add source port 512 with the destination lclsrv:22 to the forwarded ports.

Issues:

Basically, the peeves I'm having are as follows:


My first two functions seems to be taking up too many lines. The first one, subThousand, seems to be this way because of the check made against the last digit of a number from 20 to 99. The logic I applied was, if it ends in 0, use the ByTen list. If it doesn't combined ByTen and ByOne. While effective, I feel like it could use some real work since I think it qualifies as a DRY-violation. Even the final part checking for numbers from 100 to 999 seems to follow the same pattern. Alas, I've tried paring it down but I've honestly hit a roadblock on this one insofar as trying to come up with a creative and clean solution.
My second function, thousandUp is quite the disaster. I tried coming up with a looping function that creates a list of one to three-digit numbers, so that I can call subThousand on each of them from the front to the back (hence the arrZero[::-1]. At the same time, after converting each element in the list to a word, I concatenate it with the appropriate equivalent in the zGroup list, or the list of the ""zero-groups"". However, I personally can't find a safer and more precise way of landing on the ""correct"" spot in the zGroup list to start concatenating.

To get around this, I took the length of the splitByThousands array, adjusted for 0-index, and used it to get the appropriate ""zero-append"" (zap). Before the loop ends, I subtract one from its current value so that it's adjusted accordingly.
In addition, as I'm attempting to make the output as clean as possible, I add a "" "" to the wrd variable so it doesn't concatenate poorly with the zero-append, as well as add a "", "" to the zero-append to separate it from the next zero-group. However, there will be instances that there are no values for some zero-groups. To avoid showing stuff like zero million, I added a check inside. This is the part that makes me die a little inside:

for z in arrZero[::-1]:
    wrd = subThousand(str(z)) + "" ""
    zap = zGroup[lenArr] + "", ""
    if wrd == "" "":
        break
    elif wrd == ""zero "":
         wrd, zap = """", """"
    resArr.append(wrd + zap)
    lenArr -= 1



It works, but it just doesn't look good. Is it possible to do this in list-comprehension form or a better for-loop without turning it into more confusing mush?

I must admit as well that the last part of the code sucks a little. I've done a lot of str--&gt;int conversions inside the functions, then I did one more outside of them. On top of that, my approach to negative numbers is hackish at best (print ""Minus"").
",Manhattan,https://codereview.stackexchange.com/users/38300,"A couple of thoughts:


You only want to output zero in the special case when the number is 0. It would be easiest to handle that special case at the outermost level.
Use "" and "".join and "", "".join to construct strings from parts. The delimiter will be automatically left out when there are less than two parts.

""The derivative of a sine function is

d SIN(ω*t) / dt = ω * COS(ω t)
where ω = angular frequency = 2 π *frequency

and this derivative leads the original function by 90
degrees (a quarter period) because a cosine wave leads a sine wave by
90 degrees. This derivative is also different in amplitude from
the original sine wave because the cosine wave is multiplied by the
angular frequency. If we take the simple difference of equally spaced successive points of the sine wave (i.e. 20 points in a 20 period sine wave, 21 points in a 21 period sine wave etc.) we can cause that difference to have the same amplitude as the sine wave if we “normalize” the difference. Normalization is done by multiplying the difference by (1/ω). In the case the sine wave the angular frequency is 2*Pi divided by the period of the sine wave therefore the amplitude normalization factor is

Normalizer = Period / (2*π)

Using the normalizer, this difference function of sine wave now has the same amplitude as the sine wave and leads it by 90 degrees in phase (a quarter cycle). The amount of phase lead can be reduced with a little vector arithmetic. Vector addition of the sine wave and difference function results in a vector that leads the sine wave by only 45 degrees. Since this vector forms the hypotenuse of a right angled triangle, it is also larger than the sine wave by a factor of 1.414. We simply divide the sum by 1.414 to achieve the
correct amplitude for our leading signal.

In summary, we create a leading signal by taking the
difference of equally spaced successive samples of a sine wave; multiply that difference by Period/(2*π); add that product to the sine wave; and divide the sum by 1.414.""

I would like to use this approach to create a leading signal for a sine wave which always has a set constant lead e.g. the above approach gives a 2.5 point lead for a 20 period sine wave but will give a 5 point lead for a 40 period sine wave. Since I will always know the period and the difference between successive points of the sine wave, how can I adjust the vector arithmetic so that the lead will always be a constant 2.5 points (or constant 3.5 points, whatever?) irrespective of the sine wave period?

Apache 2.2 &lt; 2.2.16 Multiple Vulnerabilities

We use Centos, and the Apache version numbering is different from the official Apache version numbering.

For example now we install httpd-2.2.15-26.el6.centos.x86_64 and it includes all security patches released by Apache in recent versions.

The Centos Apache version numbering relies on the RedHat Apache version numbering and they do not change the base number (httpd-2.2.15) each update.
But scanners do not “understand” this and check that 2.2.15 &lt; 2.2.16.

Can you point me to the good document that explains the RedHat Apache version numbering?

Example of false positive vulnerability:

Apache 2.2 &lt; 2.2.16 Multiple Vulnerabilities


Our customers run scanners and they check Apache version related to the official Apache version numbering.

We use Centos, and the Apache version numbering is different from the official Apache version numbering.

For example now we install httpd-2.2.15-26.el6.centos.x86_64 and it includes all security patches released by Apache in recent versions.

The Centos Apache version numbering relies on the RedHat Apache version numbering and they do not change the base number (httpd-2.2.15) each update.
But scanners do not “understand” this and check that 2.2.15 &lt; 2.2.16.

Can you point me to the good document that explains the RedHat Apache version numbering?

Do you know if exist scanner that “understand” the RedHat Apache version numbering?
","All security tools produce false positives, and this should not be treated any differently.  If you are having trouble with this report,  I suggest seeking a different approach to testing,  perhaps one that isn't  dependent on a broken tool.

5225,5225,8307,STFT - DFT size of the bins,"Having some trouble understanding this concept, really could do with some advice.

I want my STFT to have the following parameters: NFFT = 256 overlap/hop = 128

Now essentially, the algorithm will work as follows:

1) Split the signal into blocks of 256 


This will result in around 72*265:

2) For each of these blocks, calculate against the Hanning Window 

3) Create a ""slider"" that does an overlap of 128.. So, in theory it would 
   therefore be: `size = 256 + 128` 


Therefore, when I'm computing the DFT for each of the overlapped blocks, will my FFT remain at size 256 or will the size be 256 + 128 If this is the case, does each block in the resulting vector still have to be of size 256?

Thanks  

EDIT: 

This is now my result:



But, compare this to a spectrogram in matplotlib



Where am I actually going wrong? I cannot make any sense of this. 

I've looked bat through all the data, the blocks are correctly overlapping, Hanning window is being applied correctly.

Could it be to do with the fact I'm using a 1D DFT? I.e. 

std::vector&lt;complex&gt; FFT-&gt;transform(complex_vector[0...n], 256);

The Original Question

I am nearly through a security review of a new EE2 version of an existing EE1 site that I hope to launch soon.  One of the final issues remaining is to make the cookies HttpOnly.  I've tried doing that through this line in the apache config:

Header edit Set-Cookie ""(?i)^((?:(?!;\s?HttpOnly).)+)$"" ""$1; HttpOnly""


Using the dev tools in my browser I can see that it does indeed append HttpOnly to the Set-Cookie headers, but the issue then becomes that I cannot log in.  When I asked Ellislab they tell me that the cookies should not be being dealt with in javascript, which was what I expected the issue might be.

ExpressionEngine does not seem to use the session libraries from codeignitor, if it did I could set a config variable to turn httponly on, but it looks like the session handling code is in the expressionengine side of things.

The real question that I need answered is how can I make HttpOnly cookies work, but I guess that breaks down into some potential subquestions:


Am I missing an addon that would allow me to do this without a lot more heartache?Is there something wrong with my apache approach?  Are you able to log in if you enable that in Apache, log out and try to log back in?

Directly above that is the set_cookie_end hook. As that receives the $data array of cookie params it would be trivial to create an extension with a custom setcookie() call. The following is untested but I think it should work:

function set_cookie_end($data)
{
    // Block EE's native setcookie() call
    $this-&gt;EE-&gt;extensions-&gt;end_script = TRUE; 

    // Set a HttpOnly cookie
    setcookie($data['prefix'].$data['name'], $data['value'], $data['expire'], 
        $data['path'], $data['domain'], $data['secure_cookie'], TRUE);
}


You can use Pkg.io to eliminate some of the hassle of creating the extension.

",Mike Wilson,https://scifi.stackexchange.com/users/38791,"''The Creature from Cleveland Depths'' was a short story by Fritz Leiber written in 1962. As noted in my comment above, an engineer devises a little clockwork/tape-based thing where a man can make notes and reminders, and the device would give the wearer a slight shock, a ""tickle"" when the time hit, reminding him to check his appointments. His friend, a marketer, stole the idea (which he was noted as doing often, something the protagonist cheerfully grumbled about) and released it, claiming his company had been working on it all the time. As time went on, the tickler was improved to also automatically remind a person to do routine chores, and to even inject drugs to help make them happier. By the end of the story, the engineer, who has refused the tickler, realizes that the ticklers have taken over.

One of the other odd details that stuck in my mind was that the marketing friend drops off a case of lifelike masks for the engineer, prior products of the company, and he and his wife have a brief bout of fun while she's wearing the face of a prominent actress.

","""The creatures of Cleveland"" is a short story written by Fritz Leiber in 1962. As I mentioned in the comments above, an engineer designed a small device based on clock / tape, where a person can make notes and reminders, the device will give the wearer a slight vibration, when the time is up, it will emit a ""tick"" to remind him to check his appointment. His friend, a marketer, stole the idea (it was noted that he often did so, which was the subject of the hero's exuberant complaints) and released it, claiming that his company had been studying it. Over time, tickling has also improved, automatically reminding people to do their daily chores and even injecting drugs to help them be happier. At the end of the story, the engineer who refused to tickle realized that the tickler had the upper hand."

Are the percentage taxes applied on the net price and summed or the first one is calculated and then the second one is done with the price we get after applying the first? When is the fixed amount tax applied? After the other two or the other two are done with net+fixed tax?

He makes several comments about Bach's music, in particular, as the title suggests. So, he talks about the fugues, sonatas and partitas, modulation, themes played against themselves, how Bach manages to get two or more musical lines going simultaneously and so on.

But I don't understand a thing about these musical concepts.

So how can I learn more about these musical concepts, so as to better follow the book's main ideas?

When Jesus came into Jerusalem on Palm Sunday, the people welcomed Him as a deliverer from the oppression of Rome. They cried, ""Hosanna!"" which means ""Save us!""

1864,1864,2962,Order of footnotes with packages afterpage and footnote,"I need to have footnotes in captions of figures and therefore use the afterpage package to keep the footnotes and the figure on the same page (also using package footnote for footnotes in figures).

So basically, I'm forced to put footnotes at the bottom. Others seem to have the same problem (other question, accepted answer puts footnote on bottom of page, but is manual; also for tables that might float and floats in general, where I found the idea with afterpage; also in other places on the web), so I though I might share my progress made so far and get input from others on the issue.

When using floats in an afterpage environment, the ordering of the footnotes at the bottom gets mangled up in some parts of the document. I managed to fix the ordering of the footnotes at the bottom with a dirty hack (see below), but the footnote number of the figure is not always the first footnote number appearing on the page. So I now have basically two questions:

$result = $this-&gt;selectRow($db,""tbClass"",""Active"",""Id='$Id'"");
if($result) { return ""ok"" ; } else { return ""nok"" ;)


it returns 'ok' on both cases.
Any idea what's wrong with it ?

Here is the other function :

public function selectRow($db,$tableName,$field,$where) {
        if($where == """") {
            $query = ""SELECT $field FROM $tableName"";
        }
        else
        { $query = ""SELECT $field FROM $tableName WHERE $where""; }

        $result=$db-&gt;Qry($query);


        if ($result) {
            $no_of_rows =  $db-&gt;TotRows($result);
            if($no_of_rows == 1) {
                return $result;
            }
            if($no_of_rows == 0) {
                return '';
            }
            if($no_of_rows &lt; 0) {
                die('Invalid query: ' . $sender .""("".$query  .""): "".mysql_errno()."": "". mysql_error());
                return '';
            }
        } 
        else {
            die('Invalid query: ' . $sender ."": "" .$query."": "". mysql_errno()."": "". mysql_error());
            return '';
        }
    }


Qry Function is the following :

function Qry($sql) {
    if($result = mysqli_query($this-&gt;con,$sql) ) {
        return $result;
    }
    else 
    {
        $err = ""Error: "".$sql. "" :: "". mysqli_error;
        die(""$err"");
    }
}

","Alright, so $result is a mysqli_result object.
You might want to fetch the first row of that result and return the desired column.

Replace

return $result;


with 

return $result-&gt;fetch_assoc()[$field];

What's going on here is string interning.  When you create a bunch of strings with the same value, .Net saves on memory usage by having all references to the same string value actually refer to the same string object.  (See this, for instance, for details.)

I don't really know why the ListBox behaves exactly the way it does, which is that the first time you select any item in the list, it selects both that item and the first item in the list.  But it doesn't unselect when you click on a new item because checks to see if the SelectedItem is different from the item you just clicked on, and it isn't.  

I got exactly the same behavior by binding a ListBox to a collection of test objects:

What is your reason for wanting to get up early? I get up early because if I don't, I will miss the morning bus.

Note that the question can really the same: why?  The difference is how the answer is worded:


Why do you X? I do X in order to .
Why do you X? I do X because of .


I think your intended answers are based on the fact that you must catch the morning bus to arrive to work on time. 
 - I get up early in order to catch the morning bus. 
 - I get up early because if I don't, I'll miss the morning buss. 
 - I get up early so I can make it to work on time. 
 - I get up early because I want to make it to work on time.

Following is a bunch of examples. I'm not sure if it's just me, but it seems that often the ""because"" answer is kind of worded in the opposite sense of the ""in order to answer"".  It seems like ""because"" is the driving force or reason, and ""in order to"" is a goal state.  Also, the ""in order to"" answer seems more cold/clinical/unemotional/to-the-point while the ""because"" has more emotion and  a broader set of reasons.  I don't know if this is just me though:

  （1）I get up early in order to catch a bus. 
  
  （2）I get up early because I can catch a bus.


How to ask a question according to “in order to catch a bus ” and ""because I can catch  a bus""?
","What do you want to achieve by getting up early?  I get up early in order to catch the morning bus. 

What is your reason for wanting to get up early? I get up early because if I don't, I will miss the morning bus.

Note that the question can really the same: why?  The difference is how the answer is worded:


Why do you X? I do X in order to .
Why do you X? I do X because of .


I think your intended answers are based on the fact that you must catch the morning bus to arrive to work on time. 
 - I get up early in order to catch the morning bus. 
 - I get up early because if I don't, I'll miss the morning buss. 
 - I get up early so I can make it to work on time. 
 - I get up early because I want to make it to work on time.

Following is a bunch of examples. I'm not sure if it's just me, but it seems that often the ""because"" answer is kind of worded in the opposite sense of the ""in order to answer"".  It seems like ""because"" is the driving force or reason, and ""in order to"" is a goal state.  Also, the ""in order to"" answer seems more cold/clinical/unemotional/to-the-point while the ""because"" has more emotion and  a broader set of reasons.  I don't know if this is just me though:

5991,5991,9498,Is my interval training routine effective for mountain bike training?,"During these winter months I am currently attending the gym 3 times a week. On each of the days I start my training on an exercise bike with the following:


5 minute warm up
30 minutes, 1 minute hard, 1 minute recovery
5 minute warm down


I am using a specific interval training setting on the bike. I preset the training to level 15, which is a high resistance and as much as I can take.

Hard is a cadence of between 80-90rpm high resistance. Recovery is a cadence of 60prm and the resistance backs off considerably, I imagine to approximately level 7.

My heart rate towards the end of the session reaches 170–190bpm, and I am working flat-out. I turn 30 in March, am 5' 8"" and weigh approx 168lbs.

Does this training routine seem sensible for building strength and speed on the mountain? Should I be changing up the training with other types of bike training?

It is also worth noting that after the interval training I perform free weight strength training too.
",DigiKev,https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/users/3323,"I think there are several issues with your approach for improving power on bike:


doing the same workout stresses the same aerobic pathway, since there are several ways your body can burn fuel it is worth exercising all of them. This means doing intervals of different length with different rest periods. Example: 3x(12+6) min on and off. The on part is similar to what you can do for 1 hour and the off part is half of that. Another example: 3x(3+3) min on and off where the on part is what you can do for 5 minutes, off part is half of that.
the intervals do not seem to be anaerobic, because of the short recovery period( anaerobic intervals need longer recovery periods ). They are either Vo2Max intervals or Threshold. If they are Vo2Max I think the workout is too hard, usually accumulating 6 to 9 minutes at Vo2Max in a training session is too much, if they are threshold I don't think the approach is very good, better go with a longer interval period since threshold power can be usually sustained by riders for 30 to 60 minutes.
if you want to endure in long events/rides you need to do longer sessions to have the endurance
heart rate on an indoor trainer seems to be artificially high for me, I think it is because of the poor ventilation. Also power on the trainer is much lower then going outside, so pacing with heart rate on an indoor trainer seems to be a bad idea at least this is my experience. Suppose your 170bpm is upper tempo power, on an  indoor trainer that might be actually upper endurance because of the artificial high heart rate.
for effective mountain biking you also need riding skills, these are not developed on a trainer.


I would try to look at the requirements of your specific events and target those, also try to do longer sessions on the trail to build the endurance needed to complete this events.

An alternate way is to get a generic mountain biking endurance plan and build on that, it won't be perfect but I think is much superior over what you have now.

Also, try to ride outside if possible, the workouts are better and you will enjoy the training much more.

I am using a specific interval training setting on the bike. I preset the training to level 15, which is a high resistance and as much as I can take.

Hard is a cadence of between 80-90rpm high resistance. Recovery is a cadence of 60prm and the resistance backs off considerably, I imagine to approximately level 7.

My heart rate towards the end of the session reaches 170–190bpm, and I am working flat-out. I turn 30 in March, am 5' 8"" and weigh approx 168lbs.

Does this training routine seem sensible for building strength and speed on the mountain? Should I be changing up the training with other types of bike training?

It is also worth noting that after the interval training I perform free weight strength training too.
","I think there are several issues with your approach for improving power on bike:


doing the same workout stresses the same aerobic pathway, since there are several ways your body can burn fuel it is worth exercising all of them. This means doing intervals of different length with different rest periods. Example: 3x(12+6) min on and off. The on part is similar to what you can do for 1 hour and the off part is half of that. Another example: 3x(3+3) min on and off where the on part is what you can do for 5 minutes, off part is half of that.
the intervals do not seem to be anaerobic, because of the short recovery period( anaerobic intervals need longer recovery periods ). They are either Vo2Max intervals or Threshold. If they are Vo2Max I think the workout is too hard, usually accumulating 6 to 9 minutes at Vo2Max in a training session is too much, if they are threshold I don't think the approach is very good, better go with a longer interval period since threshold power can be usually sustained by riders for 30 to 60 minutes.
if you want to endure in long events/rides you need to do longer sessions to have the endurance
heart rate on an indoor trainer seems to be artificially high for me, I think it is because of the poor ventilation. Also power on the trainer is much lower then going outside, so pacing with heart rate on an indoor trainer seems to be a bad idea at least this is my experience. Suppose your 170bpm is upper tempo power, on an  indoor trainer that might be actually upper endurance because of the artificial high heart rate.
for effective mountain biking you also need riding skills, these are not developed on a trainer.


I would try to look at the requirements of your specific events and target those, also try to do longer sessions on the trail to build the endurance needed to complete this events.

An alternate way is to get a generic mountain biking endurance plan and build on that, it won't be perfect but I think is much superior over what you have now.

Also, try to ride outside if possible, the workouts are better and you will enjoy the training much more.

Edit: Grzegorz pointed out that $t$ is in a compact interval $[\alpha,\beta]$.
Under this assumption the statement is correct.

Proof: Let $f,g:[\alpha,\beta]\to \mathbb R^n$ be the two real analytically parameterized curves which intersect in $f(t_i)=g(t_i), i=1,2,\dots$ different points. Then the $t_i$ have accumulation points in $[\alpha,\beta]$, thus $f$ and $g$ coincide on $[\alpha,\beta]$.

In the $C^\infty$ case the statement is wrong: Let $[\alpha,\beta]=[0,1]$ and consider
$$f(t) = \binom{t}{e^{-1/t^2}\sin(1/t)},\qquad g(t)=\binom{t}{0}.$$

2nd edit: Noam pointed out that my proof above was not conclusive. 
So let me try again: Suppose that $f(t_i)=g(u_i)$ for sequences of distinct points.
The $t_i$ have accumulation an point $t$ and the $u_i$ have an accumulation point $u$.
By continuity, $x=f(t)=g(u)$. Now we change both parameterizations as follows:
Choose a line $r\mapsto x + r.v$ for a vector $v$ such that both curves are transversal to the hyperplane $v^\bot$. Since both curves are immersions (if I understood the question right),
such $v$ exists. Now consider the orthogonal projection of both curves onto this line. In a neighborhood of $r=0$ these are real analytic diffeomorphisms, so their inverses gives us new parameterizations of both curves in the parameter $r$. There are still infinitely many intersection points of the two curves near $x$, but these intersections happen now at the same 
parameter values $r_i$ with $r_i\to 0$ without loss. Now my proof from above applies. 

I hope that I did not overlook something else this time. Many thanks for pointing out my mistakes. 

3rd edit: I overlooked again something (Thanks SJR and Ramiro). So what I proved is:
The intersection of the two curves contains an open interval in each curve. Note that each curve, as an immersion, is locally a real analytic submanifold.  

4th edit: Grzegorz, to the new question you posed in the comment, the following comes to my mind:
By a theorem of Whitney, any closed set in $\mathbb R^n$ is the zero locus of a smooth function. So take a set in $\mathbb R$ like the Cantor set which in uncountable, and a smooth function on $\mathbb R$ vanishing exactly on this set. The graph of this function and the $x$-axis are two $C^\infty$-curves which intersect in this set.

What do mean by: $K_1\cap K_2$ is not $C^\infty$?

5th edit: Grzegorz, instead of excluding Ramiro's example in your edit of the question,
you could reformulate as follows:

4th edit: Grzegorz, to the new question you posed in the comment, the following comes to my mind:
By a theorem of Whitney, any closed set in $\mathbb R^n$ is the zero locus of a smooth function. So take a set in $\mathbb R$ like the Cantor set which in uncountable, and a smooth function on $\mathbb R$ vanishing exactly on this set. The graph of this function and the $x$-axis are two $C^\infty$-curves which intersect in this set.

What do mean by: $K_1\cap K_2$ is not $C^\infty$?

5th edit: Grzegorz, instead of excluding Ramiro's example in your edit of the question,
you could reformulate as follows:

Consider two  immersed curves which are parameterized real analytically on compact intervals.
If they have an infinite number of different intersection points, then their union is again a real analytic immersed curve.

1106,1106,1741,Drywall - final joint compound coat,"While remodeling an older house (where nothing is quite straight) we used fiber glass mesh joint tape and 3 coats of joint compound. The first coat was applied with a 4 inch knife, the second with an 8 inch and ending the third on a 12 inch knife. I can still see the texture from the mesh tape I used on some of the joints.

I hoped that a coat of primer would level it off, but after using Kilz 2 primer I can still see the tape in some spots. :(

Sanding through the primer now proves difficult (doesn't work) with a medium grit sanding block.

Should I add another coat? I could never quite get the joint compound to adhere over the mesh tape. I've always been taught to go as thin as I can on the joint compound to reduce the sanding part. Did I go too thin? 

I'm hoping a second coat of primer and 2 coats of the final latex paint hides it, but I know this isn't the right answer. How can I fix this?



following what doresoom and shirlock said; i just applied a coat with the 12 inch knife practically against the wall (accidentally touching the wall with the handle once or twice) - more or less dragging the compound across the surface

this produced the result explained - about 1/32nd ? thickness of mud, covering the tape that i'll need to feather round the edges

i miss spoke earlier - i was using a sponge sanding block (not strait paper sand paper)

now that the primer has dried (did it saturday) its not as bad as i thought it was, but this is the right way to do it (not covering it with paint)

just as a side, we've used sherwin williams paint throughout the house and although its great paint (IMO) the plaster and lath walls that remain, even those repairs show through - and if those do, than this new work will... may as well do finish it right...

thanks for the help guys - i'll check this coat tomorrow and give a last one with the soap and water if it needs it.

2848,2848,4531,Is my session-less authentication system secure?,"So, I've created an authentication system. Poured over it for any kind of security flaws and tested the crap out of it. I think it's fairly secure, but there is one ""different"" by-design aspect of it that's not usual of a web authentication system. 

Basically, I wanted to make it so that authentication could be done without keeping track of each user's session. This means less load on the database, and trivial to scale and cache. Here are the ""secrets"" kept by the server:


A private-key is kept in the source code of the application
A randomly generated salt is kept for each user


To make it sessionless, but making forging cookies not easy, this is the format of my cookies

expires=expiretimestamp
secret=hash(privatekey + otherinfo + username + hashedpassword + expires)
username=username


(with otherinfo being things like IP address, browser info, etc and with hashedpassword=hash(username + salt + password + privatekey) 

My understanding is that forging login cookies (not cracking the passwords) requires:


Source code access to the application, or a way to trick it to spit out the private key
Read-only access to the database to get the salt and hashedpassword


Whereas the traditional session method requires:


Write and read access to the database (to inject the session, or trick the web app into doing it for you)
Possibly source code access depending on how it works


Anyway, does this seem overly insecure to anyone? Are there any ways for me to improve on it and make it more secure(while keeping with the stateless/sessionless model)? Are there any existing authentication systems which use this stateless model?

During this season however, the production crew knew that the old team members would still be a part of the show in some capacity.  Foreman eventually rejoined the team, Chase became the head of Surgery, and Cameron became the head of the ER.  

With that spoiler out of the way, the crew themselves did not know who was going to be voted off House's Game of Jobs.

Although this is not an Authentication issue, i think it is part of your Authentication.  Cause the server moved and now you cant access.

1135,1135,1779,STFT - DFT size of the bins,"Having some trouble understanding this concept, really could do with some advice.

I want my STFT to have the following parameters: NFFT = 256 overlap/hop = 128

Now essentially, the algorithm will work as follows:

1) Split the signal into blocks of 256 


This will result in around 72*265:

2) For each of these blocks, calculate against the Hanning Window 

3) Create a ""slider"" that does an overlap of 128.. So, in theory it would 
   therefore be: `size = 256 + 128` 


Therefore, when I'm computing the DFT for each of the overlapped blocks, will my FFT remain at size 256 or will the size be 256 + 128 If this is the case, does each block in the resulting vector still have to be of size 256?

Thanks  

EDIT: 

This is now my result:



But, compare this to a spectrogram in matplotlib



Where am I actually going wrong? I cannot make any sense of this. 

I've looked bat through all the data, the blocks are correctly overlapping, Hanning window is being applied correctly.

Could it be to do with the fact I'm using a 1D DFT? I.e.

1356,1356,2136,How soon after baking can you refrigerate freshly made fruit pies?,"How soon after baking a fresh fruit custard pie can I refrigerate it? Must it be at room temperature before it's put in the fridge?
",Deedee,https://cooking.stackexchange.com/users/36628,"EDIT: Although the question title says ""fruit pies,"" the question specifies a ""fruit custard pie.""  The following answer relates to custard pies and other pies containing fillings with eggs and/or milk.  Actual plain ""fruit pies"" generally contain enough sugar to prevent rapid spoilage and therefore often do not require refrigeration.  If you do plan to refrigerate a plain fruit pie, there's no significant advantage to getting it into the fridge quickly.



Pies do not have to come down to room temperature before refrigeration.  In fact, most food safety organizations recommend the same general policy for egg-based and dairy-based pies as they do for other foods: don't leave leftovers out for more than 2 hours after cooking.  See, for example, recommendations here:


  Foods which contain eggs and milk, with high moisture content, must be
  kept refrigerated, as bacteria love to grow in these foods. Failing to
  put that pie back into the refrigerator before it has remained on the
  counter for more than 2 hours can make a very merry celebration for
  the bacteria, but not so good for friends and family.


So, 2 hours should be a maximum before refrigeration.

As for recommendations about the appropriate time to let cool at room temperature, see here, for example, which states:


  Cool cream pies at room temperature for only  30 minutes after you
  take them out  of the oven.
  
  After 30 minutes, put them in the refrigerator  to complete the
  cooling and to keep them  cold.


While it says ""cream pies"" here, the guidelines above in that link imply that such guidelines also relate to custard and pumpkin pies.  (The first link above also says the same thing about pumpkin pies.)

Basically, the only reason to keep a dairy-based or egg-based pie out of the refrigerator after removing from the oven is to allow cooking and setting to continue.  Many custard pies will continue to set a bit while cooling, and putting them in the refrigerator immediately might ""shock"" them and disrupt this process of solidification.  Changes in humidity levels and condensation might also have unpredictable effects on the pie surface while it is very hot.

(As for concerns about putting hot food in the fridge, see links to food safety organizations on the subject in my answer here.  Basically, you shouldn't put a hot or warm pie near anything that's very perishable in the fridge.  Otherwise, you're safer getting it in the fridge as soon as it has stablized after cooking, which shouldn't take more than 30 minutes or so.)

2344,2344,3735,Ad layout for programs - Illustrator or InDesign,"today I'm looking for some advice from folks who have laid out event programs. 

In this case, the client (a local nonprofit) has a famous keynote speaker at their event, and have solicited donations from local businesses. Each donation over a certain level = a full page ad in the program for the event. Most of them are ""Congratulations to  on your anniversary"", etc. with a company logo sitting somewhere (the businesses that send in their own camera-ready artwork will just have them dropped into place). 

I'm going to be laying each ad out in a template so they look consistent; my question to the GD crowd is, ""Should I lay the template out in Illustrator and bring each ad individually in to InDesign or should I create a template page for an ad in InDesign and lay each ad out in InDesign?""

Based on your experience, what are the pros and cons of each approach? Obviously it would be easier to lay each ad out in Illustrator (that's what it's there for) but I lose a certain amount of flexibility once I hit InDesign (the program will ultimately be laid out in InDesign).

If they insist that insurance doesn't / didn't, then you're liable for whatever is left.

You can dispute an item to have it removed. They will contact the collections company and raise the dispute. If you've contacted collections, and they know you don't owe anything, they'll clear it when the dispute reaches them.

When the second Doctor changes to the third (from Patrick Troughton to Jon Pertwee in ""The War Games, Part Ten"" (1969)), it is forced on him as punishment before being exiled to earth. The Doctor was not critically injured or dying. The transformation was the Time Lords doing.

",Keo,https://scifi.stackexchange.com/users/16220,"Yes, that was regeneration.

There is no indication in Old Who or the New Series that regeneration is exclusively limited to being uncontrollably triggered by fatal events.

Although regeneration is usually seen in the show as an ""emergency fail-safe"" feature, we're also shown very explicitly that most Time Lords choose to regenerate for reasons other than imminent death. Romana is the most prominent example, although Borusa also comes to mind (the man seems to have gone through bodies like some people go through ties).

The Doctor just leads such a hard life that his regenerations come more violently than most Time Lords'.

The fact that it was forced on him by the Time Lords doesn't change anything either; the High Council has repeatedly been shown to have control over the regeneration technology (for example, offering the Master a new set of regenerations if he helped them in The Five Doctors). There's no reason to assume that the process they used to change the Second Doctor into the Third was not regeneration; in fact, their dialogue in that scene makes it clear that the process is identical to that which turned the First into the Second (though ""regeneration"" wasn't yet really a term being used by the show).

I would try my very, very best to avoid using the term 'cancel' for terminating the subscription. Cancel is generally considered to be a safe action. Here, you are using it in a more destructive sense, thus causing the confusion you noticed.

If you manage to avoid the term 'cancel' for the actual activity, you can resume to use it for the cancel action on the dialog.

5057,5057,8042,What is the best way for a user to select an item by unique identifier?,"My team and I are building a mobile app where the user will need to input a human-readable unique identifier (the serial number) of a single unit of inventory. Our system tracks the serial numbers that the user can access. We have considered three possible input modes:

1. We show the user the entire list of serial numbers they can access and allow him to select one from the list (like how a select element would work on an HTML page).

Pros:


The user doesn't have to type anything in.
The user can't enter an invalid serial number.


Cons:


The list is likely to be overwhelmingly large.
The serial numbers usually have the same format and are often sequential, so it might be hard to read the list.
Data usage for downloading the entire list of serial numbers


2. We allow the user to start entering the serial number in a text input and have an auto-suggest drop-down with a filtered list of serial numbers the user can access.

Pros:


The user doesn't have to type in a complete serial number.
The user is unlikely to enter an invalid serial number.
Smaller list to choose from than Option 1.


Cons:


The serial numbers usually have the same format and are often sequential, so it might be hard to read the list.
Auto-suggest may have limited value since the unit has a barcode that we could read.
Data usage for downloading a sizable list of serial numbers


3. We require the entire serial number to be entered, and once we recognize the correct number of characters, we validate the serial number against the user's accessible list and show feedback.

Pros:


The unit has a barcode that we could read, so this has the potential to be simpler than an auto-suggest or select-from-list paradigm.
Simpler implementation
Significantly reduced data usage vs. Option 1 and Option 2


Cons:


The unit has multiple barcodes, so it might take a couple of tries for the user to capture the correct one.
Typing manually would be tedious if the camera is unavailable or barcode scanner isn't working for whatever reason (lighting, etc.)


Which of these three is the best approach? Is there a better approach than what we have considered?
",Nick Saunders,https://ux.stackexchange.com/users/50391,"Well, if you can do this using barcode OR manual input, and you say serial numbers are sequential, so both teh barcode AND teh serial numbers will have common characters, you can do something like this:

      1.1.1 - on success --&gt; stop
      1.1.2 - on failure --&gt; goto 2

1082,1082,1710,Preventing player passivity in GUMSHOE?,"I really like the game worlds of the various GUMSHOE games I have (Fear Itself, Esoterrorists, Mutant City Blues) but haven't run it yet.  My big concern is that I've seen the ""ablative skill system"" kind of mechanic work very poorly in other games - players hoard their ""uses,"" or use them all and then sit on their hands during the latter part of the game session because they know they're not going to be able to succeed at anything and trying will just get them killed.  

In GUMSHOE, your skills are a ""pool"" of points that you spend either for benefits or for adds to the dice when testing.  You basically roll d6 + spend vs a difficulty, typically 4 for general stuff but often going higher.  Fighting works the same way, so if you have a Scuffling pool of 8, once you've used them all, you know you won't live through any meaningful combat.  

For those that have run GUMSHOE or similar ablative systems, do you find that happening, and what are ways to avoid it?  I mean, I don't mind trying to capture the ""downward spiral"" but it risks characters just checking out if they don't think whatever plot is at hand is really worth all their lives.

",mxyzplk,https://rpg.stackexchange.com/users/140,"It seems to me that there are a number of things that you could do to help ameliorate this sort of risk.

The first would be to allow ablative skills to regenerate more frequently rather than just at the start of a session. If you intend to have a couple of scenes in a session which require the same skills (such as a combat), allow the PCs to regenerate their skills between. This would allow for the drama of getting tired (running out of points) during a scene, without that scene affecting others. Depending on how finely tuned GUMSHOE is however, this could be unbalancing.

Another option would be to reward ingenuity, good tactics, good role-playing or heroism etc. with point pool replenishments after or even during the scene. Since it's more under your control, it should be less prone to unbalancing the game.

I have seen this sort of thing with players in card based systems like SAGA, but only with relatively new players. Once you've played SAGA for a while you realise that the best thing you can do with a hand of low cards is to play them and hope to draw better cards, so any solution to this problem is likely to involve players being encouraged to be more active, more inventive, more dramatic when they get down to fewer pool points.

","Here is a partial, possible solution. I'm not sure if this will work for you or not because it depends a great deal on what else is going on in your document. This reformats footnote markers so that they conform to the requirements of the citation style.

I've used a sample bib entry from the example file provided by the package and some of the code you originally posted. I've also noted a couple of other things I think you could improve easily in terms of options you are using.

\documentclass[british]{article}
\usepackage{babel}
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}% much better than OT1
\usepackage{mathpazo}
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}% much better to switch to utf8 if you can
\usepackage[style=british]{csquotes}
\usepackage[style=oscola,natbib=true]{biblatex}

3980,3980,6354,Creating Excel document is very slow,"Attached is a generic code I wrote to create an Excel file with x number of worksheets.

The problem I am having is that it's pretty slow, like 5 seconds a sheet. It was my understanding that using a for loop when creating the tables was ideal, but the issue seems to be with tables containing over a thousand or so records... still wouldn't think it should take this long.

Any pointers would be appreciated, also, if I am completely left field with this code let me know, up-to-date Excel code resources seem to be hard to find.

1048,1048,1648,Regular Expression to Match String Exactly?,"I'll preface this question by mentioning that while I'm far from a regular expressions guru, they are not completely foreign to me. Building a regular expression to search for a pattern inside a particular string generally isn't a problem for me, but I have a (maybe?) unique situation.

I have a set of values, say:


  028938
  DEF567987
  390987.456
  GHI345928.039  


I want to match a certain set of strings, such as:


Strings composed of exactly 6 digits
Strings composed of exactly 6 digits, a decimal, followed by exactly 3 more digits


In the above examples, the first and third values should be matched.

I'm using the regular expressions:

[0-9]{6}
[0-9]{6}.[0-9]{3}


Unfortunately, since all the above examples contain the specified pattern, all values are matched. This is not my intention.

So my question, in a nutshell, is how to write a regular expression that matches a string exactly and completely, with no additional characters to the right or left of the matched pattern? Is there a term for this type of matching? (Google was no help.) TIA
",Craig Otis,https://stackoverflow.com/users/88111,"^\d{6}$
^\d{6}\.\d{3}$


are the correct patterns you can test them 6 digits only and 6 digits dot 3 digits.

^\d{6}((\.\d{3}$)|$)

Building a regular expression to search for a pattern inside a particular string generally isn't a problem for me, but I have a (maybe?) unique situation.

I have a set of values, say:


  028938
  DEF567987
  390987.456
  GHI345928.039  


I want to match a certain set of strings, such as:


Strings composed of exactly 6 digits
Strings composed of exactly 6 digits, a decimal, followed by exactly 3 more digits


In the above examples, the first and third values should be matched.

I'm using the regular expressions:

[0-9]{6}
[0-9]{6}.[0-9]{3}


Unfortunately, since all the above examples contain the specified pattern, all values are matched. This is not my intention.

So my question, in a nutshell, is how to write a regular expression that matches a string exactly and completely, with no additional characters to the right or left of the matched pattern? Is there a term for this type of matching? (Google was no help.) TIA
","^\d{6}$
^\d{6}\.\d{3}$


are the correct patterns you can test them 6 digits only and 6 digits dot 3 digits.

^\d{6}((\.\d{3}$)|$)


will match either 6 digits or 6 digits dot 3 digits

Does anyone know why this happened? To me, it doesn't make a lot of sense if both the pans were equivalently hot with the same amount of oil to fry in. The hash in the non-stick pan also seemed to absorb more oil, but again, not sure why.

4.And Spring Security Configuration will go like this

1710,1710,2709,Roguelike Class Structure Makes Everything Effectively Global,"A brief rundown of the hierarchy of the game data objects:

Configuration - loaded from XML files, has Descriptors, among other things

Atlas - has a Configuration, has a CreatureInstance(represents the player's creature instance), is an associative array of AtlasColumns

AtlasColumn - has an Atlas(parent), is an associative array of AtlasCells

AtlasCell - has an AtlasColumn(parent), is an associative array of Layers

Layer - has an AtlasCell(parent), is an associative array of LayerColumns

LayerColumn - has a Layer(parent), is an associative array of LayerCells

LayerCell - has a LayerColumn(parent), has a CreatureInstance, a array of ItemInstances, and a TerrainInstance

CreatureInstance/ItemInstance/TerrainInstance - has a LayerCell(parent), has a Descriptor

Descriptor - has an associative array of properties needed by an instance to do its particular function

The most important thing in the Configuration are the Descriptors.  A Descriptor has all of the properties that are needed by the various types of instances. It has properties that drive behavior, what it looks like on screen, and so on.

So here's the part that bothers me:

Everything... EVERYTHING, from Atlas to TerrainInstance can talk up and down the entire chain, the reason being that if, for example, the TerrainInstance is a square upon which a player steps and suddenly a number of monsters are conjured around him, the TerrainInstance needs to have access to the neighboring LayerCells.  Or for another example if a CreatureInstance when attacking the player's CreatureInstance is able to take items from the player's inventory, and relocate them somewhere else in the dungeon, it needs access to a different Layer or AtlasCell in order to put the item where it needs to go.

An alternative that would appear to be ""better encapsulated"" might be a messaging system that sends little message objects up and down the chain and handles things at the appropriate level, but is that really any BETTER than just having the objects be aware of one another?

The game I'm writing started out with mostly hardcoded item and creature types, and gradually morphed its way into something similar to the more flexible roguelike framework that I've detailed above. I'm finally switching from C# to Java for it(the language is immaterial, however), and I'd like to not have missed something glaringly obvious that will cause great pains later when I need to refactor it.

So, the question: is the apparent lack of encapsulation within the data/business objects of the game demonstrate a fatal flaw in the architecture?  And if so, what is that flaw and how can I correct it before I get too far along?
",PlayDeezGames,https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/users/12875,"I've been designing my roguelike framework on and off for the past few years and I come to think that the traditional OOP approach doesn't provide a very useful abstraction for a typical roguelike world for the reasons that you mentioned - everything is so interdependent on each other that each class may potentially need to know about every other class. 

For example, AI routines should logically be a part of the Creature class, but AI potentially needs to know everything - the current dungeon map, the state of PC's quests, current World events etc. Even implementing simplest actions such as moving isn't straightforward: do you have a Creature.move(x,y) method and require every Creature object to know its current dungeon level, OR you have a DungeonLevel.moveCreature(creature, x, y) method? What if monsters in your game can move from one dungeon level to another - do you need an even higher level method, e.g. World.moveCreature(creature, dungeonLevel, x, y) ?

So in the end I decided to simply make most functions global, instead of agonizing over the correct location of each method in the class hierarchy, and use classes mostly as data structures. Now my Creature object doesn't have to link back to the parent object, and it contains only simplest code that doesn't need to be aware of other classes.

In short, focus on teaching them how to grade their own papers. This helps a lot if you provide a rubric. Do not tell them ""I will give you a  'D' if you submit this."" Instead, tell them ""Tell me what you think this paper deserves and explain to me why you believe that."" Then help them develop that skill.

They should become independent learners, even if they don't want to.

4012,4012,6407,Story about Big-Brother-like society where everybody wears a controlling wristwatch,"A future Big-Brother society where people wore wristwatches which both monitored their movements and kept them informed about their role in society. 

I don't remember whether the story was located on Earth or a fictional planet.
The book was read late 60's or early 70's. I only read a small number of authors (max 10) so I would immediately recognise the author's name if the storyline was identified.

Possibilities:
Brian Aldiss,
Piers Anthony,
Isaac Asimov,
Ray Bradbury,
Arthur C. Clarke,
Robert Heinlein,
Frank Herbert,
Ursula K. Le Guin,
Theodore Sturgeon,
Kurt Vonnegut Jr.

What I'm thinking now is how uncannily like the Apple Watch and similar products this was. This is the only story I remember that foresaw the wireless/digital age.
",Mike Wilson,https://scifi.stackexchange.com/users/38791,"To me, this sounds somewhat similar to the story ""Criminal in Utopia"" by Mack Reynolds.

387,387,609,"Excel VBA App stops spontaneously with message ""Code execution has been halted""","From what I can see on the web, this is a fairly common complaint, but answers seem to be rarer. The problem is this:

We have a number of Excel VBA apps which work perfectly on a number of users' machines. However on one machine they stop on certain lines of code. It is always the same lines, but those lines seem to have nothing in common with one another.

If you press F5 (run) after the halt, the app continues, so it's almost like a break point has been added. We've tried selecting 'remove all breaks' from the menu and even adding a break and removing it again.

We've had this issue with single apps before and we've 'bodged' it by cutting code out of modules, compiling and then pasting it back in etc.

The problem now seems to relate to Excel itself rather than a single .xls, so we're a little unsure how to manage this.

Any help would be gratefully received :)

Thanks,

",Phil Whittington,https://stackoverflow.com/users/223126,"Thanks to everyone for their input. This problem got solved by choosing REPAIR in Control Panel. I guess this explicitly re-registers some of Office's native COM components and does stuff that REINSTALL doesn't. I expect the latter just goes through a checklist and sometimes accepts what's there if it's already installed, maybe. I then had a separate issue with registering my own .NET dll for COM interop on the user's machine (despite this also working on other machines) though I think this was my error rather than Microsoft. Thanks again, I really appreciate it.

1100,1100,1733,How do electrical devices suck electricity?,"If the electric potential is 220V and some device needs 1500watts then how does it suck exactly that amount of electrical energy from outlet?
",Ron,https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/7253,"If it's a light bulb or heater, it's just a resistor.

First, forget that it's alternating current, just to simplify things.
Think of the power source as a really big 220 volt battery.

If it's drawing 1500 watts, divide that by 220, and that will tell you the current I in Amperes.
(That just measures how many electrons per second are flowing. An Ampere is about 6x10^23 electrons per second.)

To get the resistance R in Ohms, just divide the voltage V (220 volts) by the current I that you got above.
(An Ohm is just the number of volts it takes to push one Ampere through the resistor.)

I hope you can see that the smaller the resistance is, the bigger the current is, and when you multiply that by the voltage, you get the power.

So the way you make a bigger heater or light bulb is by giving it less electrical resistance.

If you want to go back to alternating current (AC) the power is a time-average, and it swings up and down at twice the AC frequency.
I'll let you figure out why, if you want.

596,596,933,How much of the English language comes from each of its influences?,"I was watching a video linked in this answer and it made the following claim:


  [...] like most words in English is derived from German.


That got me thinking. While I know that Germanic languages have greatly influenced English, so have the Latin and Celtic ones (and various others to a greater or lesser degree). Is it true that more than 50% of the English vocabulary is derived from Germanic roots?

More generally, can someone point me to data on this? I imagine attempts have been made to quantify the contribution of different languages to English; what were the results? What percentage of the language comes from each source?

Ideally I would like to see this expressed in terms of % of words but I am aware that, at least to some linguists, attempting to quantify vocabulary is anathema (to give a simple reason, all languages that allow number construction have an infinite  vocabulary by definition), so alternative approaches to quantifying this are also welcome.
