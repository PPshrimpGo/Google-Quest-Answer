1912,1912,3044,Spokes keep breaking - bad hub or bad build?,"Background information

A bit of background information (I'll try keep it brief): Last year I bought an old but unused bike, 5 speeds with internal gearing.

Apparently the shop bought a lot of bikes somewhere in the 90's (not sure), but never got around to selling them. When I bought it, it was wrapped in plastic, had been stored in the shop's stock house for about 20 years and free of corrosion.

I'm about 95 kilos, thread quite hard but rides exclusive to paved bike paths. The original, 20(?) year-old wheel lasted me a year with no problems. The front wheel is still fine and true. 

Spokes breaking - and getting replaced

After a little under a year, I suddenly noticed that a few spokes had broken. On closer inspection, quite a few were too loose. Should have noticed sooner but didn't.

I took it to a shop, where they advised me to have the wheel rebuilt which I paid them to do. The gearing being internal, the new rims and spokes were built on the existing hub.

After just two weeks, the back wheel suddenly began to feel wobbly on my way to work. As careful as I could, I drove the bike back to the shop. Almost all spokes were terribly loose.

They retensioned the wheel free of charge (of course) and sent me on my way. The following weeks, I periodically checked that all spokes were still tensioned.

2,5 months later, I noticed three of the spokes were broken close to the hub. Went back to the shop and had the spokes replaced (free or charge). 1 month later I noticed 2 broken spokes and had those replaced as well. They seemed less eager to keep fixing the wheel free of charge, and when I asked why the spokes kept breaking, the guy muttered something about the hub holes maybe had burrs due to wear.

Now, a few weeks later, I find another spoke broken.

My gut tells me this all stems from a bad build, that quickly lost tension and thus damaged the spokes. I find the explanation about a worn hub a bit far fetched, but I don't have the knowledge to dismiss the theory.

Questions

Is there any way this is not the shop's fault? - A bad build? Cheap spokes? Improperly tensioned?

Given the wheel's history, is there any point in keep replacing spokes, a couple at a time, or should I get the wheel rebuilt (preferably at the shop's expense)?

Could the hub in any way be to blame for this?

Thank you!

Update Oct 24th

I've been trying to get in touch with the manager of the shop throughout the week. Failed again to reach him this morning, so I figured I'd have a chat about my problem with one of the guys on the floor.

Tried to get him to provide at least a theory of why my spokes keep breaking, but not much came out of it really. He mentioned that he've seen, on rare occasaions, that a worn hub could cut the spokes (could be the same guy as I spoke to last time).

I'll check the hubs as soon as possible, as @Daniel R Hicks suggested. Due to plumbing work in our appartment, I haven't been home or able to check my bike all week.

If I don't see any indicatations that the spokes were put in the wrong way, I'm going to follow the advice most of you have, and take my bike to another shop for advice and repair.

Thanks so far! - I'll update you after I've payed the other shop a visit.

Update Nov 3rd

Took the bike to the other shop, told them the story. Let them decide to replace the broken spoke or them all.

They decided to replace just the broken spoke with a DT spoke (what ever that means). They also trued the wheel, which had gotten a slight ""eggy"" shape.

My fingers are crossed that this wheel will last now.

Once again, thank you all for your input!

Anecdotal Update

In case anyone follows... Since the last repair at the other shop, the wheel kept being in good shape. Finally, my spokes stayed tensioned, wheels stiff and true - the long struggle was finally over. Alas, the joy didn't even last a month...

Going home from a company party, I returned to my bike I parked at the train station, only to find out that some punk kids had apparently tossed it to the ground, and jumped both wheels badly out of shape. Front wheel had to be replaced and back wheel was in desperate need for a trueing. sigh

Sorry for the melodrama, just thought I'd update you the faith of my bike ;-).
",abstrask,https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/users/3123,"If the wheel keeps on failing - for some unidentified reason - you have to review the variables: 
  - the rim 
  - the hub 
  - the spokes
  - the construction 

From your description it's probably not the rim and, like @Daniel says, 'burrs on the hub' sounds like some fake techno-jargon you're being fobbed off with. 

It certainly sounds like the spokes are failing to do the job the wheel builder is expecting of them. I'm a similar size and when I had some wheels made recently the builder used tandem spokes for their extra strength. Every little helps. 

That said, it sounds like, unless you've a particular reason to keep with them, finding another shop might keep you safe and sane - and a second opinion is rarely a bad thing in this sort of situation.

From your description it's probably not the rim and, like @Daniel says, 'burrs on the hub' sounds like some fake techno-jargon you're being fobbed off with. 

It certainly sounds like the spokes are failing to do the job the wheel builder is expecting of them. I'm a similar size and when I had some wheels made recently the builder used tandem spokes for their extra strength. Every little helps. 

That said, it sounds like, unless you've a particular reason to keep with them, finding another shop might keep you safe and sane - and a second opinion is rarely a bad thing in this sort of situation.

",ysap,https://photo.stackexchange.com/users/1024,"I just got extension tubes, so here's the skinny.


  ...what am I losing when using tubes...?


A very considerable amount of light!  Increasing that distance from the end of the lens to the sensor can cut your light several stops.  Combined with the fact that you'll usually shoot stopped down - expect to need to increase your ISO considerably.

The fact the macro's are usually considered very very sharp, although I believe that 70-200mm 2.8 is supposed to be quite sharp.

The ultra low distortion typical of many macros.

I wouldn't worry too much about the bokeh since the DOF will still be quite limited.

Coupled on my 50mm, a full 60mm'ish extension tube results in a DOF of about a couple inches in front of the lens.  On my 70-300, its probably around 2-3 feet in front of the lens to about a foot in front of the lens.

",pnp,https://security.stackexchange.com/users/9778,"That your browser crosses out the https and turns it red, is because the server could not be verified. You might be talking to an attacker's server as well as your own because you don't have a trusted certificate.

However, that the server is not verified does not mean it doesn't encrypt the connection. All traffic is still encrypted, only the browser can't make sure the ""password"" sent to him by the server (a.k.a. the ""public key"") was really from your server. When you try to use https and the browser can't setup an encrypted channel, it would simply have rejected connecting, giving you one of the errors @ewanm89 mentioned.

5612,5612,8904,Why use a small aperture when trying to see sensor dust?,"Here and there I read of people who set their lens to a small aperture while testing their sensor cleanness, supposedly to get the best image of dust speckles. However, the image of the on-sensor dust particles should not, to my understanding, be affected by the sharpness induced by the lens settings. Same is true for dust particle on the lens elements themselves. It makes me wonder - do these people misunderstand the theory of how the optical system work, or am I missing something?
",ysap,https://photo.stackexchange.com/users/1024,"If I understand your question correctly, stopping the aperture down to its narrowest ensures that light is focused as tightly as possible. If you take a photograph at a wider aperture, excess non-incident light will still make it to the sensor, and mitigate the effects of sensor dust.

To put that in more precise technical terms...with a narrow aperture, the light that strikes the sensor is from as narrow a field as possible, and as close to perpendicular as possible (90° to sensor plane). That causes dust particles to create a ""sharp shadow"" on the sensor. At a wider aperture, the light that strikes the sensor is from a wide field of view, and light may not always be perpendicular (could be anywhere from 90° to say 70°), since the entire lens surface plays a role in focusing light. Those off-axis rays of light cause dust particles to create a ""soft shadow"" on the sensor.



You could demonstrate the effect at a macro scale, if you need a visual exemplar. Hold your hand up a foot or two from your wall, and point a bright but narrow beam of light at it...say from a flashlight about 10 feet away. The shadow from your hand should be clear and sharp. Perform the same experiment again, however this time, set up several shaded lamps that emit light in a broad field in a line parallel to the wall about 10 feet away.

5742,5742,9091,What is the cardinality of the family of unlabelled bipartite graphs on n vertices?,"I have attempted to calculate the number of unlabelled bipartite graphs as follows:


  Let $G = (V_1, V_2, E)$ be a bipartite graph on $n$ vertices with $|V_1| = m$ and $|V_2| = n-m$. Assume without loss of generality that $|V_1| \leq |V_2|$ so $m \leq \left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor$. If $G$ is complete bipartite then it has $m(n-m)$ edges since each of the vertices in $V_1$ is connected to each in $V_2$. Thus, the total number of bipartite graphs with parts of size $m$ and $n-m$ is $2^{m(n-m)}$. In order to find the total number of possible bipartite graphs on $n$ vertices we sum over all possible $m$:
  \begin{align}
\sum^{\left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor}_{m=1} 2^{m(n-m)}

3182,3182,5070,"Which is the older sense of the word ""linguist""?","I have been listening to some rants on YouTube against people learning a bunch of languages calling themselves ""linguists"".

I'm personally interested in both linguistics and languages as a hobby but I have no official training and certainly no qualifications in either.

My instinct was that the ranter was kind of right in his opinion that people who speak many languages are not linguists. But I was uncomfortable with his opinion that you had to have certain pieces of paper to be called a linguist, I think ""post doctorate"" from memory.

So I looked up ""linguist"" in some imperfect online dictionaries and was surprised to find both senses. Here's the defs from oxforddictionaries.com (chosen at random):


  
  A person skilled in foreign languages.
  A person who studies linguistics.
  


Now I don't have access to a better dictionary on historical principles from my current location.

I would like to know which of these senses is the original one?

My original opinion was the latter sense but on thinking about it I now expect it to be the former. I doubt the word would be a back-formation from ""linguistics"".

As a side question, would the first sense now be considered to be colloquial or at least nontechnical or outdated?

2395,2395,3824,"Are DSLRs a dying breed, making now the time to switch to a mirrorless camera system?","I came across this thought provoking article on Stuck in Customs today that makes a strong case to hold off too much investment in DSLR gear, and instead switch to mirror-less cameras like the Sony NEX. The author prefers to call such cameras 3rd generation cameras to prevent any bias.

The crux of the argument lies in the smaller size and faster shooting speeds of the new cameras, while the sensor size is an area where they seem to be lacking (Sony &amp; Samsung cameras are APS-C sized though). Currently the big makers - Nikon &amp; Canon - have practically no presence in this market (Nikon seems to be doing something with the V1). However, they seem to have slowed down the introduction of new entry level DSLR models over the last year as well.

So, as DSLR users looking to build and enhance their kit (there are many like me who've jumped the bandwagon over the last couple of years, and are just starting to build their kit), what are the advantages of sticking with the DSLR system rather than switching to the 3rd gen cameras?

IMO, one point that could cause a massive switch in the DSLR base would be if Nikon &amp; Canon announced mirror-less models compatible with their current lens lineups, but that is a hypothetical scenario.

P.S. There is a similar question on mirror-less cameras, but that seems to be from the perspective of a person starting out rather than a person already invested in the DSLR system.

Look at cameras by Hasselblad, Leica, and Mamiya.  You can see both formats larger than ""full frame"" and lens mounts that don't need to make room for a mirror.  They have their advantages, too.

I think a new format will eventually emerge that does not exist today.  It will be larger than the 4/3rds system because of the advantages of a larger sensor regarding noise.

5753,5753,9112,Who should pursue a Ph.D degree?,"I am asking myself the question ""Should I do PhD or should I leave academia and go for an industrial career?""

My life-goal is being a professor. And I love to do research. 

PhD is surely a bite that not everyone can chew.
But I wonder who can chew it?

I never was good at tests and exams. My BSc. GPA was 2.84/4.00 but finished my MSc. with 3.50/4.00

However, currently I am working on a conference paper and I feel like even that is too much for me. It has been nearly 3 months and still, the paper draft is to be improved (not the wording but the content).

I am surely a hard-worker but not always. Sometimes, I let go of my work and absorbed in other stuff (composing, amateur radio etc). If this period is too wide, I have to spend double effort to warm-up and remember where I left.

I don't know how things work in PhD. It usually is 5-6 years. It is the one of two most-challenging milestones in academic career (the other is getting the title Assoc. Prof).
Should I completely be a ""nerd"" and work on my thesis systematically (something I could never make in my entire life) or working periodically but with extra effort is still sufficient?

So, here's my question: If I say ""I'm considering to do PhD"" and ask your advice, what would you ask me? What kind of skills/characteristics do you look for a potential academician?

I know it is way too late for me to ask this kind of question, as a person who almost finished his master's degree. But better lose the saddle than the horse.

This is the number one reason to get into grad school. However, it's not clear at this point that you have an accurate idea of what it means, on a daily basis, to work in research.

Sure there are fun times fiddling with the knobs of expensive equipment, drawing equations on napkins until late in the night, traveling to exotic conference locations like Baltimore, etc. There are also these brief moments when you feel like an undergrad actually learned something from you, and those where you share inside jokes that you can tell for sure only your advisor and yourself can understand. I recall a quote from a senior researcher in my field saying ""Can you believe that they pay us to do what we love?"".

But there are other aspects that are less glamorous. Administrative work, data bookkeeping, actual bookkeeping, wondering what you will do with your life, filing grant applications, etc. There is the anguish about funding, the frustration of aborted projects, the time and energy wasted in dealing with department politics.

I don't know what GPA is, nor how to interpret your grade, but the context tells me that you think they could be better. Passing exams and conducting research are different jobs, not being excellent at one does not mean you can't be good at the second one (a) although it often helps; b) the reverse is also true). It will make things harder for you when applying to grad school, but after that it becomes irrelevant. What matters more is what you actually learned, some people have ok grades but understood a great deal of the concepts.

3214,3214,5126,Piezo as a switch to flash an led when disturbed,"An LED embedded in a small translucent item (say half the size of a pack of cards) that would flash on briefly if the object was disturbed or tipped over.
I immediately responded that a piezoelectric sensor/generator inside the object wired to an LED would do it.
However, when I tried to demonstrate this concept using a piezo buzzer I liberated from an old phone, I could only get the LED to register a dim blip when I smashed the piezo buzzer with a blunt object.
How would I ensure that a piezo sensor/generator would actually light up the LED adequately without the application of blunt force trauma.
As I mentioned, space would be an issue so no large parts, breadboards, or really complex circuitry.
I'm just trying to figure out the easiest and smallest way to accomplish this simple task.

Why is it disrespectful?  Does everyone agree with this?  What about using ""Amonai"" (""my Ammonites""?), as is done in the movie Ushpizin?  I understand why it was done there (had to sound close to the real thing), but I've since heard a choir use it too.

So, he talks about the fugues, sonatas and partitas, modulation, themes played against themselves, how Bach manages to get two or more musical lines going simultaneously and so on.

But I don't understand a thing about these musical concepts. I have tried to listen on YouTube to some of the compositions he mentions in the book, but my stupid brain only hears a stream of notes flowing. I can't recognize the patterns he talks about, nor can I grasp, for example, the fact the the ""Canon per Tonos"" rises successively until it reaches the key C again. 

So how can I learn more about these musical concepts, so as to better follow the book's main ideas?

1299,1299,2046,How to set precision and format labeled Slider in Manipulate?,"For my calculations, I need increased precision of parameter 'k' in my Manipulate:

  SetPrecision[0.100, 22], Appearance -&gt; ""Labeled""}]


However, at the same time, for aesthetic reasons, I want the label to the right of the slider to display only couple of digits.

How this could be done?
",Cendo,https://mathematica.stackexchange.com/users/1290,"Two, now three, ways:  I think I'd recommend the first -- strike that -- maybe the third one at the end, but perhaps you have a reason for using SetPrecision, in which case, use the second.

Manipulate[
 Plot[Cos[k x], {x, 0, 2 Pi}],
 {{k, 1}, 0.`22, 4.`22, 0.1`22, Appearance -&gt; ""Labeled""}]


The second way is to make your own label.  Here editing the label still maintains the desired precision.

Manipulate[
 Plot[Cos[k x], {x, 0, 2 Pi}],
 {{k, 1}, SetPrecision[0., 22], SetPrecision[4.0, 22], SetPrecision[0.100, 22],

      Appearance -&gt; ""Frameless"", BaseStyle -&gt; ""Label""]}] &amp;}
 ]


Here is a variation with a non-editable label:

Manipulate[
 Plot[Cos[k x], {x, 0, 2 Pi}],
 {{k, 1}, SetPrecision[0., 22], SetPrecision[4.0, 22], SetPrecision[0.100, 22],
  Row[{Manipulator[##], ""  "", Dynamic@Round[k, 0.1]}] &amp;}]


Both look the same.





There is a difference between setting the precision with SetPrecision and with a backtick:

x = SetPrecision[0.1, 22]
(* 0.1000000000000000055511 *)

y = 0.1`22
(* 0.1000000000000000000000 *)

Precision /@ {x, y}
(* {22., 22.} *)

x - y
(* 5.5511*10^-18 *)




Alternatively, you can use a dummy variable and convert it to the desired precision:

Manipulate[
 k = N[Round[k0, 1/10], 22];
 Plot[Cos[k x], {x, 0, 2 Pi}, PlotLabel -&gt; k],
 {{k0, 1, ""k""}, 0, 4, 0.1, Appearance -&gt; ""Labeled""},

 Plot[Cos[k x], {x, 0, 2 Pi}],
 {{k, 1}, 0.`22, 4.`22, 0.1`22, Appearance -&gt; ""Labeled""}]


The second way is to make your own label.  Here editing the label still maintains the desired precision.

Manipulate[
 Plot[Cos[k x], {x, 0, 2 Pi}],
 {{k, 1}, SetPrecision[0., 22], SetPrecision[4.0, 22], SetPrecision[0.100, 22], 
  Row[{Manipulator[##], ""  "", 
     InputField[Dynamic[Round[k, 0.1], (k = SetPrecision[#, 22]) &amp;], 
      Appearance -&gt; ""Frameless"", BaseStyle -&gt; ""Label""]}] &amp;}
 ]


Here is a variation with a non-editable label:

Manipulate[
 Plot[Cos[k x], {x, 0, 2 Pi}],
 {{k, 1}, SetPrecision[0., 22], SetPrecision[4.0, 22], SetPrecision[0.100, 22],
  Row[{Manipulator[##], ""  "", Dynamic@Round[k, 0.1]}] &amp;}]


Both look the same.





There is a difference between setting the precision with SetPrecision and with a backtick:

x = SetPrecision[0.1, 22]
(* 0.1000000000000000055511 *)

y = 0.1`22
(* 0.1000000000000000000000 *)

Precision /@ {x, y}
(* {22., 22.} *)

x - y
(* 5.5511*10^-18 *)




Alternatively, you can use a dummy variable and convert it to the desired precision:

Manipulate[
 k = N[Round[k0, 1/10], 22];
 Plot[Cos[k x], {x, 0, 2 Pi}, PlotLabel -&gt; k],
 {{k0, 1, ""k""}, 0, 4, 0.1, Appearance -&gt; ""Labeled""},
 {k, None},
 TrackedSymbols :&gt; {k0}]


(I included a plot label to verify that k has the proper precision.)

2966,2966,4720,How do I keep drawer knobs from loosening over time?,"I see knobs like this on cabinets, dressers, and closet doors. They are held in place with a single wood screw.


Very often they are loose. I guess when we grab them we often impart a slight twist. Also, temperature and humidity changes cause the wood to swell and shrink. The system is biased towards unscrewing, so over time they loosen up.

My DIY instinct says that this is bad. That the screw will strip out the knob, or it will ream out the hole in the door. Well, it seems sloppy.

When I notice one, I give it a twist to tighten. Sometimes I put my finger over the screw head to hold it still. When it's really stiff, I might get out the multitool. Sometimes, in my enthusiasm, I strip out the knob. Doh!

What's the best way to deal with these things? For example:


Use handles that take two screws.
Put a washer under the head to distribute the load, then make them really tight.
Keep them all tight according to a schedule.
Only use knobs made of strong wood, and keep them tight.
Use knobs that take a machine screw instead of a wood screw.
Put wood glue in the screw hole.
Use door designs that don't need a handle.

1587,1587,2501,Why don't banks give access to all your transaction activity?,"In the era of big data, I find it surprising that banks and credit card companies only offer access to a ridiculously small number of transactions - often only your last 180 days, if that. The longest I've seen was 720 days going back. I suspect they do store everything, but intentionally limit access.

These transactions are text only, take up extremely little space, and storing an individual's lifetime worth of transaction would take less than 10MB of data; about the storage required by two MP3 files, and about 250k records per person per lifetime, if we generously assume everyone makes 10 transactions a day. But I'd be happy with only the last 10 years of transactions, so about 1MB per customer. One of the largest banks, JP Morgan Chase, has ~70MM credit card customers. That means 70TB of data for 10 years of records - hardly impressive for a corporation of that size, with $17B of net income in 2013, when 1TB of cloud storage costs $10 retail per month.

By comparison, would you put up with Gmail or any online email provider keeping only the most recent 120 days worth of email? (And emails do take a lot more space than transactions, are far more numerous, and have to be instantly retrievable.)

Storage requirements for transaction activity are trivial in an era where we're throwing around petabytes and zetabytes.

Is there a sound reason for banks not offering access to all your transactions, other than legacy software on their side?

",beNerd,https://stackoverflow.com/users/1490278,"You need to tell your controller that the value of the tab has changed and then update it with the new value from the service. The second controller (ContentSwitcher) can not know, that the value changed and you simply assigned the string value of getTab once to this.tab.

5847,5847,9265,Identify my Motobécane racing bike,"I bought a Motobécane last year (pics below), and now that the bottom bracket is broken, I really need to know the model of the bike, to help me change that piece.

It would also be helpful if someone could redirect me to the Motobécane catalogs of the years 82, 83, I can't find them, and I suspect my bike is from this period.

Technical specifications:


frame color: green and black (How customizable was that? I think they didn't sell the same colors each year)
frame: tubing inexternal 707, ""trainer"" (I don't find the appropriate info about it)
brakes: Weinmann
derailleur: Sachs - Huret. 12 gears
Wheel: Maillard
Bottom Crank: ?? width of the shell: 74mm. From this page http://sheldonbrown.com/vrbn-g-n.html, the old french ones have special dimensions. Also on Motobécane, they are swiss type (left-threaded). I don't know if this is a cotterless one, shimano octalink, or if I can put something more standard?


[EDIT: As suggested by @Blam, I took the bottom bracket out.
First mistake: shell width doesn't correspond to the red line on the pic, but less, so width should be 68mm, I'll double check on the bike.
The Brand is Stronglight, french brand, but the threading is the normal one (left-threaded on the right side, and right-threaded on the left side).
The axle is 120mm long, tapered square. Like this model: http://www.ebay.com/itm/VP-Components-Bottom-Bracket-120mm-Square-Taper-Unsealed-Bike-NEW-/311359596201?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&amp;hash=item487e7a66a9

But anyway, I'm still interested in knowing the model of this bike, and/or finding the Motobécane catalogues of years 1982-83]

Important Note: The rear wheel is not the original (was broken). I also changed the part of the crank where I put the feet when I bought it (maybe I shouldn't have...). 

Sorry if it looks quite dirty, I didn't have time to clean.

",PlasmaBinturong,https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/users/19414,"Turbulent times for Motobecane.

You can find the (last that I have found) French Motobecane for 1985-6 (dated Sept. 85) on forum.tontonvelo.com  (with the French model designations).

However, no Trainer in them and there are not many models listed - MBK/Motobecane was producing many other models many with older tube types from the past (decals similar to Peugoet - later with red/orange/yellow colors) during 85-6. The Motobecane name appears to have been dropped late 1986 the same year Yamaha became the main shareholder. 

I suspect your Trainer is one of the earlier ones possibly late 85/early 86, the later ""Trainers"" I've seen have either a ""Reseau Motobecane"" badge on the steerer tube or ""MBK Motobecane"" on the down tube. If you check the components and the serial numbers with data on the web, you should be able to get a good idea. I stumbled on a few sources out there on the Motobecane/MBK Trainer when searching for info on another bike of that period.

Recently got caught up into this period as well due to a Motobecane ""Ranger"" (no MBK on the frame) from the same period, picked it up for the missing Espace bars on a 1984 Mt. Becane. Oddly and apprently the MBK label had already been used for the ""Mt. Becane"" in 85 (MBK model=Ranger) with the same specs as the '84 Motobecane (with the platform tandem fork and Espace handlebars through 86), the same time Motobecane Ranger was made with a different frame and unicorn fork. The later 1987 MBK Ranger model looks the same as the earlier Motobecane Ranger including the unicrown fork. All very odd.

Hope this helps and good luck!

5889,5889,9330,What are the implications of Emmet's autonomous movement?,"During The Lego Movie we learn that the whole LEGO world is actually a universe existing within ours, or to be precise, in the basement of a real human family and that the whole story is actually played out by a little boy named Finn and a way for him to cope with the conflict of his strict and fantasy-inhibiting father. And indeed this is again strengthened when we see that the actions as performed by his father when supposedly ""repairing the mess"" that Finn created are directly represented by Lord Business' micromanagers performing them inside the in-universe viewpoint of the other LEGO figures.

Upto this point that is a reasonable and obvious representation to me and even Emmet's direct witness of the universe behind his, our real world, is nothing but him seeing the strips behind the course of his own universe, however he managed to overcome this boundary between dimensions. But the single-most action that completely shatters this whole viewpoint is the incident, when Emmet manages to move completely on his own, thus directly interfering with our universe on his own and it seems to me that there is no way to bring this in congruence to our own physical reality, not even when accepting the LEGO world and its course as an emanation of Finn's fantasy, since Finn didn't do anything at all.

So what are we to make of this incident? Does it have any deeper implications for the depicted realities? Does this establish the LEGO figures as existent and sentient within our physical reality outside of our mere fantasy? Does it have any further signficance for the meaning of the whole story and actually extend the rather simple and obvious kid's fantasy interpretation of the story in a much more elaborate way I have missed?

3265,3265,5203,Preventing Superscript from being interpreted as Power when using Ctrl+^ shortcut?,"I have very strong desire to use superscript as the index of the variable.

However, it looks like that the Mathematica automatically recognize the superscript as the power and I got message that my variable with superscript is 'protected'.

Could you help me to make the superscript used as the index of the variable instead of power?

This question is being reopened and a bounty is being awarded on this. Previous answers are very good, however the bounty is to be awarded on an answer which solve this specific problem: 


  How to change the behaviour of Ctrl+^ keybinding so that it produces Superscript instead of Power.

",Donggyu Jang,https://mathematica.stackexchange.com/users/9887,"Superscript is not interpreted as Power:



Presumably you are referring to what happens when you enter a power in superscript notation using the key combination Ctrl+6.  Mathematica is capable of representing both this power notation and a formatted plain Superscript.  In my opinion it is a failing that the power notation appears in the Typesetting menu while the latter is missing; if anything it should be the other way around I think.  Since there is no key combination for raw Superscript I propose using a palette or input alias:

Palette

You may enter a formatting template using a palette button which may be created with:

CreatePalette @ PasteButton @ Superscript[\[SelectionPlaceholder], \[Placeholder]]




Click that palette button to insert a template for plain superscript in the current Notebook.  Use Tab to move between fields.

Input alias

Either open the Option Inspector, select Global Preferences, type ""InputAliases"" to find the appropriate entry, and add this to the list of rules:

""sps"" -&gt; TemplateBox[{""\[SelectionPlaceholder]"", ""\[Placeholder]""}, ""Superscript""]


Or add it programmatically (run this only once):

AppendTo[
 CurrentValue[$FrontEnd, ""InputAliases""],
 ""sps"" -&gt; TemplateBox[{""\[SelectionPlaceholder]"", ""\[Placeholder]""}, ""Superscript""]
]


Now type: EscspsEsc to enter a template for plain Superscript.

  [A] solution to map the Ctrl+^ keybinding to produce superscript instead of power.


To accomplish this first copy MenuSetup.tr from the installation directory to the matching path in your user directory and open the user copy for editing:

os = $OperatingSystem /. ""Unix"" -&gt; ""X"";

CopyFile @@ (
  FileNameJoin[{#, ""SystemFiles"", ""FrontEnd"", ""TextResources"", os, ""MenuSetup.tr""}] &amp; /@
    {$InstallationDirectory, $UserBaseDirectory})

Then within the user copy edit the appropriate MenuItem to read:

MenuItem[""&amp;Superscript"", 
 FrontEndExecute[{
   FrontEnd`SelectionMove[FrontEnd`InputNotebook[], All, Word], 
   FrontEnd`NotebookApply[FrontEnd`InputNotebook[], 
    TemplateBox[{""\[SelectionPlaceholder]"", ""\[Placeholder]""}, ""Superscript""], 
    Placeholder]
 }],
 MenuKey[""6"", Modifiers -&gt; {""Control""}]

Restart Mathematica.

You may now enter raw Superscript by using Ctrl+6 where 6 is the number-line six above the alphabetic keyboard.

You can still enter Power notation by using Ctrl+Shift+6 or Ctrl+Keypad-6, the latter assuming that Num Lock is on.



For those you prefer the reverse behavior you can instead copy and edit KeyEventTranslations.tr and change the Item:

Item[KeyEvent[""^"", Modifiers -&gt; {Control}], ""Superscript""]

6022,6022,9556,Proving square root of a square is the same as absolute value,"Lets say I have a function defined as $f(x) = \sqrt {x^2}$. Common knowledge of square roots tells you to simplify to $f(x) = x$ (we'll call that $g(x)$) which may be the same problem, but it isn't the same equation. For example, say I put $-1$ into them:

$\begin{align}
f(x) &amp;= \sqrt {x^2} \\
f(-1) &amp;= \sqrt {(-1)^2} \\
f(-1) &amp;= \sqrt {1} \\
f(-1) &amp;= 1
\end{align}$

$\begin{align}
g(x) &amp;= x \\
g(-1) &amp;= -1
\end{align}$

thereby, we conclude that $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ do not produce the same results even though they are mathematically the same. This is also shown when we try to graph the functions:

$y = \sqrt {x^2}$:



$y = x$:



$y = \mid x \mid$:



From this, we can see that given $f(x) = \sqrt {x^2}$, when simplified is not the same as $f(x) = x$. So, is there any way to prove that $y = \sqrt {x^2}$ is not the same as $y = x$ for negative values, but is infact the same as $y = \mid x \mid$?

5635,5635,8933,How do you deal with amends from a client?,"I'm a web designer currently working with a very demanding client.

I presented them with designs back in May and I'm still working through amends with them. They are making changes to everything and although I know amends are to be expected, it's really getting to be frustrating. I'm currently working every evening on the list of new amends they have. Tiny things like ""make this blue"" or ""change the width of this"" or ""make this gap smaller"".

I know amends need to be made and that's fine, but how do you handle when there are just too many? I've counted the comments on inVision and there have been 185 amends on 6 pages of a website design. 

Some of them change, and then change again, and then change again and again. For example they wanted to add a strapline, so I added it, adjusted all the menus to accomodate is across the 6 pages. Then they wanted to change the text, so I changed it and updated it across all 6 documents. Now that it's changed, they want to make the menu smaller so now I have to go back and change the menu again.

I quoted based on time I thought it would take to complete the designs with some time for amends but I've more than tripled the time. I haven't explained to them early enough in the process that amends beyond the normal would cost them more so I'm going to have to swallow the cost this time, but should I lay this out better with future clients?

How do you handle amends? Do you put an estimated time on them at the beginning, and then charge more if they go over this? Or do you do something different?

http://freelancing.stackexchange.com/questions/3226/project-based-freelance-project-requiring-multiple-unexpected-redos-from-clien/3337#3337.

I like to ask a lot of questions before getting started, prepare quick sketches, and split my projects in ""steps""; and then each step gets approved. Once a client goes back, it's a revision that is charged.

I also explain to clients they have to provide their final texts and the images they want to use to avoid revisions.

Always be specific and yes, explain clearly the process before you get started.



But since you're already stuck with this...

When clients are back to using the html site as a ""sketch zone"" as your client does, stop changing the CSS and the html, and go back to using a plan or showing them a JPG of ONE page (or sections of it). Explain them that when you start doing CSS and html, it's not the time to play around and modify things (at least not menus and big changes.) You can be nice and tell them it's for their own good since the coding requires some planning and it avoids mistakes. Don't tell stuff like ""it's easy"", they might end up believing it's truly easy for you.

So take a screenshot of a main page, do the changes in Photoshop or Illustrator or Indesign, and show them a JPG ""proof"" that they will approve. Have the main layout approved first, not all 6 pages!

On your proof, add a mention about ""any changes after this is approved will be charged at XX/hour"". And instead of sending that proof by email, host it somewhere and send them an url; this way it will appear at 100% in their browser and they'll have a better idea of what to expect. 

Personally, I like to present them 2-4 options; this way they can say they like the menu of A, the body font of B and the footer of C for example. Then I present them another set of proofs with the elements they preferred, and other options if necessary. Usually it ends up limiting the possible requests they might have because you showed them pretty much everything possible at this point! Your proofs don't need to be perfect, they're like a sketch; just do some copy/paste and move things around.

Once it's approved, you can go back to coding. If you have to come back again to ""sketching"" or modify your code, start charging at hourly rate. 

You need to do something like this otherwise they'll keep going until december 2016 if they get all that free work from you and if you don't require them to fully approve some of your work. Right now, they're not taking any decision.



PS: I don't like using design software to do sketches of the websites, and I'm sure you don't either. It's way simpler sometimes to do it straight in CSS but... the reason why you're doing this is not so much to make it faster to do the website but to make your client feel like you're also making them go back to step 1! All they want in the end is to have their website done; when you go back to showing them JPGs, they get a bit less excited and you get back some control on the situation. 

They will approve your JPGs proofs faster than the real website you're showing them because they will want to see the result ""live"" as soon as possible.

The Roomba has an SCI port to allow for control of the roomba via serial. I installed the PySerial library on the pi and send valid commands to Roomba, but the roomba doesn't respond. I have the TXD of the cable attached to the TXD of the roomba, the RXD on the cable wired to the RXD on the roomba, and a ground on the cable wired to the ground on the roomba (everything in  it's respective port). I do not have power going from the cable to the roomba or vice-versa.

What I can't figure out is why the commands aren't working. There's no error message upon running the python code. This is the information sheet for the Roomba's SCI port.

Code:

ser.baudrate = 57600

1625,1625,2548,Why does my 24VDC fan draw much less current than labeled?,"I have three Delta PFB0824UHE, which were provided to me by a customer for a project. They are labeled 0.93A.



When actually hooked up to 24V, the fan draws .45A, regardless of head pressure. This current varies linearly with input voltage, going as low as .2A and as high as .5A across the fan's spec'd input voltage range. I have three units, which all behave the same. 

The datasheets I find for this part indicate a current draw of 0.77A.

I’m confused as to how much current I should actually expect this fan to draw. Do fan manufacturers typically allow that much overhead in their specs? Are they subject to manufacturing variations to that degree? Do I perhaps have some special variant of the fan, and not know it? Are they perhaps mislabeled? Should I expect the fan's current draw to increase over time, or with temperature or some other variable?

4807,4807,7637,Can std::unique_ptr be used as an argument?,"Now, I'm just studying about smart_ptr (unique_ptr / shared_ptr). And I wrote test code like this for checking unique_ptr can be used as argument.

printf(""T1 = [%02x]\n"", pTest-&gt;cT1);
printf(""T2 = [%02x]\n"", pTest-&gt;cT2);

And then, I added one function using unique_ptr as parameter like this.

    printf(""T1 in TestPrint Func = [%02x]\n"", p_pData-&gt;cT1);

In this case, I can't pass the pTest. Why not? I think pTest is std::unique_ptr and p_pData is std::unique_ptr in TestPrint function. So it's the same type!! But I can't. I want to know why it doesn't work.

Of course, it can work after changing the function to std::unique_ptr&lt;T_TEST&gt;&amp; p_pData. But I don't understand why I can't pass the parameter despite of same data type.

Pointer is bad at resource management, but good at access resource, if you do not need to pass the ownership to the function, you can use pointer to replace unique_ptr, this is more flexible IMHO, because the raw pointer can work with shared_ptr, unique_ptr, weal_ptr and other smart pointer, but unique_ptr must work with unique_ptr only.

Is there a way to keep the the input even if the page is closed? If not would it be better to set up a list as a Data Source? Is the something I could do in C# to keep the values?

This is a temporary solution until a database is set up then the values will come from there. However its going to take some time to set that up. Also as of now all my code is HTML and CSS. Any help or ideas are very much appreciated and thank you in advanced!!!

Notice that you need to compile twice.


  Explanation


Inside the tikzset there is the definition of the style of the picture to be drawn (remember picture with id) then the definition and the writing on the the .aux of the id and position of the mark. Anyway, to get a better explanation, you can refer to http://tex.stackexchange.com/a/50054/13304. Finally, the commands that you need to use inside your document, \tikzmarkin and \tikzmarkend are defined. 


  EDIT: insertion of the annotation


For this purpose I adopted the same trick of Mark a pseudocode block and insert comments near it: the insertion of an anchor inside the \tikzmarkin macro to subsequently used it as reference to insert the annotation. What changes in the previous MWE? 

In the preamble you should add:

\usetikzlibrary{calc} % &lt;= needed for some computations

\usepackage{lipsum} % &lt;= needed to insert some text later


The \tikzmarkin should be improved as:

\newcommand{\tikzmarkin}[1]{%
      \tikz[remember picture with id=#1]
      \draw[line width=1pt,rectangle,rounded corners,fill=\fillcol]
      (pic cs:#1) ++(0.065,-0.15) rectangle (-0.05,0.32) node [anchor=base] (#1){}
      ;}


where the relevant new part is just node [anchor=base] (#1){}. 

Finally, the document:

\begin{document}
    \begin{equation*}
    \left.\begin{array}{cc}
      -2\cdot \tikzmarkin{a}\red{2}=&amp; -4 \\
      -2\cdot \red{1}=&amp; -2 \\
      -2\cdot \red{0}\tikzmarkend{a}=&amp; 0
    \end{array}\right\} \text{\small Product increases by 2 each time.}
    \end{equation*}

    % To insert the annotation
    \begin{tikzpicture}[remember picture,overlay]
        \coordinate (aa) at ($(a)+(1.825,-1.65)$); % &lt;= adjust this parameter to move the position of the annotation 
        \node[align=left,right] at (aa) {\small{Annotation}};
        \path[-latex,red,draw] (aa) -| ($(a)+(0.15,-1.3)$);
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \linebreak

    \lipsum[1]

\end{document}


The last part is the one needed to insert the annotation: first I defined a coordinate where to insert it based on the anchor previously saved (to accomplish this, it is important that the tikzpicture has as options remember picture,overlay). The last command:

\path[-latex,red,draw] (aa) -| ($(a)+(0.15,-1.3)$);


draws the arrow: the starting point is the coordinate of the annotation and the final point should be computed knowing that the reference anchor a is placed on the top left of the red rectangle.

This will lead to:



One final remark: I think should be better to insert a \linebreak after the tikzpicture to avoid that the annotation will be placed too nearly the subsequent text.

I even tried to reinstall Chrome but as soon as I resync, the problem is back!
Search predictions are just gone without option to fix!!

In IE changing the search provider allows specifying a prediction (suggestion) provider, In chrome, once you change the default search engine, you'll never be able to have predictions again!!
This is a terrible bug, I mean WTF!!!

Is there any workaround to that?

I posted a bug report a while ago but it seems no one looks at it. I'm about to give up on Chrome and go back to IE, the only good thing about Chrome is the Extension market and the AdBlocker (which I can find in IE as well). The perfrormance changes don't matter to me too much.

5640,5640,8942,What are the benefits of owning a physical book?,"I have seen this question about updates of the D&amp;D 4th Edition books, and it got me thinking.
Since I got my Kindle I have not read a single paper novel; they have fewer drawbacks compared to digital copies than rpg rulebooks.


Dead-tree types have some benefits like looking good on a bookshelf, but any ebook reader weighs less with 100 novels than the usual hard-cover book. 
If you want to look for the damage of Ares Alpha, even with a half-decent tablet it takes less than 2 seconds.  
Digital copies do not get worn, they never get unwanted earmarks, but you can bookmark them.
Rulebooks do get updates, and unless you are willing to take a pen to your book, your hard copies will never contain them. The pdfs can be edited and resent to the buyers. 
Even better is the WotC approach with the DDI, you can look up any monster or item or (almost any) rule, in the most recent form, for 3 years at the cost of seven books. 


I think this is the way to go, even considering the horribly slow character builder. Although I must admit good illustration can help build the athmosphere.

So what am I missing? Why are people buying rpg rulebooks in paper format? Why are books even published, I do not need to know if feats are supposed to be on the right page and skills on the left, I just want a list of them, filterable any way I want. 

Is this just a necessary part of earning money? I understand that pdfs are copied illegally, but the Compendium is not. 
",András,https://rpg.stackexchange.com/users/9552,"This easily reads as a matter of preference to me over anything.  From a subjective standpoint I simply enjoy the smell of ink and paper and the feel of pages but from there... It's anyone's race really.

E-Books


Portability: The only reason I bring a laptop or e-reader to games is usually because the game is when I'm playing at the home of someone else or a neutral location of some sort.  Call me lazy, but I'm less than enthused to carry my entire collection which with my AD&amp;D stuff, is easily a dozen each hardback and soft cover books.  Having digital copies saves me some potentially considerable effort to keep everything I need with me.  Every game I have been a part of for any serious duration usually has several books and everyone needs only one or two pages from the extras but the whole book has to come along.
Indexing:  There are precious few books that have a pervasive index.  Some are simply maddening because they will place an entry as a subsection of another instead of being its own listing.  Searchable text has been a life saving feature that helps me even facilitate answers for this site because I can keep jabbing the ""find next"" button to make sure there isn't some hidden passage of errata in a different section of the book.  I can go directly to what I want.  Not only this, but I have a dyslexic player who uses the e-book to read aloud to him and that's the only way he learns the rules without a walkthrough mid-game.
Errata: Some releases are digital only nowadays.  Books can always be scanned for free, but new digital content costs to be printed (even if minutely... at first) and having a file is a resource that can be given back.  Unless you choose to print on both sides (or use the back of an already printed page) that page is spent.  Maybe line a birdcage with it but that's about it once you're done.


Spined Books


Redundancy:  Murphy is my worst player.  He corrupts files, drops books and readers alike, summons unholy deluges that permeate the stoutest bag as I dart from vehicle to building.  A book can take a fair amount of damage before becoming useless.  Even if it gets wet or torn, the other pages are still viable.  A backup of files is cheap and easy but a backup of devices is frustratingly costly.  Even if one book becomes totally useless, the rest should still be in good condition anyway.
Psychology: I can't agree more with PlasmaHH when it was stated that genuine books imply something about the DM/GM/ST.  They usually mean business unless it's that rich friend who can piddle away money for books like they're tissue boxes.  Every game I've been in where the DM is serious about their world, the content, and grasp of the rules they never subsumed on PDFs alone (although certainly had them where possible).  It's kind of like the illusion a gym membership provides where by virtue of having spent good money on something, you want full value of the resource and hardback books are the most costly.  Other than systems that went out of print before I was aware of them, everything I run I keep at least a core book hard copy for communal use if nothing else.
Distribution: Probably beating a dead horse with many of the answers explaining how using a genuine book means you can give media away without losing the entire medium to read it.  However with some companies being notorious for bad binding, I've seen books split into binder volumes and individual pages given tot he players who need them and right back in the pot when they're done.  No entry cost of time to find the right file, download, change storage device/upload to cloud, download to new device, open, find again for a one time use.  Just give the page back when you're done.
Wear &amp; Tear Can be Your Friend: Believe it or not, the more a book is used, the more useful it gets in my experience.  Several of my books have been opened and creased to specific pages I use so often that with a blind grab at the right depth of the volume I can open to the exact page I want to something I may not have thought to leave a bookmark on (digitally or literally).  Typically any system's combat turn order, the start of its magic and skill sections become permanently held for intuitive indexing.


Equality/Trading Off


Annotation: Familiarity breeds ease of use.  I can place sticky notes or add comments with equal proficiency, as well as remember the page number (within ten pages) or randomly open to it in the book by approximate depth.  These functions are synonymous to me because essentially they work the same by keeping custom information.  In a hard copy you have limited space and might lose a sticky note or tucked index card where in an e-book you might have to guess where the comment trigger is to be found since it collapses.
Multiple Pages: As a subjective factor, being able to separate books and pages to be larger than a screen's resolution can accurately display helps me do the work faster.  However!  Using a laptop for almost all of my digital reading, I have been known to make a second copy of the core book in the folder so I can hold two pages simultaneously open in the same book without creating a conflict.  I have on many occasions held three or four books open and traversed them as easily as my books splayed like scalemail when the situation called for it.
Visibility: For hard copies of books the resolution is almost always perfect.  It matches the size of the viewer (IE the book's physical size) and thus you can always see a full page at the proper reading size.  While the viewing area is often limited on e-readers (I'm rarely displeased with monitors/laptops) the ability to zoom is surprisingly useful, especially for farsighted gamers.  Granted, you can zoom with a mundane magnifying lens on a hard copy as well.  But ultimately both methods fulfill the need equally to me objectively.  I can shrink a window and hold two completely different sources side by side concurrently when not using an e-reader specifically for PDFs.
Space: Being able to keep a library in a device the size of a 9v battery is quite handy... But where did you put that book on it?  Unless you're a database generating fiend such as myself, you probably just have a big mess of books in one spot with no sorting method in place, which when you're looking at a series of identical icons can get tiresome.  Sure hard copies take up space and weight but the visual indexing is powerful as is the mnemonic device of having to sort them as they go on the shelf (if you're even half as compulsive as me when it comes to books) and have at least two senses tied to their shelving - seeing the book slide into space, touching the book (as at least to me different publishers feel different in the slightest ways), maybe even smelling the book as you do.  However, searchable indexing on most devices tends to alleviate this issue which is why it shows up in the ""both"" category instead of as a distinct advantage.

We need the first start tag on 'comment_form_top'. Not later because we have to catch the case of a user who is logged in.
We close that tag and open the second one on 'comment_form_after_fields'.
Finally, we close the last tag after 'comment_form_field_comment'. This one is a filter, not an action.


In the following sample code I throw a style element into the markup. In your theme you should put the CSS into the style sheet. And you should use a clearfix handler of your choice, not the markup I used here. :)

Looking at the default comment form, we can see where their start and end tags should appear. I have added some comments to make that easier to see:

&lt;form action=""&lt;?php echo site_url( '/wp-comments-post.php' ); ?&gt;"" method=""post"" id=""&lt;?php echo esc_attr( $args['id_form'] ); ?&gt;""&gt;

        foreach ( (array) $args['fields'] as $name =&gt; $field ) {
            echo apply_filters( ""comment_form_field_{$name}"", $field ) . ""\n"";
        }

    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;?php do_action( 'comment_form', $post_id ); ?&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;



We need the first start tag on 'comment_form_top'. Not later because we have to catch the case of a user who is logged in.
We close that tag and open the second one on 'comment_form_after_fields'.
Finally, we close the last tag after 'comment_form_field_comment'. This one is a filter, not an action.


In the following sample code I throw a style element into the markup. In your theme you should put the CSS into the style sheet. And you should use a clearfix handler of your choice, not the markup I used here. :)

add_action( 'comment_form_top', 'wpse_67805_open_tag' );

2398,2398,3828,Do parallel realities take precedence over time travel in the Star Trek Universe?,"The 2009 Star Trek movie and its pending sequels are based on the concept of parallel realities introduced in the season 7 Next Generation episode ""Parallels,"" laying out that anything that could happen has happened in a parallel universe. The Enterprise and its crew from the most recent movie are part of a parallel reality that was created when Nero and Spock came back through the black hole created by red matter in an attempt to stem the destruction caused by a supernova. For clarification, this crew will be referred to as Chris Pine's and the older movies as Shatner's.

In the movie Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home, a probe shows up in 2286 at Earth looking for whales that had disappeared decades before. Shatner's crew is faced with travelling back in time to try and retrieve two humpback whales in order to stop the cylindrical probe from destroying Earth. They do this using a Klingon Bird-of-Prey that was stolen in the previous movie, going back to 1986 to find the whales.

I think it's safe to assume that in Pine's reality, the probe will probably make an appearance again, since the destruction of whales probably wouldn't change. So Pine's crew will also be faced with the dilemma of travelling back to find humpbacks (although probably without using a Klingon ship).

If Pine's crew also goes back to the same instant in 1986 as Shatner's crew to find whales (which seems highly improbable given that hitting the same time period as Shatner would be ridiculous), would they run into Shatner's crew or would it create another parallel reality stemming from 1986? If it created another reality, that seems like some kind of backwards causality since the event that would be causing the new stem wouldn't be the instant before the ships arrived but an event in the future. Would time travel trump the parallel universe and both Kirks would be there at the same time?
",SocioMatt,https://scifi.stackexchange.com/users/6244,"I'm not sure if this is actually a parallel reality or a new timeline. The difference between the two I must admit goes over my head right now. However there is two main differences in the Pine Line (I'm coining that phrase) one events have been changed drastically; technology is more advanced and with the destruction of Vulcan certain elements of stories will not play out the same. That being said you are right the Entity that speaks whale is most likely sure to return which brings me to the second point. Old Spock is there and knows all about this.

I can't find a date for the whales extinction but if they are still around I'm sure he will make a priority of saving them. If they are not he knows advanced technology and will be able to give ample warning to the Pine Line to prepare and maybe even bring back the whales from the past. After all the Earth was under attack last time which is why the Shatner Line was saved by the Enterprise crew who were on exile on the planet Vulcan which is no more.

One of the advantages of the Pine Line is that it actually gets to retell the story without dismissing the original fan loved series or movies. However many things are changed and Nimoy Spock can be sort of a McGuffin used to fix or explain away serious consistences such as what will happen when the whales come.

4075,4075,6506,What is the cardinality of the family of unlabelled bipartite graphs on n vertices?,"I have attempted to calculate the number of unlabelled bipartite graphs as follows:


  Let $G = (V_1, V_2, E)$ be a bipartite graph on $n$ vertices with $|V_1| = m$ and $|V_2| = n-m$. Assume without loss of generality that $|V_1| \leq |V_2|$ so $m \leq \left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor$. If $G$ is complete bipartite then it has $m(n-m)$ edges since each of the vertices in $V_1$ is connected to each in $V_2$. Thus, the total number of bipartite graphs with parts of size $m$ and $n-m$ is $2^{m(n-m)}$. In order to find the total number of possible bipartite graphs on $n$ vertices we sum over all possible $m$:
  \begin{align}
\sum^{\left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor}_{m=1} 2^{m(n-m)}

""bicolored graphs"". A bicolored graph is a graph in which the vertices have been colored black and white so that every edge joins two vertices of different colors. A bipartite (or bicolorable) graph is a graph that has a bicoloring. A bicolorable graph with $k$ connected components has $2^k$ bicolorings. (In nonenumerative contexts the distinction between bipartite and bicolored is usually unimportant.) In addition, in counting  bicolored graphs one might or might not consider switching the two colors to give an equivalent graph. All of the versions of the enumeration problem have been solved. Counting unlabeled bicolored graphs (with no color-switching equivalence) is a straightforward application of Burnside's lemma; counting unlabeled bipartite graphs is tricky.

4522,4522,7167,NRZ vs. Manchester pulse shaping filter (Modulator),"I'm trying to visualize the differences on the output waveform of a modulator when using NRZ or a Manchester pulse shaping filter. To keep it simple, let's think of a binary PAM signal with an input bit sequence 101011. 

My thoughts are that with a Half Sine or a Raised Cosine pulse shaping filter, I will see the transitions between the 1's and 0's smooth out, but I'm struggling to think about the differences between the NRZ and the Manchester.
",Kyle Weller,https://dsp.stackexchange.com/users/3733,"Manchester coding effectively creates a bit sequence that is twice as long as the given bit sequence and then applies NRZ pulses to the resulting bit stream.
There are two types of Manchester coding. In one form, each $0$ in the original
sequence is replaced by $01$ and each $1$ by $10$ while the other form complements
these bit patterns.  Using the first form, 
$$101011 \to 10\,01\,10\,01\,10\,10$$ while the second form gives the complementary
bit sequence $01\,10\,01\,10\,0101$. If each data bit is of duration $T$, the NRZ
waveform with Half Sine pulses has sines of period $2T$ so that each bit
pulse has duration half a period. Thus, that leading $1$ gets
modulated to $\sin(\pi t/T)$ lasting from $t = 0$ till $t = T$.
With Manchester coding, each channel bit
(of duration $T/2$) gets a Half Sine of a sine of period $T$. Put another 
way, 


with plain NRZ, that first $1$ in your bit sequence will have
pulse $\sin(\pi t/T)$ lasting from $t = 0$ to $t = T$. This is a positive
going pulse rising from $0$ at $t=0$, peaking at $1$ at $t=T/2$, and
falling to $0$ at $t = T$
with Manchester coding, that data $1$ will become channel $10$ giving a positive pulse $\sin(2\pi t/T)$ from $0$ to $T/2$. The next channel bit
$0$ has the delayed half-sine pulse $\sin(2\pi (t-T/2)/T$ from $t=T/2$
to $t = T$, but with a negative amplitude (the channel bit 
during this interval is $0$ instead of a $1$) which
works out to be
$$\begin{align*}
-\sin(2\pi(t-T/2)/T) &amp;= -\sin(2\pi t/T - \pi)\\
&amp;= -\sin(2\pi t/T)\cos(\pi) + \cos(2\pi t/T)\sin(\pi)\\
&amp;= \sin(2\pi t/T)
\end{align*}$$
lasting from $t = T/2$ to $t = T$. In short, during the entire data
bit interval $[0,T]$ the signal can be expressed as $\sin(2\pi t/T)$
and is one cycle of the sine wave of period T. If the data
bit were a $0$ instead of a $1$, the channel bits would be $01$
and we would get $-\sin(2\pi t/T)$ from $t=0$ to $t=T$. In short,
Manchester coding with half-sine pulses
effectively creates a phase-modulated signal
from the data sequence with a carrier frequency of $1/T$ Hz and
each data bit interval contains exactly one period of the sinusoid.
If you look at the figure for Thomas's Manchester coding
in Wikipedia,
what we have is the $\pm$ rectangular pulses comprising each
data bit interval, which look like a hard-limited sinusoid
of period $T$, being replaced by the sinusoid.

279,279,450,How are integers internally represented at a bit level in Java?,"I am trying to understand how Java stores integer internally. I know all java primitive integers are signed, (except short?). That means one less bit available in a byte for the number.

My question is, are all integers (positive and negative) stored as two's complement or are only negative numbers in two's complement?

I see that the specs says x bit two's complement number. But I often get confused.

For instance:

  int x = 15; // Stored as binary as is?  00000000 00000000 00000000 00001111?
  int y = -22; // Stored as two complemented value? 11111111 11111111 11111111 11101010


Edit

To be clear, x = 15 

   In binary as is: `00000000 00000000 00000000 00001111'
  Two's complement: `11111111 11111111 11111111 11110001`


So if your answer is  all numbers are stored as two's complement then:

  int x = 15; // 11111111 11111111 11111111 11110001
  int y = -22 // 11111111 11111111 11111111 11101010


The confusion here again is the sign says, both are negative numbers. May be I am misreading / misunderstanding it?

Edit
Not sure my question is confusing. Forced to isolate the question:

My question precisely: Are positive numbers stored in binary as is while negative numbers are stored as two's complement?

Some said all are stored in two's complement and one answer says only negative numbers are stored as two's complement.
",Kevin Rave,https://stackoverflow.com/users/668650,"Java integers are of 32 bits, and always signed. This means, the most significant bit (MSB) works as the sign bit. The integer represented by an int is nothing but the weighted sum of the bits. The weights are assigned as follows:

Bit#    Weight
31      -2^31
30       2^30
29       2^29
...      ...
2        2^2
1        2^1
0        2^0


Note that the weight of the MSB is negative (the largest possible negative actually), so when this bit is on, the whole number (the weighted sum) becomes negative.

Let's simulate it with 4-bit numbers:

Binary    Weighted sum            Integer value
0000       0 + 0 + 0 + 0           0
0001       0 + 0 + 0 + 2^0         1
0010       0 + 0 + 2^1 + 0         2
0011       0 + 0 + 2^1 + 2^0       3
0100       0 + 2^2 + 0 + 0         4
0101       0 + 2^2 + 0 + 2^0       5
0110       0 + 2^2 + 2^1 + 0       6
0111       0 + 2^2 + 2^1 + 2^0     7 -&gt; the most positive value
1000      -2^3 + 0 + 0 + 0        -8 -&gt; the most negative value
1001      -2^3 + 0 + 0 + 2^0      -7
1010      -2^3 + 0 + 2^1 + 0      -6
1011      -2^3 + 0 + 2^1 + 2^0    -5
1100      -2^3 + 2^2 + 0 + 0      -4
1101      -2^3 + 2^2 + 0 + 2^0    -3
1110      -2^3 + 2^2 + 2^1 + 0    -2
1111      -2^3 + 2^2 + 2^1 + 2^0  -1


So, the two's complement thing is not an exclusive scheme for representing negative integers, rather we can say that the binary representation of integers are always the same, we just negate the weight of the most significant bit. And that bit determines the sign of the integer.

In C, there is a keyword unsigned (not available in java), which can be used for declaring unsigned int x;. In the unsigned integers, the weight of the MSB is positive (2^31) rather than being negative. In that case the range of an unsigned int is 0 to 2^32 - 1, while an int has range -2^31 to 2^31 - 1.

From another point of view, if you consider the two's complement of x as ~x + 1 (NOT x plus one), here's the explanation:

For any x, ~x is just the bitwise inverse of x, so wherever x has a 1-bit, ~x will have a 0-bit there (and vice versa). So, if you add these up, there will be no carry in the addition and the sum will be just an integer every bit of which is 1.

For 32-bit integers:

x + ~x = 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111
x + ~x + 1 =   1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 + 1
           = 1 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000


The leftmost 1-bit will simply be discarded, because it doesn't fit in 32-bits (integer overflow). So,

x + ~x + 1 = 0
-x = ~x + 1


So you can see that the negative x can be represented by ~x + 1, which we call the two's complement of x.

I didn't read the article, but this could be read in one of two ways:


MD5, even when salted is bad.
Salted hashes are bad.


In response to the first one, yes, this is true. MD5 has been proven insecure, and is too fast to be a secure hashing function anyways. Don't use MD5.

As for the second, it's completely wrong. Always salt your hash's. This helps prevent against rainbow table attacks.


  It isn't uncommon to break/crack unix shadow files.

This used to be true. The reason for doing this is to make it much slower per password attempt (since you have to run the hashing algorithm a lot). Even with a modern hash like SHA2, it's still often so fast that brute forcing a poorly chosen password can take a matter of days, or even hours.

Modern digest algorithms take this into account, and are designed to be computationally, or memory intensive. Common examples include bcrypt which includes a salt and is designed to be computationally expensive. A newer algorithm, scrypt, has been getting a bit of attention recently for also being memory intensive (making GPU cracking that much more difficult).

I didn't read the article, but this could be read in one of two ways:


MD5, even when salted is bad.
Salted hashes are bad.


In response to the first one, yes, this is true. MD5 has been proven insecure, and is too fast to be a secure hashing function anyways. Don't use MD5.

As for the second, it's completely wrong. Always salt your hash's. This helps prevent against rainbow table attacks.

2907,2907,4623,Does a laptop computer charge faster when off?,"A laptop power supply can supply a limited amount of power. Conceivably, then, when the computer is running, some of the power must be diverted to the processor and other components, leaving less to charge the battery.

1361,1361,2142,How do I ward properly in DotA 2?,"I finally got my DotA 2 Beta invite. Now to learn the game I read it's a good start to play support heros (like I already loved to do in League of Legends). Even though I'm still pretty new to the game I suspect it's mostly the supports job to buy and set up wards.

I am therefore interested in learning how to ward effectively.


What are good/important spots for wards?
How do I time wards? When should I leave the lane?
And if there there different types of wards like in LoL: when to use which one?

",fschl,https://gaming.stackexchange.com/users/1400,"The linked guide that Arremer posted here is absolutely awesome, but it's probably a bit much for a very new player. When I teach new players I gave them 8 good ward spots to use- some more basic than others. I've circled them on the image linked: 




First, there are the two obvious ward spots near the runes. These are your default spots, and they're thus the most likely to be counterwarded. You should use others if you start getting counterwarded.
Next, there are the wards which block the pull camps. Blocking these should be done almost automatically in every game with the first set of wards bought. These are the circled spots in the image with the pink lines coming from them, which indicate the blocked camp. They can be a bit tricky to place, so try it out in a practice game.
Finally, there are 4 offensive ward spots. These are more situational in their use, but they're also the most important to allow you to take advantage of your team being ahead. If you don't ward offensively when you have a lead, you're inviting the other team back into the game. The yellow spots are the most well known, but the other two spots are nearly as good.


There is so much to warding that it's something you'll improve at for a very long time. For a complete new player, these are where I'd suggest starting.

So an overview: with your 2 wards at the start place one that's able to see a rune location, and one to block the pull camp. Try to do this right around 0:00, but not before, so that your mid hero is able to see where the 6:00 rune spawns. (Observer Wards last 6 minutes). This is pretty important. From there, keep wards up in the middle and maybe place aggressive wards if you know you can do so safely. Mostly you're concerned with keeping an eye on gank attempts and Roshan in the midgame. After you take T2 towers with your team, worry about getting offensive wards placed after you win teamfights. This will let you secure the game. Good support players are way more influential in Dota2 than they are in LoL, but it's still the same thankless role and much harder to accomplish.

I suggest you read my reply here too to know how to understand counterwarding, which is done with blue Sentry Wards (they last 3 minutes).

3231,3231,5154,Who should pursue a Ph.D degree?,"I am asking myself the question ""Should I do PhD or should I leave academia and go for an industrial career?""

My life-goal is being a professor. And I love to do research. 

PhD is surely a bite that not everyone can chew.
But I wonder who can chew it?

I never was good at tests and exams. My BSc. GPA was 2.84/4.00 but finished my MSc. with 3.50/4.00

However, currently I am working on a conference paper and I feel like even that is too much for me. It has been nearly 3 months and still, the paper draft is to be improved (not the wording but the content).

I am surely a hard-worker but not always. Sometimes, I let go of my work and absorbed in other stuff (composing, amateur radio etc). If this period is too wide, I have to spend double effort to warm-up and remember where I left.

I don't know how things work in PhD. It usually is 5-6 years. It is the one of two most-challenging milestones in academic career (the other is getting the title Assoc. Prof).
Should I completely be a ""nerd"" and work on my thesis systematically (something I could never make in my entire life) or working periodically but with extra effort is still sufficient?

So, here's my question: If I say ""I'm considering to do PhD"" and ask your advice, what would you ask me? What kind of skills/characteristics do you look for a potential academician?

I know it is way too late for me to ask this kind of question, as a person who almost finished his master's degree. But better lose the saddle than the horse.

  your advice, what would you ask me? What kind of
  skills/characteristics do you look for a potential academician?


The first questions I would ask is: are you really interested in the subject? Can you imagine spending the next 5+ years thinking about pretty much nothing else?
Why do you want to do a PhD in the first place?


  However, currently I am working on a conference paper and I feel like

Now imagine the same thing but replace 3 month with 3 years.


  Sometimes, I let go of my  work and absorbed in other stuff.


This is also not very helpful for pursuing a PhD.

I think in most fields (that might be different for some fields of science) getting a PhD is only for people who want to do research. Apart from that it is only a waste of time and money. So the question you should ask yourself is not: Am I able to get a PhD? But rather: Do I want to get a PhD?

However, if you decided that you really want to give it a try: talk to someone from your university about it, maybe the supervisor of your thesis. Grades are not always a good indicator of the quality as a researcher.



EDIT:


  My life-goal is being a professor. And I love to do research.


That answers most of the questions.


  But I don't know if I'm capable of doing a Ph.D.


No one here can answer this question. You should try to talk to a professor at your university, the supervisor of your Master's Thesis, or someone who is doing research you are interested in.

2597,2597,4131,"Buck converter with op-amp, inductor issues when load changes","I'm looking at the designs for a simple buck converter which has the P mosfet, inductor, capacitor and reverse based diode. Instead of PWM, I'm trying out to use an op-amp to switch the P mosfet but one thing that I notice is that if the load changes from low resistance to high resistance then the inductor spikes the voltage on the load to double what it is until it can re-stablise. (This is all in simulation)

Is this happening because I'm using the op-amp? How does using PWM affect the inductor in such a way that if the load would change from say 10 ohms to 100 ohms that the inductor won't spike the voltage? Perhaps PWM / fast switching keeps the inductor with such a low charge that when the load changes, the inductor doesn't have nearly enough voltage to do anything?

Cheers.
",2tails,https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/29571,"For any given load, a switcher will transfer a given amount of energy thousands of times per second. This is how the buck regulator works.

Let's say your op-amp is switching at 10kHz (because it's a slow sort of device and will have slew rate problems compared to other devices). Let's also say you are aiming to deliver 5V across a 10 ohm resistor. Resistor power is 25/10 watts = 2.5 watts. 

To calculate energy per switching cycle divide this power by frequency because power = joules per second. At 10kHz, the energy you transfer per switch cycle is 250\$\mu J\$. 

This energy powers your load resistor but, if you removed your load resistor, this energy gets dumped into the output capacitor and its voltage rises a little (or a lot) higher than normal.

Let's say your output capacitor is 10uF - if suddenly it was imbibed with 250\$\mu J\$, how much would it rise in voltage?

We know that capacitor energy is \$\dfrac{C V^2}{2}\$ therefore we can calculate the voltage rise and this is: - 

\$\sqrt{\dfrac{250\times 10^{-6} \times 2}{10\times 10^{-6}}}\$ = 7.07V.

It's a little bit subtler than this - in the above I assumed the capacitor was being charged with energy from a zero voltage state. In fact it already has 5V across it and this means that the previously stored energy + influx energy (from the inductor) is 125\$\mu J\$ + 250\$\mu J\$ = 375\$\mu J\$. 

If you do the reverse math, the peak voltage on the capacitor becomes 8.66V i.e. 3.66 volts higher than the 5V rail. 

You could put an argument together to consider the losses in the diode also - this may trim half a volt of the absolute peak voltage.

So, you either need to increase the capacitance a lot or, decrease the transfer energy by increasing the operating frequency. Modern switchers regularly operate at 500kHz and this means the energy per cycle reduces from 250\$\mu J\$ to 5\$\mu J\$ in this example.

Should this be the case (500kHz operation), the rogue energy from the inductor would make the capacitor's stored energy 130\$\mu J\$ and this means a peak voltage of 5.1 volts - probably quite acceptable for load dumping on a switcher.

Operating at higher frequencies requires faster silicon but, the ability to control load variations (and their repercussions), on a cyclic basis, means much tighter control of the output voltage.

This is just an example to see where you might be going wrong.

Rage says, in part,


  While raging, a barbarian cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except for Balance, Escape Artist, Intimidate, and Ride), the Concentration skill, or any abilities that require patience or concentration, nor can he cast spells or activate magic items that require a command word, a spell trigger (such as a wand), or spell completion (such as a scroll) to function. He can use any feat he has except Combat Expertise, item creation feats, and metamagic feats. (PH 25).


That raging restricts other abilities requiring patience and concentration, but never specifies what those might be, means the DM has a free hand in declaring certain tasks require patience and concentration and therefore are beyond the raging barbarian. But the DM should probably rarely place such restrictions on tasks, given the limits present later in the description of rage.

Thus, as no mention's made of the raging creature being unable to do it, fighting defensively (PH 140) remains an option, as does total defense (PH 142).

It is odd, but the Player's Handbook just doesn't restrict rage beyond these limits. The game says that if it's not on this list (or specifically prohibited by an option in a later book), the barbarian can probably do it while raging; so it's perfectly acceptable for a barbarian, for example, to apply extra sneak attack damage if he has any, the target's vulnerable to it, and the circumstances mean he'd inflict it; fight defensively or use total defense; attempt disarms or otherwise use nonlethal force; and take the withdraw action.

The goal is to limit the raging barbarians' actions in exchange for increased combat prowess not precisely simulate violent psychopathy in a table top role-playing game. In this case an exclusive list is better than an inclusive list (i.e. the raging barbarian can't do these things versus the raging barbarian can only do these things) because the game knew dozens of books with far more options would follow, so rather than limiting the raging barbarian to actions--requiring every future option to note if a barbarian could use it while raging--, it prevents him from taking some actions, so the raging barbarian can use future options freely.

3211,3211,5121,Rotating vector3 by a quaternion,"I am attempting to rotate a vector3 by a given quaternion.

I know that this is true

v' = q * v * (q^-1)


I know that q^(-1) is the inverse which just -q/magnitude(q), but how do I map the multiplication of the vector to the quaternion to get back a vector?

I have found that you can treat v as a matrix, and convert q, and q' to matrices, and then convert v' from a matrix to a vector, but this seems a little over the top just to get a vector. Is there a cleaner implementation that I could use?
",gardian06,https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/users/14586,"As Nathan Reed and teodron exposed, the recipe for rotating a vector v by a unit-length quaternion q is:

1) Create a pure quaternion p out of v. This simply means adding a fourth coordinate of 0:



2) Pre-multiply it with q and post-multiply it with the conjugate q*:



3) This will result in another pure quaternion which can be turned back to a vector:



This vector v' is v rotated by q.



This is working but far from optimal. Quaternion multiplications mean tons and tons of operations. I was curious about various implementations such as this one, and decided to find from where those came. Here are my findings.

We can also describe q as the combination of a 3-dimensional vector u and a scalar s:



By the rules of quaternion multiplication, and as the conjugate of a unit length quaternion is simply it's inverse, we get:



The scalar part (ellipses) results in zero, as detailed here. What's interesting is the vector part, AKA our rotated vector v'. It can be simplified using some basic vector identities:



This is now much more optimal; two dot products, a cross product and a few extras: around half the operations. Which would give something like that in source code (assuming some generic vector math library):

void rotate_vector_by_quaternion(const Vector3&amp; v, const Quaternion&amp; q, Vector3&amp; vprime)
{
    // Extract the vector part of the quaternion
    Vector3 u(q.x, q.y, q.z);

    // Extract the scalar part of the quaternion
    float s = q.w;

    // Do the math
    vprime = 2.0f * dot(u, v) * u
          + (s*s - dot(u, u)) * v

1) Create a pure quaternion p out of v. This simply means adding a fourth coordinate of 0:



2) Pre-multiply it with q and post-multiply it with the conjugate q*:



3) This will result in another pure quaternion which can be turned back to a vector:



This vector v' is v rotated by q.



This is working but far from optimal. Quaternion multiplications mean tons and tons of operations. I was curious about various implementations such as this one, and decided to find from where those came. Here are my findings.

We can also describe q as the combination of a 3-dimensional vector u and a scalar s:



By the rules of quaternion multiplication, and as the conjugate of a unit length quaternion is simply it's inverse, we get:



The scalar part (ellipses) results in zero, as detailed here. What's interesting is the vector part, AKA our rotated vector v'. It can be simplified using some basic vector identities:



This is now much more optimal; two dot products, a cross product and a few extras: around half the operations. Which would give something like that in source code (assuming some generic vector math library):

void rotate_vector_by_quaternion(const Vector3&amp; v, const Quaternion&amp; q, Vector3&amp; vprime)
{
    // Extract the vector part of the quaternion
    Vector3 u(q.x, q.y, q.z);

    // Extract the scalar part of the quaternion
    float s = q.w;

    // Do the math
    vprime = 2.0f * dot(u, v) * u
          + (s*s - dot(u, u)) * v
          + 2.0f * s * cross(u, v);
}

and AttrA, AttrB and AttrC values are stored in tables with respective data type.

Now using the basic syntax, I am able to add value of attributes AttrA, AttrB and AttrC. Which is:

$model = Mage::getModel('customer/address');
$model-&gt;setAttrA('ValA')-&gt;setAttrB('ValB')-&gt;setAttrC('ValC');


doing this correctly sets the values of AttrA, AttrB and AttrC but value of parent_id in customer_entity sets to NULL by default.

Here I want to be able to set the parent_id to some other value.

I am looking at buying an older (10 yrs old) Giant NRS 1 MTB, it has very good reviews for the frame especially, but other parts have been replaced (it has a new front wheel, cables etc.). Should I be worried that other parts will be about to fall off, or are replacements a good thing?

EDIT: Ok so the wheel was replaced due to hitting a stump at night time, the cables were getting old, it has had plenty of action, but was well looked after. The rear sus has a tiny bit of play in the top bush (not enough to realise when riding)

It also has a leaking front fork, not a big issue (probably new seal, or not worry), but makes me wonder if it is worth it, will cost around $400 US ish, do you think it will have other issues?

First, computing ""mean impact factor"" for a person or group is insane and should be resisted at all costs.  Even amongst IF-crazy groups, the metric is generally how many high-IF publications have been obtained (ignoring low-IF publications), not the fraction of high-IF publications.

",T. Webster,https://programmers.stackexchange.com/users/19936,"There are broadly 4 ways:

Build Seniority

If you're happy with your current company and want to stay there, a good way to be able to demand more is to become the senior resident expert at a vital technology and/or internal code base. I've watched people do this at several companies I've worked at. They became so obviously and publicly super-productive and good at what they do (and the thing they do was important) that they naturally gained a ""senior"" status - even without necessarily getting team leading or managerial responsibility per se.

I can only presume that they had more ammunition to ask for better raises at performance review time, and for some I knew for a fact that they were better paid than average.

Also, see this answer.

Change Employers

This is essentially this answer. You have to be careful with this one though. Lots of very short stints don't look good on a CV, even if there are reasonably good explanations for the moves. For contracts with fixed terms, it's not so bad, but you don't want to have a whole string of permanent salaried positions on your CV that are all under 1-2 years or so. 3-4 years and up is probably okay though, as an average.

Go Contracting/Consulting

This one is, in a way, Change Employers on steroids. If you find a good niche which has a shortage of qualified engineers and quite a bit of short term project work that needs doing, this can be an excellent option. But it's quite a different mindset and lifestyle than having normal permanent salaried jobs (I've never done it personally, but I've known lots of people who did). 

Vertical Movement

I know you asked about ""programmer salary"", but it still feels like this is obligatory to mention. Rising to team leader and/or management roles is always a possible option.

My astronomy teacher says that gravity is (note: not like) a 3D blanket and when you put mass on it, the mass causes a dip/dent in the blanket and so if you put another object with less mass it will roll down the dip onto the bigger mass. Is this true and is this what causes the centripetal force. 
",Jonathan.,https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/4,"A centripetal force is a force directed towards the centre. It's just a characterisation of an existing force. ""Centripetal"" means ""towards the centre"" in Greek.

So, in the solar system, the sun exerts a gravitational force towards itself, and it is a centripetal force.

Regarding your other question: how does gravity work? According to general relativity, energetic or massive objects distort space, so that other objects passing through the distorted space do not go straight, but bend their trajectory. From their point of view, they experience a force (gravity), and consequentially an acceleration which changes their trajectory.
So according to general relativity the medium through which gravity acts is actually the distortion of space.
This is what your astronomy teacher called ""a 3D blanket"".

Instead, according to Quantum Field Theory, forces are mediated by appropriate particles actually moving through space. Gravity would be carried by particles known as gravitons.

1091,1091,1721,What are the implications of Emmet's autonomous movement?,"During The Lego Movie we learn that the whole LEGO world is actually a universe existing within ours, or to be precise, in the basement of a real human family and that the whole story is actually played out by a little boy named Finn and a way for him to cope with the conflict of his strict and fantasy-inhibiting father. And indeed this is again strengthened when we see that the actions as performed by his father when supposedly ""repairing the mess"" that Finn created are directly represented by Lord Business' micromanagers performing them inside the in-universe viewpoint of the other LEGO figures.

Upto this point that is a reasonable and obvious representation to me and even Emmet's direct witness of the universe behind his, our real world, is nothing but him seeing the strips behind the course of his own universe, however he managed to overcome this boundary between dimensions. But the single-most action that completely shatters this whole viewpoint is the incident, when Emmet manages to move completely on his own, thus directly interfering with our universe on his own and it seems to me that there is no way to bring this in congruence to our own physical reality, not even when accepting the LEGO world and its course as an emanation of Finn's fantasy, since Finn didn't do anything at all.

So what are we to make of this incident? Does it have any deeper implications for the depicted realities? Does this establish the LEGO figures as existent and sentient within our physical reality outside of our mere fantasy? Does it have any further signficance for the meaning of the whole story and actually extend the rather simple and obvious kid's fantasy interpretation of the story in a much more elaborate way I have missed? Or is this just to be brushed off as nothing of relevance?

Not only was he able to cross between his world to Finn's (and back again), but his reformation of President Business has also somehow triggered The Man Upstairs to look differently at his hobby.

Are they equivalent?  

'The arts' is a common but woolly term and 'art' is notoriously difficult to pin down.  Oxforddictionaries.com gives the following definitions:


  
  art [mass noun] the expression or application of human creative skill and imagination, typically in a visual form such as painting or sculpture, producing works to be appreciated primarily for their beauty or emotional power  
  (the arts) the various branches of creative activity, such as painting, music, literature, and dance
  


What practical differences in usage are there (if any)?

",z7sg Ѫ,https://english.stackexchange.com/users/5964,"Looking at etymology

art


  early 13c., ""skill as a result of learning or practice,"" from O.Fr. art (10c.), from L. artem (nom. ars) ""work of art; practical skill; a business, craft,"" from PIE *ar-ti- (cf. Skt. rtih ""manner, mode;"" Gk. arti ""just,"" artios ""complete, suitable,"" artizein ""to prepare;"" L. artus ""joint;"" Armenian arnam ""make;"" Ger. art ""manner, mode""), from base *ar- ""fit together, join"" (see arm (1)). In M.E. usually with sense of ""skill in scholarship and learning"" (c.1300), especially in the seven sciences, or liberal arts. This sense remains in Bachelor of Arts, etc. Meaning ""human workmanship"" (as opposed to nature) is from late 14c. Sense of ""cunning and trickery"" first attested c.1600. Meaning ""skill in creative arts"" is first recorded 1610s; especially of painting, sculpture, etc., from 1660s. Broader sense of the word remains in artless.
  
  Fine arts, ""those which appeal to the mind and the imagination"" first recorded 1767. Expression art for art's sake (1836) translates Fr. l'art pour l'art. First record of art critic is from 1865. Arts and crafts ""decorative design and handcraft"" first attested in the Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society, founded in London, 1888.


Shows how the meanings evolved from a wider meaning into a more narrow one. In context of Bachelor of Arts, it is obvious that it refers to ""skill in scholarship and learning"". 

Today when we talk about artist and art the immediate association are paintings, sculptures and other ""works to be appreciated primarily for their beauty or emotional power"". 

However some connotations from older meanings still remain:


in the expression ""art of making something"" we don't refer to l'art pur l'art, but we refer to craftsmanship (an older meaning)   
in slightly metaphorical sense, ""art of..."" can be taken to mean skill, as in art of persuasion, art of motorcycle maintenance (wikipedia), art of war, rather then art that is normally exhibited in a gallery
in ""college of arts and sciences"", arts refer to ""studies intended to provide general knowledge and intellectual skills""

art


  early 13c., ""skill as a result of learning or practice,"" from O.Fr. art (10c.), from L. artem (nom. ars) ""work of art; practical skill; a business, craft,"" from PIE *ar-ti- (cf. Skt. rtih ""manner, mode;"" Gk. arti ""just,"" artios ""complete, suitable,"" artizein ""to prepare;"" L. artus ""joint;"" Armenian arnam ""make;"" Ger. art ""manner, mode""), from base *ar- ""fit together, join"" (see arm (1)). In M.E. usually with sense of ""skill in scholarship and learning"" (c.1300), especially in the seven sciences, or liberal arts. This sense remains in Bachelor of Arts, etc. Meaning ""human workmanship"" (as opposed to nature) is from late 14c. Sense of ""cunning and trickery"" first attested c.1600. Meaning ""skill in creative arts"" is first recorded 1610s; especially of painting, sculpture, etc., from 1660s. Broader sense of the word remains in artless.
  
  Fine arts, ""those which appeal to the mind and the imagination"" first recorded 1767. Expression art for art's sake (1836) translates Fr. l'art pour l'art. First record of art critic is from 1865. Arts and crafts ""decorative design and handcraft"" first attested in the Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society, founded in London, 1888.


Shows how the meanings evolved from a wider meaning into a more narrow one. In context of Bachelor of Arts, it is obvious that it refers to ""skill in scholarship and learning"". 

Today when we talk about artist and art the immediate association are paintings, sculptures and other ""works to be appreciated primarily for their beauty or emotional power"". 

However some connotations from older meanings still remain:


in the expression ""art of making something"" we don't refer to l'art pur l'art, but we refer to craftsmanship (an older meaning)   
in slightly metaphorical sense, ""art of..."" can be taken to mean skill, as in art of persuasion, art of motorcycle maintenance (wikipedia), art of war, rather then art that is normally exhibited in a gallery
in ""college of arts and sciences"", arts refer to ""studies intended to provide general knowledge and intellectual skills""

3722,3722,5933,Why does resizing PNG with alpha transparency make edges gray?,"I'm using PSP 7 (I know it's old, but it serves my purposes).

I am resizing a bunch of images. PNG images with alpha transparency load with black backgrounds when I first open them. I have little experience with masks. I learned that I can do Masks > Load From Alpha Channel to see the transparent areas.

After loading the alpha channel, I resize the image. Usually, this works fine. However, sometimes the edges look a bit gray - kind of like if I made a transparent GIF on a gray background.

For the record, the box for Resize all layers is checked. If I uncheck that, the edges are black after resize. Also, the original images are already PNG-24 (16 million colors).

Here is the original viewed at 8x zoom (scaled in the browser to fit):



And here it is after reszing viewed at 8x zoom:



And here is the resized image viewed at 1x zoom:



It's probably not that noticeable to a lot of people, but the top edge does not look smooth to me.

Is there an easy way to fix this? Do I need to resize the mask separately?

The last one I had like this was a white circle. So I just cropped out the edges and added a white circle behind it. This one is a little harder.

24,24,32,What are the benefits of owning a physical book?,"I have seen this question about updates of the D&amp;D 4th Edition books, and it got me thinking.
Since I got my Kindle I have not read a single paper novel; they have fewer drawbacks compared to digital copies than rpg rulebooks.


Dead-tree types have some benefits like looking good on a bookshelf, but any ebook reader weighs less with 100 novels than the usual hard-cover book. 
If you want to look for the damage of Ares Alpha, even with a half-decent tablet it takes less than 2 seconds.  
Digital copies do not get worn, they never get unwanted earmarks, but you can bookmark them.
Rulebooks do get updates, and unless you are willing to take a pen to your book, your hard copies will never contain them. The pdfs can be edited and resent to the buyers. 
Even better is the WotC approach with the DDI, you can look up any monster or item or (almost any) rule, in the most recent form, for 3 years at the cost of seven books. 


I think this is the way to go, even considering the horribly slow character builder. Although I must admit good illustration can help build the athmosphere.

So what am I missing? Why are people buying rpg rulebooks in paper format? Why are books even published, I do not need to know if feats are supposed to be on the right page and skills on the left, I just want a list of them, filterable any way I want. 

Is this just a necessary part of earning money? I understand that pdfs are copied illegally, but the Compendium is not. 
",András,https://rpg.stackexchange.com/users/9552,"As others have said - there's definitely something to be said about tactile navigation. 

While digital formats (assuming they're text-parseable) can be searched, if you don't know the specific spelling or the specific term, they can be difficult to parse by hand. Quadruply so if the publisher did not provide bookmarks to the different chapters. (Which is really annoying, imo.)

By contrast, with a physical copy, you can pick up a general sense of where the desired content is physically located fairly quickly. For example: Combat Rules are towards the middle. Spell lists are towards the end. Character classes are near the beginning. The more familiar one is with the book, the quicker this is to process (and more accurate one tends to get).

Additionally - I stare at a digital monitor all day at work; then for most of the evening. So if I actually have to read something, I'll opt for ink on paper, just to save my eyes that itty little bit. :) 

(Kindles are awesome, but they can be slow; plus, some books have art work and/or tables that I am unsure would translate over very well.)

1997,1997,3190,Woocommerce: change user role after completing order,":)

I'm using wordpress with woocommerce, and I would like to automate the following step. When an order is completed, I would like to change the user role associated with that order id from 'customer' to 'subscriber'.



By searching around, I think I should be able to accomplish this by using a hook in functions.php:

add_action( 'woocommerce_order_status_completed', 'change_role_from_customer_to_subscriber' );


Then add the function:

function change_role_from_customer_to_subscriber($order_id){
// code to change role to subscriber
}


In the code, I think I need to do 2 things:
1) get the user id that is associated with that order id
2) change role of that user id to subscriber



I've tried a lot, but I couldn't get it to work (neither getting the right user id, nor changing the role of a user id). So any help would be appreciated! I've seen 2 related questions asked before on stack overflow, but unfortunately the answers there did not work for me. I hope someone can help me out!

Thanks a lot! :)


Edit:
Someone helped me out with the second part of the problem, so that's great news for me :)

Unfortunately, I still haven't figured out the first part: how to get the user id that is associated with the order id.
Any ideas?
",Rostam,https://wordpress.stackexchange.com/users/41126,"Looking through the code there is a very relevant example:

        $old_spent = absint( get_user_meta( $order-&gt;user_id, '_money_spent', true ) );

I used dbpoweramp in windows, and I'm pretty sure it converted them all, but when I woke up this morning, the netbook had been restarted.

So I've made a list with all my music in it and used sort to alphabetize it. So I have something like this:

Note that I have a directory with only mp3, since not my whole library was flac.

What I want is a bash script that will check that all lines that end with .flac have a line directly below them that is the same except it ends with .mp3.

How would I achieve this, and if you can explain what the script is doing, that would be cool too.

I guess it's sorta important to show any lines that end with .flac that DON'T have a matching .mp3, as they need converted still.

It depends on how less coefficients are needed to describe the image in an acceptable quality.

Without your monitors plugged in, right-click on your desktop, hover over ""View"" and turn off the feature ""Align icons to grid""
Plug in your monitor and proceed only if your icons remain in their original positions
Turn ""Align icons to grid"" back on the same way you turned it off.


Using the steps above, this should allow you to unplug/turn-off monitors and replug/turn-on monitors without your icons moving all over the place.

I noticed with this, however, that it's save-file-like and you will need to redo the steps if you want to move icons around.

I would assume there are since the challenges and priorities for the two groups are normally somewhat different, but I'm not sure exactly how it would differ. For instance, it might be more difficult for the new PI to recruit students (especially good ones) when they have to ""compete"" with older, better funded peers. This would lead one to think that new PIs might be more likely to take on students they might not necessarily love, but just need bodies in the lab. However, on the other hand, new PIs are more likely to have limited funding, and if they are on the tenure-track, would need their few students to succeed in order to establish a name for themselves in the industry. In this case, it would be detrimental if they chose the wrong student(s) in the beginning, especially if they are limited to the number of students they can afford due to funding issues. I realize that this is field and situation specific, but I'm looking to hear stories/insights from people who have gone through/know about the process.

Thanks!

2651,2651,4210,How do I burn a DVD with more than 3.8 GB data?,"I use Kubuntu 12.04 with KDE 4.8.3 and wodim / genisoimage 1.1.11, but the problem is on Ubuntu (with Brasero) and occurred in Oneiric as well.

Whenever I try to burn more than 3.8GB (approaching the 4 GB limit) of data onto a DVD, burning fails, aborts, or gives an ""error 254.""

I have lost more than 50 DVDs this way until I learned about the 3.8GB limit. Anything under 3.8GB burns fine, and DVDs burned with more than 3.8GB have usable data up to 3.8 GB, but then the remaining data is garbled, unaccessible, or the disk is just not recognized.

I'm pretty certain this is related to the replacement of cdrecord / mkisofs with wodim /genioimage (which is a problem that has been described for years). Is there another answer or fix? Re-installing cdrtools/cdrecord/mkisofs in Oneiric and Precise has become a herculean task.

There are different types of DVDs that support different capacities. According to the wikipedia article (Capacity and nomenclature of (re)writable discs), there are two versions of DVD-R discs, ~3.68 GiB and ~4.37GiB (Don't look at GB, but GiB, that's the actual data capacity).

Always look at what's printed on the DVD, they usually mention if they're DVD-R or DVD+R. If they don't mention anything (i.e. no-named), don't buy them, unless you're up for the risk.

Prefer DVD+R (no specific reason, but if you need one, they don't have 2 versions and are 4.37 GiB in capacity).

You could also try the dual layered dvds, which provide ~8 GiB in capacity.

For testing purposes buy 2-3 DVD+RW discs.
Burn at low speeds, 4x recommended.
Devices such as dvd burners die eventually (at least in my case), after 2-3 years they become faulty. For example, burning worked in my case, except that I couldn't boot using any cd/dvd media.

How large is the shock to the embouchure and how costly is it to then move back?
",Nathan Cooper,https://music.stackexchange.com/users/5757,"Completely disregarding the issue of the written music (which others have answered well), my experience as a trumpeter has been that the embouchure is the bigger problem.

I had no problem adjusting to playing the Eb horn after only a few hours of practice. The bigger embouchure used means that I surely didn't get as fine a tone as an experienced players, but it was enough to get by with. Since then, I've doubled numerous times on Eb and the switch is now very easy for me.

22,22,30,"2 servers, high availability and faster response","I recently bought a second webserver because I worry about hardware failure of my old server. Now that I have that second server I wish to do a little more then just have one server standby and replicate all day. As long as it's there I might as well get some advantage our of it !

I have a website powered by ubuntu 12.04, nginx, php-fpm, apc, mysql (5.5) and couchdb.

Im currently testing configurations where i can achieve failover AND make good use of the extra harware for faster responses / distributed load.

The setup I am testing nowinvolves heartbeat for ip failover and two identical servers. Of the two servers only one has a public ip adress. If one server crashes the other server takes over the public ip adress. On an incoming request nginx forwards the request tot php-fpm to either server a of server b (50/50 if both servers are alive). Once the request has been send to php-fpm both servers look at localhost for the mysql server. I use master-master mysql replication for this. The file system is synced with lsyncd.

This works pretty well but Im reading it's discouraged by the (mysql) community.

Another option I could think of is to use one server as a mysql master and one server as a web/php server. The servers would still sync their filesystem, would still run the same duplicate software (nginx,mysql) but master slave mysql replication could be used. As long as bother servers are alive I could just prefer nginx to listen to ip a and mysql to ip b. If one server is down, the other server could take over the task of the other server, simply by ip switching. 

But im completely new at this so I would greatly value your expert advice. Is either of the two setups any good ? If you have any thoughts on this please let me know !

PS, virtualisation, hosting on different locations or active/passive setups are not solutions im looking for. I find virtual server either too slow or too expensive. I already have a passive failover on another location. But in case of a crash I found the site was still unreachable for too long due to dns caching.

    ""internet"": true,

Do not run when running on battery.

Run only one disk heavy task at a time.


The maintenance script takes care of that, and I can run it whenever I have sufficient time to let the tasks run. If not, I can just abort all the tasks and restart it later.

However, the image of the on-sensor dust particles should not, to my understanding, be affected by the sharpness induced by the lens settings. Same is true for dust particle on the lens elements themselves. It makes me wonder - do these people misunderstand the theory of how the optical system work, or am I missing something?
",ysap,https://photo.stackexchange.com/users/1024,"If the dust was really on the sensor proper, you'd be absolutely correct.

At least in the normal case, it's virtually impossible for dust to get on the surface of the sensor itself, because there's a couple millimeters or so of filters directly in front of the sensor. The front-most of these is (at least in the usual case) the AA filer.

The important thing is that all of this transparent glass. Therefore, with a wider aperture, there's more light coming at the sensor from various angles. Since the light can travel at whatever angle through those filters (because they're all at least mostly-transparent glass), the dust spots won't normally block all the light. With a smaller aperture, the light comes nearly straight back from the small aperture, so the edges of any dust spots are clearly defined.

In practice, the difference is pretty obvious. Here's a shot at f/1.7, then shot taken a few moments later at f/22 (same camera, same lens, etc. -- all that's changed is the aperture and shutter speed):

If you apply it to the f/1.7 picture (as I did above, to keep things fair), that will also overemphasize the light falloff at the corners of the picture. Though there is some anyway, it's not normally even close to as bad as it looks in the first shot above.

Note that this is a pretty rigorous test. This sensor is clean enough that on typical shots, there's no sign of dust on the sensor at all.

If you test this on your own camera, don't be too surprised if it looks (quite possibly a lot) worse than the ones above.

4521,4521,7166,Differences in student load at liberal arts colleges vs. research universities,"Do students at liberal arts universities have 'harder' courses than students at research universities? 

Computer Science curricula at large research universities have 5 to 6 courses per semester. The Liberal Arts model dictates roughly 4 courses per semester. If the load on the student is considered to be equivalent, there must be something special to the teaching in the Liberal Arts model.

How is it that a 4 course Liberal Arts semester is as intensive as a 6 course research university semester?

UPDATE: Many of the comments below say the course load I mention above is inaccurate. I have obtained the figures as follows.


The Liberal Arts Computer Science Consortium (LACS) has released 3 LACS curricula in response to ACM/IEEE CS curriculum recommendations. The first in 1986 in response to the 1978 recommendation, next in 1996 in response to the 1991 recommendation and the most recent in 2007 in response to the 2001 recommendation. The 4 year course breakdown in all the LACS recommendations is roughly the same:

4 courses per semester
30-35% CS courses, 10% math, 5% science, and the rest, i.e. 50% or more courses on arts, humanities and social sciences.

A typical graduation requirement at a research university is at least 120 credits, which comes to 5 3-credit courses per semester. Many require more than 120 so 6 course semesters are not uncommon.

",wsaleem,https://academia.stackexchange.com/users/14572,"You are making several unfounded assumptions:


That courses are always 3 credits, so that ""4 courses per semester"" means 12 credits. I have taken courses that were worth 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 credits. Many of the science courses I've taken, including math and computer science courses, have been worth 4 credits. Basic sciences that involve a lecture, lab, and recitation have sometimes been 5 credits.
That most liberal arts colleges follow the LACS recommendations to the letter. 
That the LACS recommendations somehow suggest that less than 120 credits are required for graduation. Here is an example of a liberal arts college following the LACS recommendations for CS and requiring 120 credits. 


I did half of my undergraduate degree at a liberal arts college and then transferred to a large research university for the other half.

That courses are always 3 credits, so that ""4 courses per semester"" means 12 credits. I have taken courses that were worth 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 credits. Many of the science courses I've taken, including math and computer science courses, have been worth 4 credits. Basic sciences that involve a lecture, lab, and recitation have sometimes been 5 credits.
That most liberal arts colleges follow the LACS recommendations to the letter. 
That the LACS recommendations somehow suggest that less than 120 credits are required for graduation. Here is an example of a liberal arts college following the LACS recommendations for CS and requiring 120 credits. 


I did half of my undergraduate degree at a liberal arts college and then transferred to a large research university for the other half. There was virtually no difference in my courseload between the two - I took exactly one credit more in my two years in the research university. I just pulled up my transcripts, and this is what I took each semester:

3806,3806,6049,What are the benefits of owning a physical book?,"I have seen this question about updates of the D&amp;D 4th Edition books, and it got me thinking.
Since I got my Kindle I have not read a single paper novel; they have fewer drawbacks compared to digital copies than rpg rulebooks.


Dead-tree types have some benefits like looking good on a bookshelf, but any ebook reader weighs less with 100 novels than the usual hard-cover book. 
If you want to look for the damage of Ares Alpha, even with a half-decent tablet it takes less than 2 seconds.  
Digital copies do not get worn, they never get unwanted earmarks, but you can bookmark them.
Rulebooks do get updates, and unless you are willing to take a pen to your book, your hard copies will never contain them. The pdfs can be edited and resent to the buyers. 
Even better is the WotC approach with the DDI, you can look up any monster or item or (almost any) rule, in the most recent form, for 3 years at the cost of seven books. 


I think this is the way to go, even considering the horribly slow character builder. Although I must admit good illustration can help build the athmosphere.

So what am I missing? Why are people buying rpg rulebooks in paper format? Why are books even published, I do not need to know if feats are supposed to be on the right page and skills on the left, I just want a list of them, filterable any way I want. 

Is this just a necessary part of earning money? I understand that pdfs are copied illegally, but the Compendium is not. 
",András,https://rpg.stackexchange.com/users/9552,"The benefits for owning a book are the same reasons we still have books, and why people still buy books instead of a Kindle or PDFs.

The advantage of books comes down to something basic: interacting with them is different to interacting with e-readers, and in the better for a lot of ways.

Let's consider the case of a single user, with access to a single e-reader or several books.

A key concept: Books are transparent tools for reading. E-readers are not.

One major difference between books and e-readers is the concept of a transparent tool. A transparent tool is one you can use without having to consciously think about operating the tool in order to use it, because it gets out of your way when you use it - it's something you can forget you're even using.

An easy comparison to demonstrate the difference is between a pen, which is a transparent tool, and a keyboard, which is not.

When you pick up a pen to write, you're not consciously thinking of the individual actions of moving the pen up, down, left, across, or so on. You can simply write, and your motions transfer effortlessly through the pen to paper. By contrast, to use a keyboard to write, you have to consciously operate the keys on the keyboard, mindfully reaching for the right keys to produce the results you want. Advanced users will become more at ease with the keyboard, but it will never be quite as transparent a tool to use as a pen, which requires little conscious operation beyond our natural movements.

Books and e-readers share an analogous situation: the e-reader is less transparent than a book, though technical aptitude and being used to the tool can help. E-readers are getting better at being transparent tools, but they're not there yet.

Of course, this sets aside the difficulty of actually writing well and legibly, but when considering the transparency of the tool, how neat your writing ends up looking or how fast you write isn't so much of an issue: whether the tool you're operating gets out of your way is the issue.

What does this mean for books?

In general, books just do what they do exceptionally well, and they do it transparently.

E-readers might let you do some similar things to what you can do with a book, but their equivalents are limited. The e-reader's equivalent action may not be as simple and effortless as performing the same action with a book, and you, the person trying to read their book, may be restricted in how you can perform that action, such that you cannot do it in a way that better suits you.


When placing bookmarks in books, you can use the method that works well for you or comes naturally to you. You can put coloured (or named) tabs in them, dogflap the pages, and so on. There are a dozen ways to mark pages. Despite being something small, this is one of the major differences, since for some, the e-reader's equivalent bookmark feature just doesn't work as well as methods such as coloured tabs poking out of the pages.
Flipping to those bookmarks is a completely natural and effortless action. You put your finger in beside your bookmark and open the book.
Browsing a book is easy, fast and flexible.

You can leap variable amounts of pages at a time.
For a book you're used to, leaping to an entire section can be as easy as flipping to a bookmark. E-readers offer something similar (if they have a table of contents), but it is not equivalent: you can't easily jump to the middle of a section, or so on. Muscle memory plays a helpful role here that it can't play with an e-reader.
RPG manuals will often mark the very edge of pages, so that you can see the different sections whilst the book is still closed. That guides leaping between sections, and e-readers don't generally offer an equivalent yet.
You can easily thumb between pages, keeping your fingers in past ones to go back and forth.

You can open multiple books at the same time, and have then all visible in parallel, with little loss of ability to read or operate any individual book, given you simply have enough space to lay them out or prop them up.
You can pass a book to a friend at the table, without losing the ability to read your other books. (This is hugely relevant to games like D&amp;D, where the GM can have their book open, and each of the players can have a book open with content pertinent to them. The cases may be equal when everyone at the table has an e-reader, though I'm not sure this is common.)
You can mark books: annotate them, write, draw, highlight, and so on. You can also leave post-its and other things in them. You can do similar things in e-readers, but they offer far more limited options, depending on the e-reader.
Books don't run out of batteries or need a cable.


... and a lot more.

You can do a lot of these things given the right e-reader, and e-readers are getting better at making these things easier to do. But e-readers won't let you do all of them, nor do it as easily.

Plus, books can be nicer for other reasons.

In some cases, the electronic version might be missing content.


In D&amp;D 4e, the Compendium offers no lore at all. The compendium will tell you almost nothing about how the Elemental Chaos and Astral Sea came to be, how the World was formed, the Dawn War that was fought, and the present states of the planes.
D&amp;D 3.5e's SRD contains very little lore, some names are different, and entire swathes of books are simply not released.


There's also the fact that some people just prefer books. The emotional factor isn't without relevance: to some such as myself, there's something pleasant about being able to pick up a hefty tome.

E-Readers offer little in comparison.

E-readers can give you one device instead of several heavy books, and offer some features that books don't - you can't ctrl+F a book - but it comes with trade-offs in ease of use in virtually every department.

E-readers are just... not yet as easy to interact with as books are.

1155,1155,1814,How to store length of time in a model with Rails?,"I can think of two solutions:

1) Store hours, minutes, seconds, etc. in separate columns in the database


Downside: a lot of columns


2) Convert and store the number of seconds


We still want to be able to show seperate fields for hour, minute, second, etc. in the form. We could write virtual attribute for each of these and write a before_save callback that converts the timespan to seconds (still messy tho).


Am I missing some other obvious solution? How do you people do this?

2. Commentary

As far as I can see, there are really only two things that you are trying to achieve:


To create the mixed fraction a b/c from the string ""a b/c"". But instead of implementing a whole new class, why not just write a function to parse the string and return a Fraction?

import re
from fractions import Fraction

_MIXED_FORMAT = re.compile(r""""""
    \A\s*                      # optional whitespace at the start, then
    (?P&lt;sign&gt;[-+]?)            # an optional sign, then
    (?P&lt;whole&gt;\d+)             # integer part
    \s+                        # whitespace
    (?P&lt;num&gt;\d+)               # numerator
    /(?P&lt;denom&gt;\d+)            # denominator
    \s*\Z                      # and optional whitespace to finish
"""""", re.VERBOSE)

def mixed(s):
    """"""Parse the string s as a (possibly mixed) fraction.

        &gt;&gt;&gt; mixed('-0  12/15')
        Fraction(-4, 5)
        &gt;&gt;&gt; mixed('+45/15')
        Fraction(3, 1)

    """"""
    m = _MIXED_FORMAT.match(s)
    if not m:
        return Fraction(s)
    d = m.groupdict()
    result = int(d['whole']) + Fraction(int(d['num']), int(d['denom']))
    if d['sign'] == '-':
        return -result
    else:
        return result

To format a fraction in mixed notation. But why not just write this as a function:

def format_mixed(f):
    """"""Format the fraction f as a (possibly) mixed fraction.

        &gt;&gt;&gt; all(format_mixed(mixed(f)) == f for f in ['1 2/3', '-3 4/5', '7/8'])
        True

    """"""
    if abs(f) &lt;= 1 or f.denominator == 1:
        return str(f)
    return '{0} {1.numerator}/{1.denominator}'.format(int(f), abs(f - int(f)))



The rest of your code seems unnecessary and complicated.

2. Commentary

As far as I can see, there are really only two things that you are trying to achieve:


To create the mixed fraction a b/c from the string ""a b/c"". But instead of implementing a whole new class, why not just write a function to parse the string and return a Fraction?

import re
from fractions import Fraction

_MIXED_FORMAT = re.compile(r""""""

    (?P&lt;sign&gt;[-+]?)            # an optional sign, then
    (?P&lt;whole&gt;\d+)             # integer part
    \s+                        # whitespace
    (?P&lt;num&gt;\d+)               # numerator
    /(?P&lt;denom&gt;\d+)            # denominator
    \s*\Z                      # and optional whitespace to finish
"""""", re.VERBOSE)

def mixed(s):
    """"""Parse the string s as a (possibly mixed) fraction.

        Fraction(-5, 3)
        &gt;&gt;&gt; mixed('-0  12/15')
        Fraction(-4, 5)
        &gt;&gt;&gt; mixed('+45/15')
        Fraction(3, 1)

    """"""
    m = _MIXED_FORMAT.match(s)
    if not m:
        return Fraction(s)
    d = m.groupdict()
    result = int(d['whole']) + Fraction(int(d['num']), int(d['denom']))
    if d['sign'] == '-':
        return -result
    else:
        return result

To format a fraction in mixed notation. But why not just write this as a function:

def format_mixed(f):
    """"""Format the fraction f as a (possibly) mixed fraction.

        &gt;&gt;&gt; all(format_mixed(mixed(f)) == f for f in ['1 2/3', '-3 4/5', '7/8'])
        True

    """"""
    if abs(f) &lt;= 1 or f.denominator == 1:
        return str(f)
    return '{0} {1.numerator}/{1.denominator}'.format(int(f), abs(f - int(f)))



The rest of your code seems unnecessary and complicated.

1811,1811,2874,How can I speed up the rate at which putty dries?,"We're (slowly) renovating the sash windows in our house and the current window is causing problems. What should have been a quick job (especially at this time of year!) has turned into a marathon because the putty won't dry.

We had to replace a couple of panes of glass (one was cracked and we broke another when using a heat gun to remove the paint) so we knew it would take a little while. On a previous window the putty took over three weeks to dry enough to paint partly because (as we thought) there was too much oil. So this time we rolled the putty on newspaper first to try to remove the excess oil. It seemed to work, but after two weeks the putty is still soft to the touch.

We've tried standing the windows next to a radiator but all that seemed to do was make it softer (which was obviously going to happen in hindsight).

So given that we don't want to reputty the windows what can we do to speed up the drying process.

We've had to seal off the room and cover the window as best we can in the meantime.

I've found this advice on DoItYourself.com which doesn't really help as it says use other materials!

2467,2467,3934,Should FPS exceed ticks/second?,"I was once told that you should never re-draw a frame if the game logic has not changed since the last draw. 

Assuming game logic is updated once every tick, and assuming a game runs at 40 FPS @ 20 ticks/second, does that mean that every two consecutive frames will be exactly the same? If so, is there any visual difference between a game running at 40 FPS @ 20 ticks/second versus a game running at 20 FPS @ 20 ticks/second?

Perhaps I don't understand game loops that well, but it seems to me that ticks/second is a limiting factor of FPS.
",mario_sunny,https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/users/41586,"Your engine and your game must be super flexible to allow the possibility of drawing two times with no state change.
A usual game loop ties very closely all updates in a sequential fashion.
One thread, one loop, one point to flush events, one point to execute processing updates (entity/component processors, or simply manager's updates), and finally one render call which triggers the whole engine 1-frame render.  

Whole engine 1 frame render can be made in two fashions, extrospective (intrusive), by accessing (with visitors) the state of the drwable objects of the game, and create the rendering states, passes and commands that go with it.

Or it could be fully retained, and the state of the engine was set BY the processors during the logic update, and it holds sufficient information per se to draw a frame in isolation.

This is a classical game loop. It uses a delta_time variable that is given to all managers during update.

If you have a physical manager, usually there is another loop within the Update itself, that will use a fixed dt and iterate as many time to fill the lagging-time to reach delta_time. And store the remainder for the next frame's refresh, to execute as part of the first loop next time.

Now, its possible to have a more advanced game loop by separating event treatments, by using a thread specific system event queue, preparing a pool of timestamped events, and when the main thread is in the event treatment update, it pulls this queue.

Its hardly possible to completely asychronize managers updates and frame rendering. Many engine state updates are not atomic. Even a fully retained engine will have limitations. DirectX11 introduces isolated command lists (deferred devices, in their parlance), which can help to design such an engine. But if you have such basic doubts about your own render loop, I suppose you don't use such things, yet.

Since you are in java, and you talk about ticks, I imagine you must have plugged your refresh function to a periodic timer. Of course this is sub-par as a game loop design, even from the most basic loop design described above. This is not how real time systems are designed, doing this, you rely on a framework, that depends on operating system native kernel tick rate, and java's virtual machine to relay you the wakening events (and scheduling) to fire up your frame routine. This will incur bad sampling rates (aliasing) and randomness from various sources. You will have to suffer from potentially long sleep times that are not controlled, in the thread ready queue, or kernel timer tick rounding issues. This will all misalign with your framerate presentation, and result in stutterings, and if the event queue is not fully depleted at each refresh, you will also have input lag, and potentially, building up with time. Worse, since you are event based, your events I fear, are consumed by event treatment, therefore your processing time will vary according to input, and delay your frame rendering. Potentially totally masking it out. This is like a security flaw, lots of input could overflow the game and make it unresponsive.

Event based systems are not made for real time applications, they are made for basically idling applications.

Now, back to your question, it should not be a problem to fraw at 40FPS when your game updates at 20. Also be careful, in a timer based system, 20 FPS = 50ms, it will likely round up to 60ms (4*15 ; 15=typical kernel), therefore you'll get 16FPS. Use some precise chronometers to display frame update time on screen, and another one to display display rate. (use a counter around the Present call. Or framebuffer Swap (OpenGL term), or simply install Fraps.)

This will give you some statistics.

The people advocating that high display rates are bad probably refer to useless loss of resource, resulting in machine heating up, or the useless frame taking time to finish, the GPU is not ready to render the next frame when its ready, that is to say, likely right in the middle of the useless redraw. Which is why, no redraw = better responsiveness, leaving the GPU available right away when the next frame is ready.

Also tearing, is an argument often heard. Tearing is caused by swappings (presentations) frequencies that are non multiples of the screen frequency. the VSynch is the feature that helps that, by using hardware support, the VGA/DVI/HDMI cable transports a tick signal that says ""I flipped!"", the graphic cards receives it, signal it to the CPU with an interrupt (most likely), and the driver gets it and communicate it to the currently waiting OpenGL/DirectX presenting threads. This unleash a fast back-to-front copy, which executes in much less that the 60Hz timeframe, and then when the screen next flips, a full image is presented, this avoids perfectly the tearing.

The best is to respect this presentation rate, it is a tempo given by hardware, and the whole game/engine thread is put to sleep by the graphics API itself inside of the Swap/Present call, which allows to rest the CPU, allowing it to cool down, and allows perfect frame/game synchronization if using a linear loop like mentioned above.

Provided your game can update faster than 60Hz. Otherwise, it will fallback immediately to 30Fps naturally, then 20, then 15, by plateaus. This is a natural response.

Tearing is caused by swappings (presentations) frequencies that are non multiples of the screen frequency. the VSynch is the feature that helps that, by using hardware support, the VGA/DVI/HDMI cable transports a tick signal that says ""I flipped!"", the graphic cards receives it, signal it to the CPU with an interrupt (most likely), and the driver gets it and communicate it to the currently waiting OpenGL/DirectX presenting threads. This unleash a fast back-to-front copy, which executes in much less that the 60Hz timeframe, and then when the screen next flips, a full image is presented, this avoids perfectly the tearing.

The best is to respect this presentation rate, it is a tempo given by hardware, and the whole game/engine thread is put to sleep by the graphics API itself inside of the Swap/Present call, which allows to rest the CPU, allowing it to cool down, and allows perfect frame/game synchronization if using a linear loop like mentioned above.

Provided your game can update faster than 60Hz. Otherwise, it will fallback immediately to 30Fps naturally, then 20, then 15, by plateaus. This is a natural response.

4635,4635,7352,"What is the Goal of ""Hot Network Questions""?","There has been a tug-of-war in the hot-questions list.

Community members like JonW seem to be unhappy with the traffic that it brings to their site:


  'But we want to encourage people to post, that's the whole point of the HQ list!' I hear you cry. I disagree. We want to encourage people to the site not just to that question.


The SE Community Team seems to have a different opinion as Shog9 points out (emphasis mine):


  the results have been... Not great so far: a significantly smaller number of people are clicking through to randomly-selected questions than to the top questions, which hints that the algorithm may've been doing a better job of identifying general-interest questions across topics than some expected.


Disclaimer: This should not be taken as a slight of the community team whatsoever, nor do I think this is some cause for revolt or a boxing match as the below prose may indicate. These are just poorly applied literary tools to emphasize the drastically different approaches to the same list between two groups.

In the Red Corner, the Community Members

The goal of the hot questions should be to drive up interest in the site. The hot questions should be a lure to encourage SE network users to contribute to other content, not just do a drive-by on the hot question.

In the Blue Corner, the Community Team

The goal of the hot questions should be to drive traffic to general-interest questions. After all, the Hot Network Questions used to be more accurately named as ""Popular Questions"".

What is the Goal of Advertising Network Questions?

Before discussing how to calculate hotness, or how the list should be ordered, we need to come to an agreement on what the heck we are actually trying to achieve. Once we know what we are looking to accomplish, we can find the best way to do that.

The list of questions from a variety of sites is in a great location screen-wise, it is readily accessible and does get a lot of eyes on it. But as with any marketing, the goal isn't just to grab eyes, it's to grab the right eyes.*

* I have nothing against left eyes. Most of my friends have left eyes too. And they are awesome. But in the context right eyes are not a geospatial thing, but rather in the 'correct' sense.

So what are the right eyes? What type of people do we want to attract to our site? What would we determine as 'success'? How can we measure that success?

Please do not limit yourself to the very narrowly scoped topic above. Think outside the box if you'd like. On every page across the network we have a nice piece of real estate for showing off the rest of the network. How can that space best be used if not on a list of questions picked by an arbitrary algorithm?
",jmac,https://meta.stackexchange.com/users/209637,"The ideal hot questions list would present the best posts of the network that are of interest to a wider population than only experts on that subject. The hot questions are shown to a much broader audience than the source site alone, showing them very specialized posts that they won't understand is not really useful.

I think drawing some attention to the larger SE network is one important role of the hot questions list, but I don't see recruitment of new users as its main purpose. It raises awareness of other sites that the users might not have noticed otherwise, and ideally it showcases some good content, and that might lead to some users staying on the site. But the whole mechanism is not targeted enough to be very effective in that regard, the hot questions list is shown to a large population where only a tiny part is likely an expert in the subject of one specific site. I think the best ways to recruit new users need to be targeted, e.g. recommendation from a colleague or a link to the site in a place frequented by experts on that topic.

The hot questions list becomes problematic when it identifies questions that are popular, but are not really of a high quality. When the algorithm identifies a question where the community of the source sites thinks the content is not very good and maybe even a bit embarrassing for the site, there is a problem. The questions should have popular appeal, but they should still be something even experts are not embarrassed to have as a showcase for their site. Often an excellent answer alone can raise a mediocre questions to something that deserves a place in the hot questions list.

So what the algorithm should identify are questions (and their answers) that are considered good by the source community, and of interest to a much broader audience.

""What age are you?"" is definitely not idiomatic.  Using it would mark you instantly as a non-native speaker.  However, it makes logical sense and it would be understood.

""How age is it?"" would be even worse.  While most native speakers could likely figure out what this meant, it sounds simply wrong.

If you were asking a person about his or her age, you'd almost always say ""How old are you?"" or ""What year were you born?"" or ""When you were born?"" -- with the first one being by far the most common.

If you were asking about an object, you would usually say ""How old is it?""  But you might also say ""When was it built?"" (in reference to a building or structure) or ""How long has it been here?"" or ""How many years has it been here?"" or ""How long has it been around?"" -- again, the simple ""How old is it?"" would be most common.

2070,2070,3299,"How do indirect, session-specific resource tokens increase security?","The OWASP web site recommends this:


Use per user or session indirect object references. This prevents attackers from directly targeting unauthorized resources. For example, instead of using the resource’s database key, a drop down list of six resources authorized for the current user could use the numbers 1 to 6 to indicate which value the user selected. [italics mine]
Check access. Each use of a direct object reference from an untrusted source must include an access control check to ensure the user is authorized for the requested object. [italics mine]


So if a user doesn't have access to the requested resource, how does obfuscating the direct object reference improve security?

Given the increased complexity that, say, an ASP.NET MVC site would accrue, is this worth the additional trouble for anything but banking sites?
",Robert Harvey,https://security.stackexchange.com/users/2709,"I will explain this by giving an example:

Suggest you have a list of objects in your database named:


Pear
Apple
Orange


You have a query which fills up a hash table stored in your session which maps the fruits you are authorized to have to a number:


1 => Pear
2 => Apple


You do not have access  to Orange. You then have a function which allows you to add fruits to a basket, so you choose a number 1 or 2 (this is the indirect object reference). Orange is not accessible in this session as it's not present in the hashtable (there is no number 3). With direct object reference you would have a function which just uses Apple, Pear, Orange rather than a number. So you could abuse the function (if no access controls are used) to add the Orange to your basket as well.

I personally do not see issues with direct object reference IF adequate access controls are in place. These access controls should be tested extensively. There might be more critical applications than others where this might be required, but imagine applications where there are thousands of users with each 100 or 1.000 options unique to them. Storing all of these in a session could have a significant impact on performance (considering the server will need to store this information for each client on the webserver).

5781,5781,9161,Is research a viable business model?,"I have had the suspicion that it may be for a while and apparently not all is a product of my mind. Let me quote from an answer:


  In my experience, in UK and other European countries, the research
  funding comes from successful proposals to the relevant funding
  bodies. There are research centres that were established and keep
  going only because the staff there constantly submits project
  proposals (somebody told me that the success rate is 1 out of 5 or
  maybe even lower).


There are two questions here.


Can a company feasibly focus on obtaining funds in publicly funded research (as a business model) successfully enough to ""survive""?
Can such a company be started (nearly) from scratch?


In short, the company would be exactly like a research institute (or institution) except that it would be private.

Reasons why question 1 may not be feasible:


I don't see any company doing this kind of thing, i.e. there may be some, but there are not many, which means that it may be hard. It's a bad sign.
Public funds seem to be assigned to public entities, while companies can benefit from the collaboration and synergy, but they are expected to get their funding from their work as companies (searching for customers, etc.) In this case the customers would be the partners in the projects and the society itself, but again, this seems to be an ""innovative"" (maybe naïve, or even plain stupid) idea.
Research is a means for something, not an end on itself, that's why the business model should be on something else (point two) and that's why such a company would raise eyebrows on the mere idea of its existence. It may even be against some kind of tacit rule or even written laws.


Reasons why question 2 may not be feasible:


No previous history of success of the company, or products or anything means zero (or negative) trustworthiness and no projects assigned to the company.
No partners would like to associate with the company in a project for the reasons in point 1.
The most similar case I can think of are spin-off companies that are created from successful research labs, not from scratch.
OMG so much communism! Go to kickstarter you hippie!


As an example, a possible scenario that could be close to this: Someone writes a paper about a software system that does something not very novel in the state of the art but in a way that is very different from an architectural point of view, leading to good results in practical terms. In short: in theory nothing is new, in practice what was just a dream is now a reality. What is done remains the same in theory, but how it is done is completely different in practice (and now it works). Unfortunately only a proof of concept (PoC) can reasonably be implemented.

Would it be feasible to request funds to continue the development of this PoC (still very far from a commercial product) as a start-up or that simply doesn't make sense?

1619,1619,2539,How is encapsulation used for safety?,"I am learning OOP. I have studied much about encapsulation but the more I read the more I became confused.

I understand we hide (by making private) data and expose it to user of class (other developers) as properties or methods. I also understand by encapsulation we hide details.

In an article (http://www.csharp-station.com/Tutorial/CSharp/lesson19) I read:

Abstract from article

When designing an object, you must think about how others could use it. In a best-case scenario any program using the object would be well designed and the code would never change. However, the reality is that programs do change often and in a team environment many people touch the same code at one time or another. Therefore, it is beneficial to consider what could go wrong as well as the pristine image of how the object should be used.

In the case of the BankAccount object, examine the situation where code outside of your object could access a decimal Amount field or a string CustomerName field. At the point of time that the code is written, everything would work well. However, later in the development cycle, you realize that the BankAccount object should keep track of an int CustomerID rather than string CustomerName because you don't want to duplicate relationships between information (or some other valid reason to alter the definition of internal state). Such changes cause a rippling effect in your code because it was built to use the BankAccount class, as originally designed (with CustomerName being a string), and you must now change code that accesses that state throughout your entire application.

The object-oriented principle of Encapsulation helps avoid such problems, allowing you to hide internal state and abstract access to it though type members such as methods, properties, and indexers. Encapsulation helps you reduce coupling between objects and increases the maintainability of your code. 

Question
How will encapsulation help when making changes in code and from its rippling effects.
For a data member, if I change its type from int to float, (even if I am exposing this using property) I will need to change variable type where I am using already using this code.

Kindly guide me how encapsulation will help with such changes.

Thanks for this help and guidance.

6009,6009,9530,Why don't banks give access to all your transaction activity?,"In the era of big data, I find it surprising that banks and credit card companies only offer access to a ridiculously small number of transactions - often only your last 180 days, if that. The longest I've seen was 720 days going back. I suspect they do store everything, but intentionally limit access.

These transactions are text only, take up extremely little space, and storing an individual's lifetime worth of transaction would take less than 10MB of data; about the storage required by two MP3 files, and about 250k records per person per lifetime, if we generously assume everyone makes 10 transactions a day. But I'd be happy with only the last 10 years of transactions, so about 1MB per customer. One of the largest banks, JP Morgan Chase, has ~70MM credit card customers. That means 70TB of data for 10 years of records - hardly impressive for a corporation of that size, with $17B of net income in 2013, when 1TB of cloud storage costs $10 retail per month.

By comparison, would you put up with Gmail or any online email provider keeping only the most recent 120 days worth of email? (And emails do take a lot more space than transactions, are far more numerous, and have to be instantly retrievable.)

Storage requirements for transaction activity are trivial in an era where we're throwing around petabytes and zetabytes.

They are not different.

They are the same thing. There is only one real law which is the head to tail rule. When adding any number vectors put head to tail, head to tail, head to tail... until all the vectors are used up and then draw a line from the tail to the head and that is your resultant vector.

The parallelogram law is essentially just using the triangle law twice in a different order, and they both get the same answer because order does not matter I.E. $\vec A+ \vec B = \vec B + \vec A$.

Here shows the addition of three vectors, the ""triangle"" rule has been used twice in a row to get $\vec A+ \vec B + \vec C = \vec R$. If yo tried to use the parallelogram to get this answer the resulting diagram would be a mess of repeatedly writing the same vector and over.

They are the same thing. There is only one real law which is the head to tail rule. When adding any number vectors put head to tail, head to tail, head to tail... until all the vectors are used up and then draw a line from the tail to the head and that is your resultant vector.

The parallelogram law is essentially just using the triangle law twice in a different order, and they both get the same answer because order does not matter I.E. $\vec A+ \vec B = \vec B + \vec A$.

Here shows the addition of three vectors, the ""triangle"" rule has been used twice in a row to get $\vec A+ \vec B + \vec C = \vec R$. If yo tried to use the parallelogram to get this answer the resulting diagram would be a mess of repeatedly writing the same vector and over.

507,507,790,What is Cold Iron actually?,"It came up in Dresden Files, but is not limited to that game, you can find the term in DnD as well. I would like to know what it means. 

If you look for Cold Iron on Wikipedia, you only get iron: 
""Cold iron is a poetic and archaic term for iron.""
This would imply everything made mostly from Fe is cold iron. Clearly, this is not the case, in every game Cold Iron is something special, the every day sword is not made out of it. 

The Dresden Files rulebook is not very specific about it:


  something that anyone could reasonably get access to, but usually doesn’t carry on them (like cold iron) page 185.


What is cold iron?
How do I create cold iron?
How do I get cold iron?   

To make the question easier to understand, compare Cold Iron to Holy Water. You know how it is different from usual Water, you know how you get it or create it. 
",András,https://rpg.stackexchange.com/users/9552,"“Cold iron” historically is just a poetic way of saying “iron.” Worked iron (including steel) is traditionally something that the fairy folk shy away from, and many fantasy works have embraced this—but each does it their own way.

The Dresden Files universe is a very practical and down-to-earth place when it comes to magical reagents. In a world where magic is about faith and effort, where ritual is just a convenient way to focus one's will, you don't have to do anything in particular to make iron nasty for the fey. Iron and fairies just don't mix: pretty much any iron/steel will make the fey folk unhappy. (By contrast D&amp;D 3.5 says cold iron is special stuff, defined both by where it’s mined and how it’s forged. We could speculate about whether that's more due to flavour or balance, but I digress.)

The very presence of iron in any form is uncomfortable for Dresden Files fey, and bringing steel into a fey demesne is profane, but most people don’t casually carry enough iron to be a convenient weapon against the fey. Wounds inflicted on fairies by iron weapons—including nails, boxcutters, and steel-jacketed bullets—are slow to heal, and are spiritual as well as physical. You could also try hitting one with your car, or using a staple gun--neither of which are designed for precision violence.

If this seems imbalanced, well. It is. DFRPG is more narratively balanced than it is mechanically. Since fey find iron so offensive, they go on the offensive when confronted with it. Possessing an iron weapon has major drawbacks in a fey-heavy campaign, because it makes you a target for suspicion and possibly pre-emptive elimination. But--remember that your average handgun bullets don't have steel jackets.

…the fairies are very glad we’re using so much more plastic these days.

(There is also a real-world forging technique called “cold forging.” It means the metal wasn’t heated as much as many techniques call for, and the resulting piece has different qualities of hardness than a hot-forged piece.

2607,2607,4149,Why does resizing PNG with alpha transparency make edges gray?,"I'm using PSP 7 (I know it's old, but it serves my purposes).

I am resizing a bunch of images. PNG images with alpha transparency load with black backgrounds when I first open them. I have little experience with masks. I learned that I can do Masks > Load From Alpha Channel to see the transparent areas.

After loading the alpha channel, I resize the image. Usually, this works fine. However, sometimes the edges look a bit gray - kind of like if I made a transparent GIF on a gray background.

For the record, the box for Resize all layers is checked. If I uncheck that, the edges are black after resize. Also, the original images are already PNG-24 (16 million colors).

Here is the original viewed at 8x zoom (scaled in the browser to fit):



And here it is after reszing viewed at 8x zoom:



And here is the resized image viewed at 1x zoom:



It's probably not that noticeable to a lot of people, but the top edge does not look smooth to me.

Is there an easy way to fix this? Do I need to resize the mask separately?

The last one I had like this was a white circle. So I just cropped out the edges and added a white circle behind it. This one is a little harder.

3166,3166,5041,When to use a runabout or a shuttle in a mission?,"In TNG and DS9, we often see the use of shuttles and runabouts. What is the deciding factor of which one to use? How come we only see one use of a runabout in TNG? Is it only about the crew size on board? Yet shuttles have been shown to carry quite a number of people too? Is it speed?
",The Byzantine,https://scifi.stackexchange.com/users/9382,"The difference between a runabout and a shuttlecraft is a matter of size and capability. Most of the time, their duties were interchangeable so either ship could be used. With the ability to customize ships in the Federation, there are numerous designs for shuttlecraft which includes vehicles such as the Delta Flyer (VOY) or the Captain's Yacht, Cousteau (TNG).


Shuttlecraft were small ships assigned to starships, used primarily in cargo transportation, short trips for species which experience transporter difficulties or anxiety, or movement through electromagnetic phenomenon which might disrupt or challenge transporter technologies. 
Shuttlecraft had to be fit during the TOS period with technologies to allow them to be used with warp drives. By the TNG series, shuttlecraft came standard with relatively short-hop warp capacities (some light years allowing them to be used as exploration vehicles). There were many different classes of shuttlecraft depending on the duties being carried out.
Runabouts were slightly larger than shuttlecraft but smaller than starships. Runabouts were warp-capable, had personal transporters and usually had a crew of four personnel. Properly fitted, they could function as transports, scientific vehicles or medical evacuation vehicles. Runabouts were used primarily on space stations such as Deep Space Nine (DS9) as a means of travel between the Federation, Cardassian and Bajoran sectors of space.




Runabout specifications included deflectors and phaser arrays. But they were not meant to sustain much damage, despite the fact they could be used in combat.

3740,3740,5957,Structure for nitrate ion?,"

Why is the above structure not considered a valid structure for the nitrate ion? Is it because adding a double bond reduces the formal charges present on the nitrogen? Does the above form exist anywhere?
",1110101001,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/users/2142,"Nitrate actually exists as a superposition of these three resonance forms:



Essentially, a lone pair from an oxygen with a negative formal change forms a double bond to nitrogen. However, as nitrogen is a period II element, and hence must obey the octet rule, it can not have 5 bonds to other atoms. The already-present double bond then turns into a single bond and the pair of electrons moves onto the oxygen. This ""movement"" can happen with all three of the oxygen atoms and all three of the bonds. This is called ""resonance"".

Due to resonance, the energy of the system is minimised making it more stable.

Your Lewis structure is not far off. The ""true"" structure of nitrate is:



Approximately, each oxygen atom contributes one third of a bond with the nitrogen, lowering the formal charge on each atom from what you have written, which does not exist in nature.

The true structure is sort of an average of the properties of each possibility for where the electrons could be located, including the three resonance forms above, your structure, and any other configuration. However, these other forms are of minuscule probability to be formed (perhaps read up on wavefunctions and electron distributions if you're interested), and so the main contributors to the ""real"" structure are the three resonance forms.

It seems using a local mailserver to use as a relay is a common solution. But how does one log or track whether or not email was delivered correctly by using this method?

I'm interested in their theology, history, and influence on Christianity in their day, and whether or not their influence continues to today.  
",David Stratton,https://christianity.stackexchange.com/users/721,"The “Zwickau prophets,” i.e., Nicholas Storch, Thomas Drechsel, and Mark Stübner, etc., claimed to be prophets of God and to have received revelations directly from God.  They were leading an anti-Protestant, anti-Catholic, spiritualistic attempt at communism and anarchy based on a view of taking the millennium by force as prophets. Thomas Münzer (1490–1525) was a radical figure in the Reformation who became a leader in the Peasants’ Revolt of 1524–1525. From this man we get a clear window into all of his associates:


  Thomas Muenzer, one of the Zwickau Prophets, and an eloquent demagogue, was the apostle and travelling evangelist of the social revolution, and a forerunner of modern socialism, communism, and anarchism. He presents a remarkable compound of the discordant elements of radicalism and mysticism. (HISTORY OF THE CHRISTIAN CHURCH, PHILIP SCHAFF (Vol 7, Ch4, P75)


He started by being influenced by doctrines of the reformation but quickly became an extremist who was deposed from his church. He hated Luther even worse then the Pope even though before his ‘fall’ he was actually selected by Luther to become a Lutheran pastor in the city of Zwickau.


  He was at enmity with the whole existing order of society, and imagined himself the divinely inspired prophet of a new dispensation, a sort of communistic millennium, in which there should be no priests, no princes, no nobles, and no private property, but complete democratic equality. He inflamed the people in fiery harangues from the pulpit, and in printed tracts to open rebellion against their spiritual and secular rulers. He signed himself “Muenzer with the hammer,” and “with the sword of Gideon.” He advised the killing of all the ungodly. They had no right to live. Christ brought the sword, not peace upon earth. “Look not,” he said, “on the sorrow of the ungodly; let not your sword grow cold from blood; strike hard upon the anvil of Nimrod [the princes]; cast his tower to the ground, because the day is yours.” (HISTORY OF THE CHRISTIAN CHURCH, PHILIP SCHAFF (Vol 7, Ch4, P75)


Although it might not seem that these prophets had any influence on the Christian world, Karl Marx did refer to Thomas Münzer in his own writings, so you could say they had an impact on the world's continued opposition to the church. The beliefs of the Zwickau Prophets goes back to a pre-reformation sect in Bohemia who held a, ‘Taborite creed’. Tabor was a city in Bohemia that held control of local gold mines, the citizens joined local peasants to develop a communist-like society.  The key to their quasi-religious communits movement was in their view of the millennial reign of Christ. Taborites lived announced in the millennium there would be no more servants and masters. They promised people would return to a state of pristine innocence.


  Zwickau, however, was near the Bohemian border, and there Müntzer was converted by the weaver and adept Niklas Storch, who had lived in Bohemia, to the old Taborite creed: in particular, continuing personal divine revelation to the prophet of the cult, and the necessity for the Elect to seize power and impose a society of theocratic communism by brutal force of arms. In addition, there was to be communism of women: marriage was to be prohibited, and each man was to be able to have any woman at will.
  Thomas Müntzer now claimed to be the divinely chosen prophet, destined to wage a war of blood and extermination by the Elect against the sinners. Müntzer claimed that the ""living Christ"" had permanently entered his own soul. Endowed thereby with perfect insight into the divine will, he asserted himself to be uniquely qualified to fulfill the divine mission. He even spoke of himself as ""becoming God."" Having graduated from the world of learning, Müntzer was now ready for the world of action. (Karl Marx as Religious Eschatologist, Mises Daily: Friday, October 09, 2009 by Murray N. Rothbard)


Although the influence on communism can be traced, there does not seem to be any lasting influence on Christianity. There is a link between the Bohemian movements and a Christian movement called the Hussites under a Czech reformer Jan Hus (c. 1369–1415) and there are some modern churches who think of themselves to be related to those movements, in particular the Moravian Church, Unity of the Brethren, and the refounded Czechoslovak Hussite churches. However these churches do not resemble the ideas of Thomas Müntzer at all so it seems the lasting impact is more related to the communistic side of things only.

5090,5090,8097,Why can syn-periplanar E2 elimination happen in molecules like vinyl bromides but seemingly not in other molecules?,"E2 eliminations occur when the leaving group and the proton are in the anti-periplanar conformation not syn-periplanar. This is beyond a merely a preference as leads to E2 reactions being stereoselective. However, when it comes to vinyl bromides for example (involving a double bond) the reaction can occur in the Z- and E- isomers (i.e both syn-periplanar and anti-periplanar). How can this be the case? 
",RobChem,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/users/6925,"Elimination from vinyl halides occurs faster when the halide and proton have a trans relationship.  When the halide and proton are located on the same side of the double bond (cis), the elimination to form an alkyne is much slower.  The faster elimination from the trans arrangement is consistent with a preferred anti-periplanar arrangement in the E2 reaction.  

The fact that elimination still occurs, albeit at a slower rate, when the groups being eliminated are arranged cis to one another suggests that a different mechanism is involved in the ""cis"" case.  Two possible mechanistic alternatives are


cis elimination from a higher energy (higher energy, therefore less preferred, slower) syn-periplanar conformation, or
an E1CB mechanism where the proton is removed in a first step and a carbanion is generated, and this is followed by halide ejection in a second step.

141,141,224,What lightweight telephoto lens are available for Nikon bodies?,"I'm looking for a lightweight telephoto lens for my Nikon D700 body, with a focal length around 300mm, good sharpness and AF. After several days with the 70-200 vrII handheld, I found this lens too big and heavy. I usually prefer the prime lenses, but all the good ~300mm prime I know weight 1.5kg or more.

I will use it mostly for sport, wildlife and landscape. A bonus point if it is bright enough for a use in dark concert stages :)

The only two lightweight options I considered for now are


Nikon 70-300mm VR (750g, F5.6@300mm)
Nikon 180mm (760g) + 1.4x TC (F4@250mm)


Have you any recommandation on these possibilities ? e.g. with third party lenses.

What is left is for you to consider the total weight of your system instead. Maybe you can replace more than one lens with a longer zoom ratio one. Quality is not top-notch but still can be good enough given the constraints. Something like the Nikkor AF-S 28-300mm F/3.5-5.6 ED VR maybe.

I know I can prove when a document was last modified with cryptographic timestamping.  Is it possible to prove a document was or was not encrypted/decrypted in a given time period?

",Michael,https://crypto.stackexchange.com/users/4311,"It is possible for Bob and Alice to store many files on some host file server using a host-proof protocol -- i.e., in such a way that even the sysadmins of that server cannot decrypt and read the plaintext of those files.
You may be interested in browsing the questions with the host-proof tag.

As far as I know, there is only one way to prove that those sysadmins definitely have not read the plaintext of those files:


Never send the plaintext of those files directly to the host. Bob always encrypts each file before he sends it to the host.
Never send the file decryption key to the host. (Except perhaps in encrypted form, encrypted by some other key that is never sent in plaintext to the host server).


One way to do that is for Bob to generate encrypted files in OpenPGP format, and send those encrypted files to the host server.
(At the time of encryption, Bob uses his own public key and Alice's public key, in order to generate a file that can only be decrypted using either his own corresponding private key, or Alice's corresponding private key).
OpenPGP includes a message authentication code that can be used to prove that the sysadmins definitely have not modified the files, or replaced them entirely with files they created.

1814,1814,2878,SQL Agent powershell context reference,"At my new job, we have multiple named instances on each servers. 


Server1\Dev 
Server1\DevIntegrated 
Server1\QA


I have a SQL PowerShell script in the works that calls out to the OS, invokes Foo.exe but needs to pass a command line parameter (the connection string). A SQL Agent job will exist on each instance, with a step of type PowerShell, that needs to know what the current context is. i.e. This execution began on DevIntegrated. 

I have no desire to have every script start with 

$thisInstance = ""Dev""


eespecially as I'd have to edit that as we migrate to environments (new servers and named instances) in the upcoming months.   

If I start SQLPS, I can determine my instance by slicing and dicing the results of Get-Location or running

(Invoke-Sqlcmd -Query ""SELECT @@servername AS ServerName"" -SuppressProviderContextWarning).ServerName


When the SQL Agent starts a job of type PowerShell, it starts in the C:\windows\system32 The Get-Location route doesn't work as it's not in the SQLSERVER context. I can change into that context but I'll be at the ""root"" of SQL Server and won't know what instance I should be in. Using the Invoke-Sqlcmd route won't work either for same reason (technically, it times out as there is no default instance)

To the best of my knowledge, I've enumerated all the basic ""things"" I can Get into the job log but nothing seems to show SQLSERVER:\SQL\Server1\DevIntegrated


Get-ChildItem
Get-Host
Get-Location
Get-Process
Get-PSDrive
Get-PSProvider
Get-Service
Get-TraceSource
Get-Variable


Get-Process seems like I could use that and some voodoo of trying to cobble things together by hitting the instances and matching spids but that just sounds like a bloody-hack from hell. There must be something basic that I'm missing, can anyone shed some light?

Alternatives to PowerShell investigated

I had investigated using other job types and didn't get a satisfactory resolution. Research indicated the PowerShell listed under SQL Agent was SQLPS and starting an instance of it by right clicking on the Agent automagically dropped me into the correct location. It was only when I pasted my interactive code into the job step that I learned of the difference as previously mentioned.

Job type of OS put me into an identical state in that I could not find a way to determine which instance dropped me into the command shell. Sure, I could sqlcmd and get the value of @@servername but if I knew what connection to start sqlcmd, I wouldn't need to to query the database ;)

TSQL could probably work if we enable xp cmdshell but I'm not sure if they have it turned on---government facility and they can be persnickety on non-default settings. Even then, I'm stuck futzing with dynamic SQL and losing a lot of the expressiveness and power that PowerShell lends.

While a bit ungainly, I thought defining a variable at the first step and passing that to successor steps but research turned up this article Handling Multiple Job Steps (BOL) 


""Job steps must be atomic. A job cannot pass Boolean values, data, or numeric values between job steps. You can pass values from one Transact-SQL job step to another by using permanent tables or global temporary tables. You can pass values from one CmdExec job step to another by using files.""


I can't use common tricks like a well-known file/environment variables/registry setting that Foo.exe looks for as that would prevent concurrent execution across instances.

tl;dr

In a SQL Agent Job step of type PowerShell, how can you determine the instance of SQL Server that launched the process?
",billinkc,https://dba.stackexchange.com/users/2131,"Sad to say I have not done much with PowerShell scripts being called inside SQL Server. Nor am I at a computer that I could play with it right now.

I believe though instead of using the PowerShell type step that if you used CmdExec and just call your script as you would from a command line ""powershell 'MyScript.ps1'"" you could then pass a parameter that has the instance you are running from. Like ""Powershell 'MyScript.ps1' MyInstanceName"".

So the start of your script you have a param() setup to accept that value of MyInstanceName:


param(
   [Parameter(Position=0,Mandatory=$True)]
   [string]$InstanceName
)
#so if I wanted to use sqlcmd
sqlcmd -S $InstanceName -Q ""SELECT @@VERSION""


As you started out stating the one step needed to know what instance it was on so the PowerShell script could call Foo.exe properly. However, later on you mention being able to pass the value to other steps. If this is true you might want to look at creating a small SSIS package that calls your PowerShell script and does whatever else you need.

&gt;&gt;&gt;


Issues:

Basically, the peeves I'm having are as follows:


My first two functions seems to be taking up too many lines. The first one, subThousand, seems to be this way because of the check made against the last digit of a number from 20 to 99. The logic I applied was, if it ends in 0, use the ByTen list. If it doesn't combined ByTen and ByOne. While effective, I feel like it could use some real work since I think it qualifies as a DRY-violation. Even the final part checking for numbers from 100 to 999 seems to follow the same pattern. Alas, I've tried paring it down but I've honestly hit a roadblock on this one insofar as trying to come up with a creative and clean solution.
My second function, thousandUp is quite the disaster. I tried coming up with a looping function that creates a list of one to three-digit numbers, so that I can call subThousand on each of them from the front to the back (hence the arrZero[::-1]. At the same time, after converting each element in the list to a word, I concatenate it with the appropriate equivalent in the zGroup list, or the list of the ""zero-groups"". However, I personally can't find a safer and more precise way of landing on the ""correct"" spot in the zGroup list to start concatenating.

To get around this, I took the length of the splitByThousands array, adjusted for 0-index, and used it to get the appropriate ""zero-append"" (zap). Before the loop ends, I subtract one from its current value so that it's adjusted accordingly.
In addition, as I'm attempting to make the output as clean as possible, I add a "" "" to the wrd variable so it doesn't concatenate poorly with the zero-append, as well as add a "", "" to the zero-append to separate it from the next zero-group. However, there will be instances that there are no values for some zero-groups. To avoid showing stuff like zero million, I added a check inside. This is the part that makes me die a little inside:

for z in arrZero[::-1]:
    wrd = subThousand(str(z)) + "" ""
    zap = zGroup[lenArr] + "", ""
    if wrd == "" "":
        break
    elif wrd == ""zero "":
         wrd, zap = """", """"
    resArr.append(wrd + zap)
    lenArr -= 1



It works, but it just doesn't look good. Is it possible to do this in list-comprehension form or a better for-loop without turning it into more confusing mush?

I must admit as well that the last part of the code sucks a little. I've done a lot of str--&gt;int conversions inside the functions, then I did one more outside of them. On top of that, my approach to negative numbers is hackish at best (print ""Minus"").
",Manhattan,https://codereview.stackexchange.com/users/38300,"A couple of thoughts:


You only want to output zero in the special case when the number is 0. It would be easiest to handle that special case at the outermost level.
Use "" and "".join and "", "".join to construct strings from parts. The delimiter will be automatically left out when there are less than two parts.


Here's how I would rewrite subThousand as two functions:

def subThousand(inputNum):
    """"""Convert a number &lt; 1000 to words, and 0 to the empty string
    """"""
    num = int(inputNum)  #this should be done at higher level

    parts = []
    if hundreds:
        parts.append(ByOne[hundreds] + "" hundred"")
    if ones:
        parts.append(subHundred(ones))

    return "" and "".join(parts)

def subHundred(num):
    """"""Convert a number &lt; 100 to words, and 0 to the empty string

        tens, ones = divmod(num, 10)
    else:
        tens, ones = 0, num

&gt;&gt;&gt;


Issues:

Basically, the peeves I'm having are as follows:


My first two functions seems to be taking up too many lines. The first one, subThousand, seems to be this way because of the check made against the last digit of a number from 20 to 99. The logic I applied was, if it ends in 0, use the ByTen list. If it doesn't combined ByTen and ByOne. While effective, I feel like it could use some real work since I think it qualifies as a DRY-violation. Even the final part checking for numbers from 100 to 999 seems to follow the same pattern. Alas, I've tried paring it down but I've honestly hit a roadblock on this one insofar as trying to come up with a creative and clean solution.
My second function, thousandUp is quite the disaster. I tried coming up with a looping function that creates a list of one to three-digit numbers, so that I can call subThousand on each of them from the front to the back (hence the arrZero[::-1]. At the same time, after converting each element in the list to a word, I concatenate it with the appropriate equivalent in the zGroup list, or the list of the ""zero-groups"". However, I personally can't find a safer and more precise way of landing on the ""correct"" spot in the zGroup list to start concatenating.

To get around this, I took the length of the splitByThousands array, adjusted for 0-index, and used it to get the appropriate ""zero-append"" (zap). Before the loop ends, I subtract one from its current value so that it's adjusted accordingly.
In addition, as I'm attempting to make the output as clean as possible, I add a "" "" to the wrd variable so it doesn't concatenate poorly with the zero-append, as well as add a "", "" to the zero-append to separate it from the next zero-group. However, there will be instances that there are no values for some zero-groups. To avoid showing stuff like zero million, I added a check inside. This is the part that makes me die a little inside:

for z in arrZero[::-1]:
    wrd = subThousand(str(z)) + "" ""
    zap = zGroup[lenArr] + "", ""
    if wrd == "" "":
        break
    elif wrd == ""zero "":
         wrd, zap = """", """"
    resArr.append(wrd + zap)
    lenArr -= 1



It works, but it just doesn't look good. Is it possible to do this in list-comprehension form or a better for-loop without turning it into more confusing mush?

I must admit as well that the last part of the code sucks a little. I've done a lot of str--&gt;int conversions inside the functions, then I did one more outside of them. On top of that, my approach to negative numbers is hackish at best (print ""Minus"").
","A couple of thoughts:


You only want to output zero in the special case when the number is 0. It would be easiest to handle that special case at the outermost level.
Use "" and "".join and "", "".join to construct strings from parts. The delimiter will be automatically left out when there are less than two parts.


Here's how I would rewrite subThousand as two functions:

def subThousand(inputNum):
    """"""Convert a number &lt; 1000 to words, and 0 to the empty string
    """"""
    num = int(inputNum)  #this should be done at higher level
    hundreds, ones = divmod(num, 100)

    parts = []
    if hundreds:
        parts.append(ByOne[hundreds] + "" hundred"")
    if ones:
        parts.append(subHundred(ones))

    return "" and "".join(parts)

def subHundred(num):
    """"""Convert a number &lt; 100 to words, and 0 to the empty string
    """"""
    if num &gt;= 20:
        tens, ones = divmod(num, 10)
    else:
        tens, ones = 0, num

    parts = []
    if tens:
        parts.append(ByTen[tens])
    if ones:
        parts.append(ByOne[ones])

    return ""-"".join(parts)

","Don't ever reinvent the wheel. Fraction is decently cooperative class, you should never have to write basic operations from scratch. Use the inherited stuff. Here is the solution for basic arithmetic, shouldn't be hard to adapt for many other protocols. Also, it doesn't handle negative numbers because I'm lazy, I trust you can add support for that too.

1196,1196,1880,Changing PhD topic and effect on career,"I'm a PhD student in my third year (4-6 is common in my country) and seriously consider abandoning my current topic. 
The new topic is in the same general field (CS related), yet in a vastly different domain and would need a quite different methods. My advisor suggested this switch, he could keep me funded in both cases, yet probably better with the new topic.

Arguments for switching are both personal interest in the new topic (it's recently trending, I was interested from the beginning, yet few positions were available) and lack of progress in the current area:


I could produce some publications, yet not up to my advisors expectations (should be easier with the new topic, given the impact factors of the journals my advisor suggested)
For the last 6-8 month I made barely any progress (lots of failed experiments)
I would probably have to abandon my current methods anyway due to 1./2., so half a year or so will be lost learning new methods no matter how I decide


Yet I shy away from switching, mainly due to already being quite old (combination of personal problems and a switch of my major as an undergraduate) and fearing how my C.V. would look if I did take about a year longer and had this second switch...

5534,5534,8790,To what extent does the Law of Moses still apply?,"
  Matthew 5:17-18 (KJV)
  17 Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil. 18 For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.


As I understand it, the Law of Moses is fulfilled in Christ. We don't make sacrifices anymore, and many other of the finer points in the Pentateuch are no longer preached.

Yet, I still see people reference these books for doctrine (for example the 10 Commandments).

How much of the Law of Moses still applies?
",tjameson,https://christianity.stackexchange.com/users/130,"There are many separate views to the matter. I'll try to list the most common ones, along with sources (at the end of each section). I'll first just describe the views briefly; the sources are available for those more interested.

Catholic

The Catholic Church teaches that the Law of Moses (the Old Law) is a preparation for the Gospel, and as such no longer binding. The New Law (the Law of Gospel) is a perfection of it, given through faith in Christ.

The Law of the Gospel is presented in the Sermon of the Mount (Matthew 5-7), but also in the moral catechesis of the apostolic teachings, such as Romans 12-15, 1 Corinthians 12-13, Colossians 3-4, Ephesians 4-5, etc.

God's Law has always remained the same, and has always been available as the natural moral law (e.g. through conscience), but only Jesus could express it perfectly.

Source: Catechism of the Catholic Church, Second edition. Paragraphs 577-582 and 1950-1986. http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/ccc_toc2.htm

Reformed

The reformed teaching is that the law was given in three parts:


The moral law, which God gave first to Adam, and later to Moses on Sinai (the Ten Commandments).
Ceremonial laws, given to the people of Israel, prefiguring Christ.
Judicial laws, given to the State of Israel.


The moral law is eternal, binding Adam, the first man, as well as any Christian today.  Ceremonial laws were abolished in the New Testament. Judicial laws only concerned the State of Israel.

As noted, the moral law was delivered to Moses as the Ten Commandments. Thus the Ten Commandments apply to Christians today as such. Of other laws in the OT, the moral component applies.

Source: Westminster Confession, chapter XIX. http://www.reformed.org/documents/wcf_with_proofs/ch_XIX.html

Theonomy

Theonomy literally means ""God's law"". It is the notion that God's law is eternal and universally binding. That is, the entire Bible applies to Christians today.

This doesn't mean that salvation comes by keeping the law, as theonomy is often misrepresented. Salvation is granted ""solely by grace through faith in the person and work of Jesus Christ"".

Psalm 119:97-98 (KJV) is a good verse to show what theonomy is about:


  O how love I thy law! it is my meditation all the day. 
  Thou through thy commandments hast made me wiser than mine enemies: for they are ever with me.


Source: Duncan, T.M. Theonomy: What it is; what it is not. http://www.ipc.faithweb.com/documents/THEONOMY.htm

Dispensationalism

Dispensationalism makes a distinction between Israel and the Christian church in God's plan. Its major objective is to be able to interpret the Bible consistently literally.

Dispensationalists recognize seven dispensations in the Bible:


Innocence (Genesis 1:1–3:7)
Conscience (Genesis 3:8–8:22)
Human government (Genesis 9:1–11:32)
Promise (Genesis 12:1–Exodus 19:25)
Law (Exodus 20:1–Acts 2:4)
Grace (Acts 2:4–Revelation 20:3)
The millennial kingdom (Revelation 20:4-6)


The different dispensations are different ways that God has related to people. Salvation has always been through faith.

As today's Christians are living during the dispensation of grace, or during the New Covenant, the old laws or the Old Covenant do not bind them. Because God and His will do not change, the moral law of the New Covenant hasn't notably changed from the Old Covenant.

I'll try to list the most common ones, along with sources (at the end of each section). I'll first just describe the views briefly; the sources are available for those more interested.

Catholic

The Catholic Church teaches that the Law of Moses (the Old Law) is a preparation for the Gospel, and as such no longer binding. The New Law (the Law of Gospel) is a perfection of it, given through faith in Christ.

The Law of the Gospel is presented in the Sermon of the Mount (Matthew 5-7), but also in the moral catechesis of the apostolic teachings, such as Romans 12-15, 1 Corinthians 12-13, Colossians 3-4, Ephesians 4-5, etc.

God's Law has always remained the same, and has always been available as the natural moral law (e.g. through conscience), but only Jesus could express it perfectly.

Source: Catechism of the Catholic Church, Second edition. Paragraphs 577-582 and 1950-1986. http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/ccc_toc2.htm

Reformed

The reformed teaching is that the law was given in three parts:


The moral law, which God gave first to Adam, and later to Moses on Sinai (the Ten Commandments).
Ceremonial laws, given to the people of Israel, prefiguring Christ.
Judicial laws, given to the State of Israel.


The moral law is eternal, binding Adam, the first man, as well as any Christian today.  Ceremonial laws were abolished in the New Testament. Judicial laws only concerned the State of Israel.

As noted, the moral law was delivered to Moses as the Ten Commandments. Thus the Ten Commandments apply to Christians today as such. Of other laws in the OT, the moral component applies.

Source: Westminster Confession, chapter XIX. http://www.reformed.org/documents/wcf_with_proofs/ch_XIX.html

Theonomy

Theonomy literally means ""God's law"". It is the notion that God's law is eternal and universally binding. That is, the entire Bible applies to Christians today.

This doesn't mean that salvation comes by keeping the law, as theonomy is often misrepresented. Salvation is granted ""solely by grace through faith in the person and work of Jesus Christ"".

Psalm 119:97-98 (KJV) is a good verse to show what theonomy is about:


  O how love I thy law! it is my meditation all the day. 
  Thou through thy commandments hast made me wiser than mine enemies: for they are ever with me.


Source: Duncan, T.M. Theonomy: What it is; what it is not. http://www.ipc.faithweb.com/documents/THEONOMY.htm

Dispensationalism

Dispensationalism makes a distinction between Israel and the Christian church in God's plan. Its major objective is to be able to interpret the Bible consistently literally.

Dispensationalists recognize seven dispensations in the Bible:


Innocence (Genesis 1:1–3:7)
Conscience (Genesis 3:8–8:22)
Human government (Genesis 9:1–11:32)
Promise (Genesis 12:1–Exodus 19:25)
Law (Exodus 20:1–Acts 2:4)
Grace (Acts 2:4–Revelation 20:3)
The millennial kingdom (Revelation 20:4-6)


The different dispensations are different ways that God has related to people. Salvation has always been through faith.

As today's Christians are living during the dispensation of grace, or during the New Covenant, the old laws or the Old Covenant do not bind them. Because God and His will do not change, the moral law of the New Covenant hasn't notably changed from the Old Covenant.

5627,5627,8923,Two different analytic curves cannot intersect in infinitely many points,"A curve in Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^n$, $n \geq 2$ is $analytic$ if the coordinates of its points $x= x_{1},...,x_{n}$ can be expressed as analytic functions of a real parameter $x_{i}=x_{i}(t)$, $i=1,...,n$ and $\alpha \leq t \leq \beta$ and the derivatives $x'(t_{0})$ do not simultaneously vanish for any $t_{0} \in [\alpha, \beta]$.
I search for a proof of the following fact:

If the set of intersection points of two analytic curves is infinite, then these curves coincide.

Can we prove the same as above if we relax the condition that the coordinates are analytic to the condition that the coordinates belong to the class $C^{\infty}$?

Edit: Thanks to below remark by Ramiro, to obtain the above implication, we have to assume that any two curves $K_{1}, K_{2}$ as in the question are such that $K_{1} \cap K_{2}$ is not another analytic curve.

2nd edit: As suggested Peter, we can reformulate our question as follows:
   Consider two immersed curves which are parameterized real analytically on compact intervals. If they have an infinite number of different intersection points, then their union is again a real analytic immersed curve. 
",Grzegorz Tomkowicz,https://mathoverflow.net/users/31376,"Let $f\colon [0,1]\to \mathbf R^n$ and $g\colon[0,1]\to\mathbf R^n$ parametrize your curves. The set $C$ of $t\in[0,1]$ such that there exists $s\in[0,1]$ with $f(t)=g(s)$ is a closed subset of $[0,1]$. More importantly, it is definable in the sense of model theory in the language — called $\mathbf R_{\text{an}}$ — consisting of polynomial functions and so called restricted analytic functions, namely analytic functions defined over compact subsets of $\mathbf R^m$.

It is an important theorem (Gabrielov; Denef and van den Dries) that $\mathbf R_{\text{an}}$ is $o$-minimal. This means that definable subsets of the real line are finite unions of intervals. 

From there, one should be able to analyse the situation further when the coincidence set is infinite. I would conjecture that it can only be the union of one or two intervals. Ramiro gave an example with one interval, though more complicated examples are possible, e.g., of the form $s\mapsto F(u(s))$, $s\mapsto F(v(s))$, where $u,v\colon[0,1]\to\mathbf R$ are analytic and $F\colon\mathbf R\to\mathbf R^n$ is a fixed curve.

4928,4928,7847,How do you deal with amends from a client?,"I'm a web designer currently working with a very demanding client.

I presented them with designs back in May and I'm still working through amends with them. They are making changes to everything and although I know amends are to be expected, it's really getting to be frustrating. I'm currently working every evening on the list of new amends they have. Tiny things like ""make this blue"" or ""change the width of this"" or ""make this gap smaller"".

I know amends need to be made and that's fine, but how do you handle when there are just too many? I've counted the comments on inVision and there have been 185 amends on 6 pages of a website design. 

Some of them change, and then change again, and then change again and again. For example they wanted to add a strapline, so I added it, adjusted all the menus to accomodate is across the 6 pages. Then they wanted to change the text, so I changed it and updated it across all 6 documents. Now that it's changed, they want to make the menu smaller so now I have to go back and change the menu again.

I quoted based on time I thought it would take to complete the designs with some time for amends but I've more than tripled the time. I haven't explained to them early enough in the process that amends beyond the normal would cost them more so I'm going to have to swallow the cost this time, but should I lay this out better with future clients?

How do you handle amends? Do you put an estimated time on them at the beginning, and then charge more if they go over this? Or do you do something different?

And here is the problem. It does not look for single posts that match all criteria. Instead it 'collects' all posts with all tags searched.

For example:

// postid1 -&gt; tag1
// postid2 -&gt; tag2
// postid3 -&gt; tag1, tag2

$substring = ""AND $wpdb-&gt;terms.slug IN ('tag1')""
//Output: postid1, postid3 - - - CORRECT
$substring = ""AND $wpdb-&gt;terms.slug IN ('tag1','tag2')""
//Output: postid1, postid2, postid3 - - -WRONG!

//Expected: postid3


So far i have no idea howto solve it in a single mysql query. Maybe im missing something.

6017,6017,9550,The Discrete Logarithm problem,"I am puzzled with the following discrete logarithm problem:

Given positive integers b, c, m where (b &lt; m) is True it is to find a positive integer e such that

(b**e % m == c) is True


where two stars is exponentiation (e.g. in Ruby, Python or ^ in some other languages) and % is modulo operation. Using general math symbols it looks like:($b^e \equiv c (\mod m)$). 

What is the most effective algorithm (with the lowest big-O complexity) to solve it ?

Given b=5; c=8; m=13 this algorithm must find e=7 because 5**7%13 = 8

1300,1300,2047,Intersection points of two circles.,"I understand that this is a common question and typically I can solve them, but this one keeps messing me up:

Find the points of intersection (A and B) on the circles $x^2+y^2+4x-10y+20=0$ and $x^2+y^2-4x-2y+12=0$; find the equation of the line $AB$.
",John M,https://math.stackexchange.com/users/96901,"The two given equations, only the first of which is a circle, intersect at infinitely many points, not at just points $A, B$, and those points of intersection lie along a common line. It is never possible that the points of intersection of two circles are all the points on any one line. 

We can see this by solving for the points of intersection of the two equations: Since the left-hand sides of each equation is equal to zero, the left-hand sides are equal to one another. This gives us 

$$\begin{align} x^2+y^2+4x-10y+20 &amp; = x^2+y^2-4x-2y+12\\ \\  \iff 8x-8y+8&amp; =0 \\ \\ \iff y&amp; =x+1.\end{align}$$

So if there were a valid intersection, the ""intersection"" would consist of in this line. Can you see why this can not happen, given the first equation is the equation of a circle? If we had the equations of two circles, they would intersect at nowhere, or at one point (if they were tangent), or at 2 points (overlapping but not concurrent), or else at infinitely many points (if they represented the same circle.)

The second doesn't (no object has a radius of $\sqrt{-7}$, which occurs with the second equation if you complete the square to obtain the center and radius a circle would have, if it in were a circle.

She is self employed and comparable health insurance in NY will cost her 2x as much as in Texas, where we are now.

While you can become domestic partners as a hetero couple, I can't see why would you want to (although I'm not a lawyer, talk to a family lawyer on these matters).

You can only get tax benefits and immigration benefits if you're married (and that's a major reason why many gay people are so upset about not being able to). RDP's are not legally married, so they don't get the Federal benefits that married couples do.

Why does it matter to you? Because the insurance is a benefit. You pay it pre- tax from your wages. But if you want it to cover your partner, and you're not married - it is taxed. So the insurance coverage provided by your employer to your partner is taxable income to you, unless you're married.

4786,4786,7599,What is the best way to show the user large amounts of data?,"I am working on an application with a team that has roughly 2 years of data. This data is shown through multiple visualization methods. Part of the application is a settings panel, which lets the user control various things about the application (How much data they see, color schemes, etc.)

In the settings panel, one of the options allows the user to view their data in table format (report style). Because there is about two years worth of data, it's been broken up in to Month and Year increments. If the user wants to export a particular month, they can export that data to a .csv which can then be opened in a third party program like Excel or Calc. This is what it currently looks like with the entire visualization screen:



Close up view:



Even with the data broken up, there is still a substantial amount in each table (probably about 150 rows). This means the user still has to scroll to view the data. My co-workers think this is the best option, however I want to take a different approach.

I personally think that everything in the settings should be something to change the way the data looks or to get some of the data to take somewhere else.

My solution would be to show the user some sample data (maybe 3-4 rows), then give them the option to export as the main function (as opposed to reading it in browser). I think this makes more sense since the user won't have the ability to sort, select, change, etc. like they would in Excel. Mine would look something like this:



It's not perfect, but it should give you a general idea of the look I'm going for. So down to the actual question...

940,940,1490,Amplifier damage caused by failed power supply capacitors,"MY QUESTION IS THIS:
Would failed power supply caps cause peripheral damage to the amp, preamp or control circuits ? Supposedly there is ""protection"" for ""DC offset, over current and over heat""

I have a Proton AM-656 amplifier with ""Dynamic Power on Demand"" which is a second higher voltage supply rail (switched to when needed) that creates 6db of headroom and 2 ohm stable. I did not think there was fault protection, turns out the schematic block diagram states there is.

One day with the amp power on I tightened/snugged up the speaker binding post. There was a single frayed speaker wire (unnoticed) that shorted. The amp proceed to billow smoke. I looked inside to find several power supply caps having oozed their electrolyte onto the circuit board. 

I am shopping to recap two of my other amps and was thinking of recapping the Proton, however I do not want to waste my time if there is likely to be damage to the circuits other than electrolytic capacitors.
",erick77,https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/50159,"If you are going to recap, I can assume you have the tools to check the entire circuit (DMM, etc).  The only way to really know what went wrong is to start tracing through the circuit.

From the answers (thanks!) I think I failed to word this question clearly. Let me try again.

",voithos,https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/3395,"According to the generally accepted theory of the Big Bang, the universe originated between 10,000 and 20,000 million ago years ago and has been expanding ever since.

The uncertain future of the universe: the expansion could be limited (closed universe), shrinking the universe upon itself, or it could be infinite (open universe), in which case the universe will expand forever. 

In the limiting case between these two possibilities (flat universe) nor cease the expansion. At large distances from the observational point of view, the universe is - homogeneous - isotropic. 

If $u$ is the mass density, call $(du / u)$ in $R$ a fractional fluctuations of the mass density, due to the existence of structures (galaxies, galaxy clusters, superclusters), within an area located randomly, radius R. Thus $(du / u)$ in $R$ decreases as a negative power of R. 

This suggests that we can model the universe as made of a soft background of average density, with superimposed fluctuations. A small scales these fluctuations are large but decrease as the scale grows. A sufficiently large scale (greater than about 100 Mpc), the universe can be treated as homogeneous and isotropic then a uniform density.

5776,5776,9153,Information to include with a fine art print?,"I am just beginning to sell some of my images and would like to personalize them a little.  Many photographers sign and title their work on the white space just below the printed image. I am having metal prints made so there is no matting or white space, so I considered printing small (2""x3.5"") stickers to place on the back of the images. What information do you think should be included on that sticker? Pretty much everything I've found online talks about a certificate of authenticity and limited editions. I do not want limited editions but would like to sign and number my larger prints. Does anyone have experience with this? Do I need to print a separate certificate? At this juncture my sticker will have my logo, image title, artist name (me), place for my signature and date, ""edition #xx of an open edition"". Some sites mention including the date the photograph was taken; format (i.e. 24""x36"" photographic print on metal), though it seems redundant since it will be on the back of the print; same goes for description of artwork, as well as copyright as I am signing and dating it. I do plan on printing a second sticker with care instructions (i.e. hang indoors and out of direct sunlight etc.).  

Revision to clarify:
What information should be included? Do I need to put copyright information if I am signing it? Is it necessary to include the format of the print or the shot on date?  Should I also be providing a certificate of authenticity?

Thank you!

5605,5605,8893,Who should pursue a Ph.D degree?,"I am asking myself the question ""Should I do PhD or should I leave academia and go for an industrial career?""

My life-goal is being a professor. And I love to do research. 

PhD is surely a bite that not everyone can chew.
But I wonder who can chew it?

I never was good at tests and exams. My BSc. GPA was 2.84/4.00 but finished my MSc. with 3.50/4.00

However, currently I am working on a conference paper and I feel like even that is too much for me. It has been nearly 3 months and still, the paper draft is to be improved (not the wording but the content).

I am surely a hard-worker but not always. Sometimes, I let go of my work and absorbed in other stuff (composing, amateur radio etc). If this period is too wide, I have to spend double effort to warm-up and remember where I left.

I don't know how things work in PhD. It usually is 5-6 years. It is the one of two most-challenging milestones in academic career (the other is getting the title Assoc. Prof).
Should I completely be a ""nerd"" and work on my thesis systematically (something I could never make in my entire life) or working periodically but with extra effort is still sufficient?

So, here's my question: If I say ""I'm considering to do PhD"" and ask your advice, what would you ask me? What kind of skills/characteristics do you look for a potential academician?

I know it is way too late for me to ask this kind of question, as a person who almost finished his master's degree. But better lose the saddle than the horse. 
",padawan,https://academia.stackexchange.com/users/15949,"You sound a lot like me when I was thinking about doing a PhD, albeit you aim to be a professor, and while I like the idea I'm not so fussed about the administrative side of being in a university.

If you have a tendency to concentrate on whatever is the most interesting thing in front of you, then I would very strongly advise proceeding if and only if you find a good, hands-on supervisor. Ask their previous doctoral students how often they met with them in the first few years - some supervisors will see you once a month or so, others I have heard meet their students individually or collectively several times a week.

In the UK, PhDs are usually 3 years. And the rough schedule is that for the first year you look at one or more problems, trying to understand how you might make some progress. In the second year, you make some small advance on one project and try in vain to develop the project into a more concrete thesis. In the third year you accept that your small advance was all you are going to get, and write it up. The slow pace of progress in the second year commonly causes distress or apathy.

In order to complete such a project, you either need to be personally very disciplined or be part of a team (you, your supervisor, perhaps some peers) that can keep you honest - remember that rubber-ducking is a vital part of academic work; most academics in the UK will congregate in the department kitchen once or twice a day just to talk to other academics, because often just explaining yourself gets you closer to a solution. Similarly, you need people to ask you where you've got to so that you don't just disappear off for a month because you're faced with something annoying and your symphony suddenly seems fascinating.

I struggled with this; my supervisor was hands-off, my peers were in very different fields (I was a theorist among experimentalists for a start) and I didn't really understand my own character enough to see what was happening.

One of my peers had a supervisor who used to take students through rigorous textbooks, and expect them to grasp whole chapters to be quizzed on - the sound of it terrified me, but in retrospect the foundations are well worth laying. Instead I often disappeared down dead-ends because I was unaware of entire fields of research, and just didn't have the terminology or context to find them.

4512,4512,7152,How to calculate the size of the image circle at infinity focus?,"How can I determine the diameter of the image circle (i.e. the diagonal size of CCD required to fully utilise a telescope's optics) at near-infinity focus? I have looked around online and found this calculator, but I am more interested in how the figure was calculated than knowing the figure itself. 

Background: I am new to astrophotography and recently bought a Celestron Nexstar 130 SLT telescope with a Barlow lens, T-adaptor and T-ring to connect it with my Nikon D80 to take photographs of the night sky in prime focus. The telescope dimensions are 130mm aperture and 650mm focal length. With the 2x Barlow lens (required to diverge the focus enough to mount the camera outside the optical tube assembly) it effectively becomes a telescope with 1300mm focal length. I can measure a picture of an object with known angular size (e.g. the moon) and use crop factors to establish a ratio, but this method doesn't help me understand how a bigger/newer telescope would fare on the same CCD. 

Edit:
Since this question now has a bounty, I would like to emphasize the real question is How to calculate the size of the image circle at infinity focus?, and not the follow-up question of 
Would the image circle size decrease if I was able to ditch the Barlow lens?

2077,2077,3308,Powering circuit from PC's USB port,"I am working on a circuit  connected to computer  with FTDI FT232RL. The circuit have got some op-amps and one MCU. Total power consumption (including FTDI chip) is near by 80 mA /h (at 5V). My op-amps need well regulated 5V power (single supply). Here comes the time to design power supply. 
USB Vcc pin is connected to the FT232RL Vcc and MCU's Vcc. The question is this how i should use USB's Vcc pin? 

First connecting USB Vcc to LDO regulator IC like AMS1117 and powering both FTDI IC and MCU + Op-amps with AMS1117's regulated output is good?

USB Vcc-->AMS1117-->FTDI chip+MCU+Op-amps 

Or connecting USB Vcc to FTDI Vcc and a regulator IC on the MCU +Op-amps  is good?

USB Vcc-->FTDI chip-->AMS1117-->MCU+Op-amps 
",user30878,https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/30878,"The XX1117 is not really an LDO regulator, more of a medium-drop-out. 

You need to give it quite a bit more input voltage than you expect out of it. So if your circuitry is happy with 3V (say), you may be okay. You can only count on 4.35V at the USB connector, and the regulator can use as much as 1.3V depending on current etc. so that leaves you with 3.05V. At 80mA, 3.3V may be acceptable, but you'll have to sharpen your pencil to figure that out. 

If you want to create a low-noise well-regulated 5V supply from a USB input, you would have to boost the input to something like 5.5V and use a true LDO or to more like 6.5V and use an XX1117 regulator. At 80% efficiency that means you'd be at about 150mA input current. That's acceptable, but you're supposed to negotiate for current above 100mA. Possibly the FTDI chip does that for you.

The circuit has some operational amplifiers and a single chip microcomputer. The total power consumption (including ftdi chip) is close to 80mA / h (5V). My op amp needs a well regulated 5V power supply (single power supply). It's time to design the power supply.,"The XX1117 is not really an LDO regulator, more of a medium-drop-out. 

You need to give it quite a bit more input voltage than you expect out of it. So if your circuitry is happy with 3V (say), you may be okay. You can only count on 4.35V at the USB connector, and the regulator can use as much as 1.3V depending on current etc. so that leaves you with 3.05V. At 80mA, 3.3V may be acceptable, but you'll have to sharpen your pencil to figure that out. 

If you want to create a low-noise well-regulated 5V supply from a USB input, you would have to boost the input to something like 5.5V and use a true LDO or to more like 6.5V and use an XX1117 regulator. At 80% efficiency that means you'd be at about 150mA input current. That's acceptable, but you're supposed to negotiate for current above 100mA. Possibly the FTDI chip does that for you. If you're dealing with two supply voltages in your system you may have to have voltage translators and so on, and the details will vary a lot depending on exactly what you are trying to accomplish.

1660,1660,2623,Is lots of red juice normal when making sous-vide steak?,"So I made a 1lb hanger steak via sous-vide the other day and cooked it for 45 minutes at 130F.

After I seared in a cast iron pan, I took the meat off of the pan and let it sit for a few minutes and then sliced it up(against the grain) into smaller portions.

I noticed a lot of red juice in the plate as I was slicing it up but after I put it on a plate and it was sitting at the table, the meat almost ended up swimming in red juice.

When I order medium rare steak at a restaurant and it comes out pre-sliced, I don't usually notice this much red juice.

Is this normal?

UPDATE:

Found this great article explaining what was going on:
http://www.seriouseats.com/2009/12/how-to-have-juicy-meats-steaks-the-food-lab-the-importance-of-resting-grilling.html#continued

He has another article about sous vide ( http://www.seriouseats.com/2010/03/how-to-sous-vide-steak.html ) where he claims that you don't need to let the meat rest after searing. This is the one that originally led me to not need to rest the steak.

Looks like there is some resting that is required. Will post up with results next time I make some steak.
",alexpotato,https://cooking.stackexchange.com/users/7454,"Pretty much...yes, but you can fix it!.

When you properly sous vide or very slow cook anything, you'll retain more of the myoglobin color because of the even cooking that often doesn't go above 140 at all.  So a properly cooked steak like this will retain much more of its red colored myoglobin.  Simply put, the meat will have more red juices to release! (Its a great, great thing about sous vide.)

As @Ronald mentions, the other thing is the resting of the meat.  It's an important step as the muscle fibers relax after the heat is off and hold juices better then.  An often misstep for the home cook is they allow a hot piece of meat to rest on a flat, solid surface.  This causes the bottom of the meat to steam against the board, open the fibers in the meat more, and release the juices on to the board.  Rest your meat on a raised baking rack so that it has air circulation all around it.  

After a short rest - for most steak 10 minutes is fine, then you can cut into the steak.  Use a very sharp knife to slice.  The meat here is essentially a sponge and you don't want to compress it and squeeze out the juices.  A dull knife will do this and you'll lose more juice on the cutting board again.  Use a sharp knife and apply steady, even, but light pressure while slicing - let the edge do the work (if it won't, sharpen the knife more).

5668,5668,8988,why ions and electrons are at different temperatures in plasma?,"In plasma, collision rate among ions or electrons is much larger than the collision rate between ions and electrons. why is that so?
",seeking_infinity,https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/57676,"There are lots of different types of plasmas.

In a thermal plasma the electrons and ions will have the same temperature.

In a non-thermal plasma the discharge is driven by some external power supply e.g. capacitatively coupled RF, inductively coupled, pulsed DC E field etc. 

In a non-thermal plasma the electrons generally have a higher temperature than the ions because the energy from the RF or E field couples with the electrons more efficiently. The electrons transfer energy to the gas to sustain the plasma. 

Strictly speaking non-thermal plasmas are not at equilibrium and we cannot necessarily define a temperature, but temperature is generally a useful concept to use.

Collision rates are generally lower for electrons than ions, but not always (e.g. very low energy electrons and SF6 has huge collision rate). 

The reason for the temperature difference is due partly to the driving energy being mostly coupled to the electrons and the partly because the energy is not rapidly transfered by collisions to the neutral gas and ions.

Why is that?","There are lots of different types of plasmas.

In a thermal plasma the electrons and ions will have the same temperature.

In a non-thermal plasma the discharge is driven by some external power supply e.g. capacitatively coupled RF, inductively coupled, pulsed DC E field etc. 

In a non-thermal plasma the electrons generally have a higher temperature than the ions because the energy from the RF or E field couples with the electrons more efficiently. The electrons transfer energy to the gas to sustain the plasma. 

Strictly speaking non-thermal plasmas are not at equilibrium and we cannot necessarily define a temperature, but temperature is generally a useful concept to use.

Collision rates are generally lower for electrons than ions, but not always (e.g. very low energy electrons and SF6 has huge collision rate). 

The reason for the temperature difference is due partly to the driving energy being mostly coupled to the electrons and the partly because the energy is not rapidly transfered by collisions to the neutral gas and ions.

1902,1902,3030,Measuring Resistance of a Wire With an ADC,"I'm trying to design a circuit which can measure small resistances down to 0.1 Ohm and a max. of 10 Ohms. I won't be measuring actual resistors but rather large coil of wires, upto 500 m (as you can imagine, these wires are quite thick).

Here's the circuit I came up with:


The circuit works by maintaining a constant current through the device under test, R2. With a current of 100 mA, R2 would develop a voltage between 10 mV to 50 mV.

I think in an ideal world this would work but in practice I may have a hard time measuring 0.1 Ohms with this - mainly due to the ADC. Let's assume the ADC is 10-bit with VREF of 5V. This translates to 5mV per step. If R2 = 0.1 and Iout = 100 mA, then the voltage present at the ADC would be 50 mV - but I'm not sure how buried under noise this would be.

My question is, should I increase the gain to, say, 50. If the gain is 50, then the voltage present at the ADC would be 500 mV - but the max. measurable resistance would be 1 Ohms. To measure 10 Ohms, I would need to lower the current to 10 mA instead of 100 mA. A way to do that would be use an FET to switch out R1 and connect a 20 Ohm resistor at Iout.

I don't need the circuit to measure the resistance precisely - a tolerance of +/- 10% is fine.
",Saad,https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/3966,"Please, don't use an LM324 if you want to do precision measurements.  

Your opamp has a gain of 5, but you're not using that: Your output is the inverting input, where you have the same signal as the non-inverting, so that's gain x 1.  

The best choice would be an instrumentation amplifier, where you connect the cable's ends to the two inputs. Use a series resistor to ground to create an offset, because InAmps can't go to the rails (at least the 3-opamp types can't). You can use that resistor as a sense resistor for the current source:  



\$V_{IN}\$ sets the current of the current source: 100 mA/V. Suppose the cable's resistance is 5 &Omega;, then the InAmp will see a 500 mV difference on its input. A gain of 10 (gain resistor isn't shown; CircuitLab doesn't have a symbol for InAmps) will give you 5 V out, or 1 V/&Omega;. By changing \$V_{IN}\$ you can change the total gain. Note that Q1 may need a heatsink, especially if Vcc is rather high.  

 

If you expect high resistances you can make a resistor divider with 1 precision resistor to Vref, and one to ground:



The voltage across the cable will be

\$ V_{CABLE} = \dfrac{R_{CABLE}}{R_{CABLE} + 2 R} V_{REF} \$

but if \$R_{CABLE}\$ &lt;&lt; \$2 R\$ the voltage may be too low for an accurate measurement. A low value for \$R\$ helps, but will draw much current.

The MCP6N11 has Rail-to-Rail output and exists in different types for different gains, among which one for a gain of minimum 100.

edit
markrages comments that we don't need an InAmp, and he's right. Here's the solution with a differential amplifier using an opamp:  



The gain is determined by R1 through R4, and if R1 = R3 and R2 = R4 will be   

\$ G = \dfrac{R2}{R1}\$

An InAmp will give you more precision though, and it won't cost you an arm and a leg, so why not?

4265,4265,6799,Is it appropriate to email an eminent researcher in your field?,"Sometimes, I feel to contact some of the eminent researchers in my field for any of the following reasons:


Appreciating their research publication (recent times). They publish in top conferences, which are usually not hosted in my country or nearby.
Requesting comments on some of my research hypothesis
Sometimes just because I am a die hard fan of them. For example, probably the only reason I continued with research in Computer Science was due to Don Knuth.
Sometimes, to know what they think on some specific research area that has propagated due to there work. (Probably looks like some journalistic work)
For knowing how did they tackle the pressures or certain situation during their PhD or research. (Yes, it's vague but these questions come to mind and probably should be answered by oneself or personal interaction, but adding it for the sake of completion)


Since, most of them are located outside my country, I can't visit or phone them. So, how are such emails perceived. Is it appropriate to send such emails, given that they are expected to have very busy schedule and it would probably waste their time?

",krammer,https://academia.stackexchange.com/users/2823,"Here are some of my strayed thoughts.

Think from return of investments, of yours and your idol's

If you ever perceived that your e-mail would be a ""waste of their time,"" then why send it? I feel that most eminent researchers have a trait of ""ignore everyone and head for their goal;"" getting acknowledgement and acceptance is probably not their primary concern. A specific e-mail describing how their work has inspired your study/project is probably fine, but I wouldn't go so far to expect they would reply and give specific comments on your hypotheses.

From your point of view, instead of using the energy and bandwidth to send the e-mails, there are a lot more you can do:

There are many ways to show your appreciation

First, they would probably like to see their work being formally cited and, more importantly, applied to the field or crossed into other fields. Each idea geminated from their work is an appreciation by itself, and in the mean time you can also enhance your publication and research paradigm. The plus is: if you have done enough of it, the big shot may actually contact you and give comments.

Second, you can help preaching the researcher's ideas and agenda. You can write blogs, answer other people questions, use their works in your journal clubs or lectures, etc. to subtly introduce the researcher's teaching to the public. Better yet, refine the researcher's ideas, and incorporate into yours. Become a spiritual successor with your own unique approach. And let your career be inspired by the researcher.

You can learn from someone without establishing communication

For some more senior researchers, look for their auto-biography, biography, interviews, and documentaries that feature them. I will probably never be able to talk to Itzhak Perlman, but I learned a lot about him through books, websites, documentaries, and musics that he plays. (And actually, he has a Youtube channel as well, but I am suffering from too much fanboy shyness to write any comment.)

For younger researchers, try look for their blogs, Youtube channels, open courses, or even biographies of their mentors. All these may help you become more familiar with them.

Another way is to indirectly know them. Most of these researchers would have a lot of students or proteges, who may be closer to your rank and more likely to communicate with you. You may build a relationship with them, and learn a thing or two about their interaction with their mentor.

Try technology

For their new publications... nowadays most online journals allow leaving comments online. You may try to say a nice thing or two there. If they write a blog, that's even easier. Some researchers maintain a LinkedIn page or a Twitter account, try connect with them and follow them. Hope for the best.

Use other famous people as leverage

If you really want to communicate with them, also try using other organizations. For instance, you can write to some online radio station and suggest an interview topic and some guests, which of course will include your idolized researcher. You can also write to some prominent podcast hosts and give them a couple reason to invite so and so for an interview. Make good use of crowdsourcing, invite your peers and friends to support your petition.

Some heroes/heroines are better left a bit mysterious

This is sad but occasionally painfully true. Some famous people are better left not known at personal level. They could be immensely arrogant, they may not have a nanogram of social skill, they may be a jerk... Unless I have reconstructed a pretty concrete and reliable image about the researcher from different sources, I would probably want to keep them as what they are in my mind, and as an inspiration for my work.

3326,3326,5309,Why does my 24VDC fan draw much less current than labeled?,"I have three Delta PFB0824UHE, which were provided to me by a customer for a project. They are labeled 0.93A.



When actually hooked up to 24V, the fan draws .45A, regardless of head pressure. This current varies linearly with input voltage, going as low as .2A and as high as .5A across the fan's spec'd input voltage range. I have three units, which all behave the same. 

The datasheets I find for this part indicate a current draw of 0.77A.

I’m confused as to how much current I should actually expect this fan to draw. Do fan manufacturers typically allow that much overhead in their specs? Are they subject to manufacturing variations to that degree? Do I perhaps have some special variant of the fan, and not know it? Are they perhaps mislabeled? Should I expect the fan's current draw to increase over time, or with temperature or some other variable?

  17 Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil. 18 For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.


As I understand it, the Law of Moses is fulfilled in Christ. We don't make sacrifices anymore, and many other of the finer points in the Pentateuch are no longer preached.

Yet, I still see people reference these books for doctrine (for example the 10 Commandments).

How much of the Law of Moses still applies?

Then eventually the flood. The answer is found in the reason for the flood. ""The LORD saw how great the wickedness of the human race had become on the earth, and that every inclination of the thoughts of the human heart was only evil all the time. (Genesis 6:5)""

So God's desire can be explained in the inverse: ""God would see it great if the human race was kind on the earth, and that every inclination of the thoughts of the human heart was only good all the time.""

This idea is also proven by Jesus himself: Jesus said to him, “‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind.’ This is the first and greatest commandment. The second is like it: ‘Love your neighbor as yourself.’ All the law and the prophets depend on these two commandments.” -Matthew 22:37-40

The description of kindness and good thoughts of a human heart: If you where set to the task of ruling people toward God's desire. What might you put on your list? (Ok, nobody kill each other, don't steal, etc.)

Why the List didn't work? Pride, Ego, Natural Rebellion (Simply because the list exist).

So if we never took negative matters into our own hands, and relied only on God to justly handle the situation. We can prevent ourselves from getting angry.

Does this ideology match with the teachings? Do not take revenge, my dear friends, but leave room for God's wrath, for it is written: ""It is mine to avenge; I will repay,"" says the Lord (Romans 12:19). But I tell you, do not resist an evil person. If anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to them the other cheek also (Matthew 5:39). But now ye also put off all these; anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy communication out of your mouth (Colossians 3:8). When they kept on questioning him, he straightened up and said to them, ""Let any one of you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her."" (John 8:7)

What evidence do we have that God will take care of it for me? When they began to shout and praise, the Lord suddenly attacked the Ammonites, Moabites, and men from Mount Seir who were invading Judah, and they were defeated (2 Chronicles 20:22).

1445,1445,2276,Protractor test vs long-polling,"I have an Angular web app that continuously listens for notifications from the backend via long-poll:

scope.notification = $resource('/notification').get();


This request never completes in the test environment. This is a problem for Protractor, because it wants to wait for all outstanding HTTP requests to finish.

I see a number of potential solutions, but have some issues with all of them.

I do not see a way to tell Protractor to ignore this request. Issuing it from $interval (which itself is ignored) is not a solution. Protractor will not wait for the request to be sent, but once it's sent, it will still wait for it to complete.

So I'm trying not to send this request when running the tests. But how do I know I'm in a test?


I could add a flag to the URL (?protractor=true). But my web app modifies the URL all the time, so it would get cleared quickly.
I tried setting a variable: browser.executeScript('window.runningProtractorTests = true;'); But it seems Protractor will wait for the page to sync first before running executeScript. And I'm sending the request right away when the page loads.
I could set a cookie. But it's fairly cumbersome, e.g. I'd have to load the page twice. (See issue 341 for more difficulties.)
I could set a user agent. It's not easy either. I would need to set browser flags for each browser in the config file. I do not want to completely override the user agent (to Protractor, for example) out of fear that my libraries may rely on interpreting the user agent string, so I'd have to figure out the right string.
I could check if the server is running on a specific port. But then a year from now someone will try to run the production server on the same port and not understand why the notifications don't work.
Making the test backend complete the request immediately does not help, because it's immediately sent again whenever it completes. But I guess I could introduce a special ""you are in a test"" notification and stop the polling when this is received. This would mean a (small) change to our protocol, so I'd rather avoid it if possible.


Is there no straightforward way to do this?

1938,1938,3091,How do you decide when a paladin has fallen from grace in DnD 5e?,"There does not seem to be a clear-cut way to determine when a paladin's actions have become egregious enough to justify them breaking their oath. Do a lot of minor slights eventually add up and cause an oath to be broken? Do they get some sort of warning like losing their laying on of hands ability? 
",adclark09,https://rpg.stackexchange.com/users/22899,"My opinion is that, for the most part. it is when they break an obvious part of their oath (like using poison for example) or willing commit a truly evil act with no good end.

Though on specific part of oaths. I feel that there are exceptions that a specific paladin can have. I'll use an example I had from a character

Scandal: The character had a flaw/compulsion to be a dracophile from his dragon blood. So I said that to avoid falling from favor and becoming shunned by the people he protected, he could lie about that part of his personality.

Though on specific part of oaths. I feel that there are exceptions that a specific paladin can have. I'll use an example I had from a character

Scandal: The character had a flaw/compulsion to be a dracophile from his dragon blood. So I said that to avoid falling from favor and becoming shunned by the people he protected, he could lie about that part of his personality.

1116,1116,1752,How is encapsulation used for safety?,"I am learning OOP. I have studied much about encapsulation but the more I read the more I became confused.

I understand we hide (by making private) data and expose it to user of class (other developers) as properties or methods. I also understand by encapsulation we hide details.

In an article (http://www.csharp-station.com/Tutorial/CSharp/lesson19) I read:

Abstract from article

When designing an object, you must think about how others could use it. In a best-case scenario any program using the object would be well designed and the code would never change. However, the reality is that programs do change often and in a team environment many people touch the same code at one time or another. Therefore, it is beneficial to consider what could go wrong as well as the pristine image of how the object should be used.

In the case of the BankAccount object, examine the situation where code outside of your object could access a decimal Amount field or a string CustomerName field. At the point of time that the code is written, everything would work well. However, later in the development cycle, you realize that the BankAccount object should keep track of an int CustomerID rather than string CustomerName because you don't want to duplicate relationships between information (or some other valid reason to alter the definition of internal state). Such changes cause a rippling effect in your code because it was built to use the BankAccount class, as originally designed (with CustomerName being a string), and you must now change code that accesses that state throughout your entire application.

The object-oriented principle of Encapsulation helps avoid such problems, allowing you to hide internal state and abstract access to it though type members such as methods, properties, and indexers. Encapsulation helps you reduce coupling between objects and increases the maintainability of your code. 

Question
How will encapsulation help when making changes in code and from its rippling effects.
For a data member, if I change its type from int to float, (even if I am exposing this using property) I will need to change variable type where I am using already using this code.

Kindly guide me how encapsulation will help with such changes.

Thanks for this help and guidance.

  How will encapsulation help when making changes in code and from its rippling effects.


Let me give you a typical and simplistic example. 
First, suppose you are not using encapsulation:
You have a set of data and use an array to store that data, and there is another part of your program that uses that array. Now, if at some point you decide that a linked list is a better choice for storing your data. If you replace array with linked list, what is going to happen? Your program will break, unless you make changes all over the place to replace the array-processing logic with linked-list-processing logic.

But, if you use OO/Encapsulation, then you probably partition your program into classes, one that store the data, and other, that uses the data. In the first class, you hide your implementation (encapsulation), and expose your services through methods like

size()
remove(int index)
add(int index, Object o)
get(int index)

...


In this second case, if you change the implementation of the storing class from array to linked list, or to any other thing, it will not affect your clients. No ripple effect.

2986,2986,4761,"Are DSLRs a dying breed, making now the time to switch to a mirrorless camera system?","I came across this thought provoking article on Stuck in Customs today that makes a strong case to hold off too much investment in DSLR gear, and instead switch to mirror-less cameras like the Sony NEX. The author prefers to call such cameras 3rd generation cameras to prevent any bias.

The crux of the argument lies in the smaller size and faster shooting speeds of the new cameras, while the sensor size is an area where they seem to be lacking (Sony &amp; Samsung cameras are APS-C sized though). Currently the big makers - Nikon &amp; Canon - have practically no presence in this market (Nikon seems to be doing something with the V1). However, they seem to have slowed down the introduction of new entry level DSLR models over the last year as well.

So, as DSLR users looking to build and enhance their kit (there are many like me who've jumped the bandwagon over the last couple of years, and are just starting to build their kit), what are the advantages of sticking with the DSLR system rather than switching to the 3rd gen cameras?

IMO, one point that could cause a massive switch in the DSLR base would be if Nikon &amp; Canon announced mirror-less models compatible with their current lens lineups, but that is a hypothetical scenario.

P.S. There is a similar question on mirror-less cameras, but that seems to be from the perspective of a person starting out rather than a person already invested in the DSLR system.

4692,4692,7440,How does the colour of ambient lighting affect colour rendition?,"How does the colour of ambient lighting affect colour rendition?

For example:

If I stand under a sodium-vapour (orange) streetlight and calibrate my camera's white balance, what effect would this have if I were to take a photo of a colour test chart?  Presumably, white would still render as white due to the white balance calibration, but how would other colours be rendered?

How would the result differ under primary and secondary coloured lighting, e.g. a red or yellow light?

Thanks.
",gjb,https://photo.stackexchange.com/users/3775,"mattdm has it spot on - it's not the colour temperature that matters, it's the width of the spectrum. Here are some examples that illustrate the difference nicely.

Here's an image I shot a while ago at a bonfire. Straight of camera, without the white balance set it looks massively orange:



And here's an image shot just now under sodium vapour streetlights (I spent a while looking for any image I'd shot under streetlights, which number very few until I realised I just had to step out my front door!)



Looks similar. But if you play with the white balance in the first image, you can pull it back to somewhere near neutral. This is because the fire being an incandescent (hot) lightsource, emits a broad spectrum. It just happens to be centred on yellow rather than white like sunlight (which is another incandescent source, but much hotter!). We can simply shift the colours to obtain something more similar to daylight:



Now you can now make out the difference between foliage, skintones and denim. The streetlight image, on the other hand is lit with a fluorescent lightsource. These lights emit very narrow frequency spikes, the light is not just centred on orange, it's orange alone and no other colour! If you try to shift it so the spectrum is centred on white like we did with the bonfire image, we end up with this:



Which is effectively monochrome, even after massive saturation boost - the colours just aren't there. The apparent colours at the top and bottom are actually a lens defect that's been brought out due to the lack of colour information and exaggerated by the saturation boost (+50 in Adobe Camera Raw).



For completeness here's a Gretag MacBeth colour rendition chart shot under the same streetlight. White balance was set in ACR based on the ""grey"" tile:



As you can see the image might as well be monochrome. No amount of gelling of the light, or white balance adjustment can save the image. The colour information simply is not present! If you only have line spectra, all that you'll get back is how much of that particular frequency your subject reflects. Getting technical, colour is a vector-valued variable, that is it consists of several coordinates in the colour space. You can't record a point in colour space with a single value (just like you can't describe your point on a map with one value) which is what you have when you illuminate your scene with only one wavelength of light.

This is why fluorescent lights are bad, many of them emit very narrow spectra (though broader than your average streetlight). In particular many are missing a chunk of the red part of the spectrum which results in unnatural greenish skintones. 

Not all fluorescent lights are bad, here's the chart illuminated by the fluorescent lights in my house which were specifically chosen for their wide spectrum (as described by the CRI (colour rendering intent) number of 93 (sunlight is 100)):

  Would 2,5-dinitropyrrole be a product of nitration of pyrrole with $\ce{H2SO4/HNO3}$?


I doubt it and would rather expect a lot of tar to be formed here. Pyrrole tends to undergo acid-catalyzed polymerization!

For decades, acetyl nitrate, formed by addition of fuming nitric acid to acetic anhydride, is the reagent of choice. 

Mononitration of pyrrole predominantly gives 2-nitropyrrole, accompanied by minor amounts of 3-nitropyrrole. (K.J. Morgan and D.P. Morrey, Tetrahedron, 1966, 22, 57-62. DOI). 

In the case of 1-methylpyrrole, the yield of the 3-nitropyrole is somewhat larger (H.J. Anderson, Canad. J. Chem, 1957, 35, 23-29). In you want even more of the 3-nitro isomer, a more bulky alkyl substituent (t-Bu) or N-silylation with $\ce{((CH3)CH)2SiCl}$ is a viable approach.

Nitration of 2-nitropyrrole at -15 °C with nitric acid in acetic anhydride  furnishes a 4:1 mixture of 2,4- and 2,5-dinitropyrrole with a total yield of 61%. (R. Alan Jones, Gerritt P. Bean, The Chemistry of Pyrroles: Organic Chemistry: A Series of Monographs, Vol. 34, Academic Press, p. 124)

1082,1082,1710,Preventing player passivity in GUMSHOE?,"I really like the game worlds of the various GUMSHOE games I have (Fear Itself, Esoterrorists, Mutant City Blues) but haven't run it yet.  My big concern is that I've seen the ""ablative skill system"" kind of mechanic work very poorly in other games - players hoard their ""uses,"" or use them all and then sit on their hands during the latter part of the game session because they know they're not going to be able to succeed at anything and trying will just get them killed.  

In GUMSHOE, your skills are a ""pool"" of points that you spend either for benefits or for adds to the dice when testing.  You basically roll d6 + spend vs a difficulty, typically 4 for general stuff but often going higher.  Fighting works the same way, so if you have a Scuffling pool of 8, once you've used them all, you know you won't live through any meaningful combat.  

For those that have run GUMSHOE or similar ablative systems, do you find that happening, and what are ways to avoid it?  I mean, I don't mind trying to capture the ""downward spiral"" but it risks characters just checking out if they don't think whatever plot is at hand is really worth all their lives.  ""Let's try to save her next session..."" 
",mxyzplk,https://rpg.stackexchange.com/users/140,"It seems to me that there are a number of things that you could do to help ameliorate this sort of risk.

The first would be to allow ablative skills to regenerate more frequently rather than just at the start of a session. If you intend to have a couple of scenes in a session which require the same skills (such as a combat), allow the PCs to regenerate their skills between. This would allow for the drama of getting tired (running out of points) during a scene, without that scene affecting others. Depending on how finely tuned GUMSHOE is however, this could be unbalancing.

Another option would be to reward ingenuity, good tactics, good role-playing or heroism etc. with point pool replenishments after or even during the scene. Since it's more under your control, it should be less prone to unbalancing the game.

I have seen this sort of thing with players in card based systems like SAGA, but only with relatively new players. Once you've played SAGA for a while you realise that the best thing you can do with a hand of low cards is to play them and hope to draw better cards, so any solution to this problem is likely to involve players being encouraged to be more active, more inventive, more dramatic when they get down to fewer pool points.

I know my thoughts are rather general, since I haven't played GUMSHOE, but I hope they were useful nevertheless.

For really starters, I'd suggest Paul Hewitt's book Conceptual Physics.

For A+ high school students, I'd recommend Feynman's Lectures. These lectures serve as complement for the other books, but personally it's not for beginners

If I give them too much choice is it possible they will give me bad reviews, or is the opposite more often true?

  How much choice should I give users?


As little as possible that can net as large users as possible. As a rule of thumb, don't add choices when it does not matter. 

If the selling point of your app is productivity, only add choices when it affects workflow significantly. Again, don't add trivial customizations, things like position of buttons, colors, etc usually does not really matter.

If the selling point of your app is customization and personalization (most apps should not have this as the main selling point), things are a little different, put a set of different options as complete ""themes"" instead of individual options. Most people cannot make good themes, even if they think they do; you'll be having people walk around showing off your app with their crappy customizations. 

If the selling point of your app is ease of use, then less is more. Less means everyone will be using the same app the same way and there is less mine traps for the less proficient users.

Giving too many options is often born out of laziness, you're not doing your user research enough to actually know what they really needed so you give everything.

1584,1584,2492,Is it ethical to profit by having my students buy my textbook?,"This question was suggested to me by How can I sell my text book to my students in e-book format? which asked about the practicalities, but attracted many comments about the ethics.  So this question is to ask about the ethics directly.

Suppose I have written and published a textbook, and I want to use it as the text for a course I am teaching.  I receive royalties from each copy of my book that is sold, so if my students are required to buy my textbook for the course, I will make some money.  Is it ethical to do so?

Well-reasoned opinions would be useful answers, but even more useful would be pointers to institutional policies, professional codes of ethics, etc, that address this issue.

Of course, there are many ways to avoid profiting from the sale of my book to my students.  If my contract with my publisher allows it, I could distribute PDFs to my students, or have the university bookstore print out copies and sell them at cost.  Another approach I've heard of is to compute how much I earn in royalties on each copy, and refund that amount from my pocket to each student who buys a copy.  Or, use my royalty earnings to buy pizza for the class.  Certainly these are nice gestures, but I would like opinions on whether they are ethically required.

Edit: To address some questions that have arisen in the comments:


This question is hypothetical.  I haven't published any textbooks myself and have no immediate plans to do so.  In any case, my personal preference would be to make the book available to students for free, if at all possible.  So I've phrased this question in the first person for rhetorical convenience only.
I had intended the question to be only about the potential financial conflict of interest that could arise if I make money by assigning my own book.  Some of the answers feel that it is improper for me to assign my own textbook at all, whether I make money or not, but I don't think this point of view is prevalent within the academic community.  If it happens that my book (as a pithy but now-deleted comment put it) ""blows"", I think most would agree that my decision to assign it is pedagogically unfortunate, but not unethical.  
I don't literally mean that students would be required to buy the book, only that they'd be expected to have it.  I might assign readings or homework problems from the book, so that the student needs access to the book in order to do them, but they could certainly achieve this by getting a used copy or borrowing from a friend.  But probably most students would buy new copies anyway, since that is the most convenient way.

The answers in the previously referenced Ask Ubuntu answer no longer apply - there is no more patch to be found on the ""official"" guake.org site, as that site lost its domain on 20th October, 2014 and has not been updated nor is there a new site. There is no response either regarding that from the official maintainers at the github repository for guake. any other suggestions on making this work, or should i just uninstall?

Also, if the software, and its patches and its ""official"" site are not going to be maintained, I feel it should be removed from the Ubuntu Software Center - it is deceiving to install something only to have it not work and no other solution available.

please advise.

The typical suggestion is to never use ECB, but if there is just a single block being encrypted, is it a concern?

The reason I want to use ECB is because I want the encrypted value of the block to be consistent between encryptions for other reasons (so I can check if a value already exists by just comparing the uniqueness of the cipherText).

Updated: Also note that these encrypted values will be stored in a set, so there will not be data leakage by having multiple encrypted values of the same plainText available.

For 32 bytes (e.g. a US SSN encoded in UTF16 or perhaps ASN.1 or XML): no, ECB is unsafe. This extend to any standard block cipher mode of operation modified by fixing IV. Problem is, plaintexts that match in the first block, but not the second, will match in the first block of the ciphertext, but not the second, which leaks information (e.g. in the US SSN format, it allows to cluster plaintexts by identical area number if the block frontier happens to be on the right of that).

594,594,927,Are there any commercially available crystals in the sub 32 kHz range?,"I'm looking for a low power clocking solution and it looks like crystals bottom out at 32 kHz.  Are there any low power (nA) solutions (crystals/ceramic resonators/custom transistor oscillator circuitry) that operate on nanoAmps of power in the single digit kHz range or lower?

EDIT

I wanted to summarize the facts from the answers below as well as my own research:


Crystals do not commercially exist lower than the standard 32 kHz flavor, due to size/resonance constraints of the quartz used internally (thanks to Olin Lathrop)
For a 32 kHz clock solution in the 100s of nA range, this oscillator IC could be used (thanks to stevenvh)
For lower frequencies (but not necessarily nA current consumption) many silicon oscillators, frequency synthesizers, PLLs, or real time clocks include internal clock divider circuitry and can be used to generate clocks as ""slow"" as 1 Hz.


So there is no solution which satisfies both of the constraints of sub-32 kHz &amp; sub-\$\mu\$A operation, but individual solutions that will satisfy one or the other.

Nothing lost, by the way. They won't help you meeting your low power requirements, anyway. A crystal needs a certain power to maintain its oscillation, and if you look at the datasheets you'll often see drive levels in the order of 1mW.  

The lowest power microcontroller application using a crystal I designed was an MSP430 running at 32.768kHz, and that used 3\$\mu\$A, a thousand times your requirements.

Automate the deployment of new websites, quickly and easily without having to manually initiate each new website in an admin panel. For instance, I've seen dropbox-based solutions that claim to make it simple to setup new websites on your dropbox account, but you still have to set each one up in an admin interface first. It would be so much easier to have a folder naming convention that allowed the user to easily clone/copy/duplicate sites inside their Dropbox App folder (https://www.dropbox.com/developers/blog/23) to create new ones. Sounds interesting, however...
It's easy to manage CNAMEs on the registrar-side, but is there a way to quickly associate CNAMEs with new websites (on the hosting side), maybe using the method offered by gh-pages-style (https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-a-custom-domain-with-pages)? With GitHub's gh-pages, all you have to do is drop a file called CNAME into your repo, with the domain name you want associated with the repo inside the file. gh-pages isn't a good solution for what I'm doing though unfortunately.


I'm also a front-end developer, specializing in rapid web development and ""front-end build systems"", so I building and maintaining static assets for hundreds of sites is no problem. It's the hosting-side that I really struggle with. Any suggestions?

Edit: I should also mention that managing my own servers is not an option. As a last resort I might look to build a 3rd party service on top of AWS, Azure etc. but managing servers directly is exactly what I'm trying to get away from.
",jonschlinkert,https://webmasters.stackexchange.com/users/20163,"@jonschlinkert setting up CNAMES has nothing to do with adding a single HTML page to 700 domains. CNAME's won't help any with SEO.

4292,4292,6841,"What is the Goal of ""Hot Network Questions""?","There has been a tug-of-war in the hot-questions list.

Community members like JonW seem to be unhappy with the traffic that it brings to their site:


  'But we want to encourage people to post, that's the whole point of the HQ list!' I hear you cry. I disagree. We want to encourage people to the site not just to that question.


The SE Community Team seems to have a different opinion as Shog9 points out (emphasis mine):


  the results have been... Not great so far: a significantly smaller number of people are clicking through to randomly-selected questions than to the top questions, which hints that the algorithm may've been doing a better job of identifying general-interest questions across topics than some expected.


Disclaimer: This should not be taken as a slight of the community team whatsoever, nor do I think this is some cause for revolt or a boxing match as the below prose may indicate. These are just poorly applied literary tools to emphasize the drastically different approaches to the same list between two groups.

In the Red Corner, the Community Members

The goal of the hot questions should be to drive up interest in the site. The hot questions should be a lure to encourage SE network users to contribute to other content, not just do a drive-by on the hot question.

In the Blue Corner, the Community Team

The goal of the hot questions should be to drive traffic to general-interest questions. After all, the Hot Network Questions used to be more accurately named as ""Popular Questions"".

What is the Goal of Advertising Network Questions?

Before discussing how to calculate hotness, or how the list should be ordered, we need to come to an agreement on what the heck we are actually trying to achieve. Once we know what we are looking to accomplish, we can find the best way to do that.

The list of questions from a variety of sites is in a great location screen-wise, it is readily accessible and does get a lot of eyes on it. But as with any marketing, the goal isn't just to grab eyes, it's to grab the right eyes.*

* I have nothing against left eyes. Most of my friends have left eyes too. And they are awesome. But in the context right eyes are not a geospatial thing, but rather in the 'correct' sense.

So what are the right eyes? What type of people do we want to attract to our site? What would we determine as 'success'? How can we measure that success?

Please do not limit yourself to the very narrowly scoped topic above. Think outside the box if you'd like. On every page across the network we have a nice piece of real estate for showing off the rest of the network. How can that space best be used if not on a list of questions picked by an arbitrary algorithm?

In the....other corner, random intermittent positive reinforcement

Studies have shown that random intermittent positive reinforcement can be more effective that purely positive reinforcement. This means that a reward that is given for good behaviour, but only sometime and to varying degrees, is more effective than a proportional reward. This is perhaps because people are always chasing the next ""big score"".

So what has this got to do with hot questions?

Hot questions are (one can only hope) good questions with a good answer since the upvotes are a major part of what drives them - So the positive part is taken care of. 

However, it is rare to get one of your questions/answers on the ""Hot questions"" list, and I haven't been able to detect much of a pattern (except that the questions seem to be more easily understandable to a general audience and are high quality) - So the intermittent random portion is taken care of.

And I think we can all agree you are heavily rewarded for having a good answer/question in the hot questions list.

My experience

When I got my first answer on the hot questions list it was the most exciting Stack Exchange had been since the initial honeymoon period was over. These rare periodic large rewards are key to keeping long term expert users loving the site.

Conclusion

I'm not saying that random intermittent positive reinforcement should be the main goal of the hot questions list. But it is an additional positive effect to take into consideration.

954,954,1511,put an html (scripted) menu in a separate file,"I have a menu that I've created using jquery that ""pops-up"" on certain button mouse-overs.

it has a LOT of options and sub-menu options and I'd like to put it into a separate file so that it only needs to be downloaded once and all of the html markup and text doesn't need to be re-downloaded every time a user hits a sub page on my site.

I was toying with the idea of using the jquery template engine but couldn't quite wrap my head around the best way to work that.  This isn't a template after all, but a static menu.

2996,2996,4776,What is inspiration?,"I've noticed a new mechanic in the 5th edition rules that stands out from the rest. It's called Inspiration.

What is this, what is it good for and how should I as a DM grant it?

It looks like it's simply a way to grant advantage for good role-playing? Is this what it's meant for or does it have more meaning than this?
",wax eagle,https://rpg.stackexchange.com/users/1084,"To players, mechanically, Inspiration is a token you spend to gain advantage on a roll, and that’s all it is. You can only ever have one of these tokens in your possession, which is incentive to use Inspiration up quick and not hoard it. You can also pass that token to others, so you might do that if you’re about to get a second one.

The true reason Inspiration exists, though, is this: it's a mechanical reward for playing the way the Dungeon Master appreciates. The guidance is thin, and that’s what it comes down to, though the guidance doesn't say it in such explicit terms. To support saying that, I’ll quote in full everything (everything) from the Basic Rules about how you acquire Inspiration, barring the example, found on pages 35-36:


  Inspiration is a rule the Dungeon Master can use to reward you for playing your character in a way that’s true to his or her personality traits, ideal, bond, and flaw.
  
  Your DM can choose to give you inspiration for a variety of reasons. Typically, DMs award it when you play out your personality traits, give in to the drawbacks presented by a flaw or bond, and otherwise portray your character in a compelling way. Your DM will tell you how you can earn inspiration in the game.
  
  (further down, after the example...) Additionally, if you have inspiration, you can reward another player for good roleplaying, clever thinking, or simply doing something exciting in the game. When another player character does something that really contributes to the story in a fun and interesting way, you can give up your inspiration to give that character inspiration.


That’s all the guidance there is in the Basic Rules. The guidance suggests to use Inspiration for roleplaying consistent with one’s character sheet, but then gives the DM the freedom to choose to award it however they want:


  Your DM will tell you how you can earn inspiration in the game.


So given that, and the fact the DM is the only one who can create new Inspiration, the entire mechanic comes down to being a device to encourage the players to play the way the DM wants.

That can be used to constructive or destructive ends. People are going to have Opinions about how Inspiration should be used, and what ways are good or bad, but the Basic Rules guidance begins and ends at the above. That guidance certainly seems to fit in with D&amp;D’s established notion that the DM has precedence over the players, and enhances that idea.

Inspiration could be used like Fate points, and awarded as compensation and reward for a player making a mechanically suboptimal choice. (Apparently, the Starter Set suggests as much!) However, D&amp;D 5e presently lacks pretty much all of the mechanical support and a large amount of play guidance that drives Fate points working the way they do. Note the conspicuous absence of “the players can suggest they should probably get it” in the guidance, for instance. Choosing to use Inspiration this way is entirely a choice of the group. The management of Inspiration can also be made by group cooperation, but again, that’s a choice of the group.

It seems the authors could have included Inspiration to be a solution to all those complaints of “my player isn’t roleplaying consistent with their character’s alignment and story!” - since then the DM just penalises that player with no Inspiration whilst they’re doing that. I have Opinions on whether this is healthy for the game, and so will others.

At the end of the day: consider whether there’s behaviour you want to encourage in your game, and if it’s healthy to provide mechanical incentive for players to behave that way. If so, use Inspiration for that.

",arney,https://tex.stackexchange.com/users/21828,"Since the question is about plain TeX, I would suggest using token list registers for this rather than macros, since token lists are there specifically for this purpose, namely to hold token lists. Create one with

\newtoks\MyList


Assign an explicit list to it by for instance

\MyList={\textbf{My text}}


or any other (balanced) token list between the braces; since this is about gathering tokens, you can be sure there is no attempt to expand anything there. Unlike macros, token list registers do no spontaneously expand to the tokens they hold (if TeX encounters the name of a token list register when expecting an action, it will assume this starts an assignment to the register, and protest if no opening brace follows), so to get at the contents, you must explicitly expand with \the. Hence if at the end of the day you want to transfer the tokens to become the body of a macro, you can say

\edef\macro{\the\MyList}


(the \edef is used because the contents of \MyList is wanted here and now, not later when \macro gets expanded). Note that even though \edef usually keeps expanding as far as it can, the result of \the applied to a token list register is explicitly excluded from any further expansion attempts, so you can be sure that \macro will expand to exactly the tokens that were collected in \MyList.

Now to extend to contents of a token list register is fairly simple; you must just ensure the the old contents gets to be expanded into the new token list before the assignment is made. For this a single \expandafter will do:

\MyList=\expandafter{\the\Mylist more tokens here}


When you need to expand something towards the end of the token list, it takes a bit more effort. Say you want to append to the contents of \MyList that of another token list register \AnotherList. Then you could ensure that the rightmost list gets expanded, and then the leftmost one (can you see why this order is necessary?), all this before the assignment takes place, by a whole slough of \expandafters:

\let\x=\expandafter
\MyList=\x\x\x{\x\the\x\MyList\the\AnotherList}


However there is  an easier way, that mixes the expansive nature of \edef and the passive nature of token lists to get detailed control over expansion. It needs an auxiliary macro, say \temp:

\edef\temp{\the\MyList\the\AnotherList}
\MyList=\exandafter{\temp}


I final remark about the question; you suggest that \let serves to copy the expansion of one macro to another macro without further expanding that expansion
(as using \edef would do). While \let can be used for that, this is not its main purpose, and in fact this is just a corollary of what \let does in general: transfer the current meaning of one token to another one (provided the latter can have its meaning modified, so it should not be a non-active character). This is not limited to macros: you can make a control sequence stand for a plain character, or for a TeX primitive (as I did above to let \x stand for the primitive \expandafer; note that having instead \x expand to \expandafer would be quite different and quite useless) or for other meanings that a token can have. Just as an example of the last possibility, saying

\let\newname=\MyList


would transfer the current meaning (not the contents!) of \MyList to \newname. Since \MyList stood for an internal token list register of TeX, this makes \newname stand for the same register: it becomes an alias for \MyList, and assigning to one of them changes the contents of the other as well.

Sometimes, to know what they think on some specific research area that has propagated due to there work. (Probably looks like some journalistic work)
For knowing how did they tackle the pressures or certain situation during their PhD or research. (Yes, it's vague but these questions come to mind and probably should be answered by oneself or personal interaction, but adding it for the sake of completion)

How does &quot;be altruist to those who are similar to you&quot; evolve?

Altruism that is


Not reciprocal
Not familiar


has little explanation. One possible explanation is that the trait itself may correlate well with genetics. One great answer there is that often the cost of altruism is small anyway. It can explain why people vote. Here the expense is small anyway.

Still there seems to be some factors that are even bigger.

Let's take a look at people that die for their ideology. Christian martyrs, Muslim suicide bombers, or Communist guerilla fighters. They seem to get so little and well, die.

And that's pretty common. It seems pretty easy for a leader or pedagogue to rouse men to be soldiers. Of course, becoming a soldier is a pretty shitty job, yet most men don't mind.

These people make a huge sacrifice for the sake of their country, ideology, or people that are not even genetically related to them.

Why?

It is only sustainable in a system where the cost/benefit ratio is less than the reputation benefit of the act.  It sounds as if this is only good for public acts but if the benefit is transferred to a social entity that outlasts the individual (like your children, a relative's children, a religion or a corporation say), the result could still hold.  

If you think about typical morality/ethics really it still makes sense to think that what we call altruism must still have a net positive benefit.  If there is no benefit long term or to anyone, it really isn't useful or even good, its random.  What we usually call altruism is usually some sort of reciprocal cooperation.  

A soldier who dies in combat or someone who dies for their beliefs but everyone knows about it as a public statement benefits from their act indirectly.  I don't think its altruism in the pure sense of the word. Defending the nation, ones' beliefs or whatever is, in its sense its own reward.

A martyr with no family at all who would benefit would still count as an altruism I think, but most acts of public piety and sacrifice do benefit the individual by reputation. Something to think about.

1063,1063,1673,How does multitasking work,"I am completely clueless about the inner workings of an operating system, but I can more or less guess the approximate behaviour of many functions. One thing that I am not able to figure out, though, is multitasking.

In theory, the operating system manages time, according the CPU for small intervals to the various programs running. But it is not clear how this really works.

Say the operating system wants to start my program. The machine code is loaded somewhere in RAM, starting at a certain address. I guess then a jump should be performed to that address, allowing my code to execute. But in this way, the OS cannot regain control until I jump back.

Basically, I can imagine just two ways of making this work, but neither seems really suitable:


The operating system could read the machine instructions I want to perform and emulate them instead of executing them directly. I am intentionally vague, since I do not know how this would work, but it seems like it would slow down the program considerably.
Alternatively, the operating system could wait until I make a system call. In that moment it regains control and can check how long I have been running and do its timesharing stuff. This may work, but it seems unreliable, as I could make a long calculation which does not involve system calls and hang everything for a while.


So, it seems neither mechanism would work very well. How is multitasking actually performed?
",Andrea,https://programmers.stackexchange.com/users/15072,"The OS programs a timer to kick in every few microseconds (or milliseconds, depending on system speed). This timer raises the hardware interrupt, which causes the CPU to stop whatever it is currently doing, dump all its contents onto the stack and process the interrupt routine indicated by the address provided by the interrupt controller. This routine can inspect the stack and various other variables to make a decision which running process should next be put back into action. If it's the same process, the interrupt routine simply returns. If it's a different one, the relevant parts of the stack are saved and then replaced  with the contents of a previously interrupted process, so when the interrupt routine returns, that process continues. Other than the fact that some time has elapsed, that process is unaware of having been interrupted and/or paused for some time.

This is (for modern CPUs) a VERY VERY simplified version of what happens, but it explains the principle. In addition to these OS controlled interrupts, there are also interrupts caused by external events (mouse, keyboard, serial ports, network ports, etc.) which are process with separate interrupt routines, which are usually connected to event handlers.

Very often process/task/context switching is also based on availability of external resources. Typically a process that requires data from storage (i.e. not in RAM) will place the request on a queue, set an event handler for the hardware interrupt indicating that the request has been served and then relinquish control to the task scheduler (since there is no point in waiting).

5571,5571,8848,IPython Qt Console doesn't have a title in GNOME app switcher,"  

When I use the app switcher in GNOME 3.16, the IPython Qt Console (version 3.1.0) doesn't have a title under its icon (see image, and compare with Chromium). I also noticed that the icon doesn't have a title in the GNOME dock, nor is it present in the GNOME bar at the top.

I thought that maybe the title would be set in the .desktop file, but then I had a look at my /usr/share/applications/ipython-qtconsole.desktop and it doesn't look any different from other applications (i.e. it has a Name label set to an IPython value).

Is there a way to add a title manually?

There is no closed form expression for this.

The reason it is possible to do such a thing is that highly composite numbers bear some resemblance to superior highly composite numbers. S.H.C. numbers have the basic feature, nonincreasing exponents, but in addition the ratios of the exponents for distinct primes $p \neq q$ must approximate the outcome of Ramanujan's recipe.  Between consecutive S.H.C. numbers, one may find all the h.c. numbers as a sort of operations research problem. This is all, well, difficult. So it all depends on why this is important to you, and how important. The short version, meanwhile, is that you calculate the s.h.c larger than you current $a_n,$ calculate the h.c. numbers up that high, and take the smallest one that is a multiple of $a_n.$ If you need to go up an extra s.h.c number, so be it.

Note that finding the first s.h.c number which is a multiple of your fixed number $a_n$ is entirely straightforward, as for any given $p^e,$ one may find the first (largest) $\delta &gt; 0$ such that the s.h.c. number $N_\delta$ is divisible by $p^e.$ Do this for all primes that divide your fixed $a_n$ and there you have it.

I know that the radio waves are modulated to encode data and the frequency or amplitude are changed, so then the waves are propagated through the air and received at another location via a receiver that is tuned to a certain frequency that the waves were emitted, but I'm sure in most places in the world by now there are numerous amounts of waves traversing at any point, why doesn't the receiver of this device happen to catch another wave of the same frequency instead of the one that was intended? or is there anything that stops me from having a device that emits a wide range of frequencies or amplitudes that would manipulate nearby electronics?
",AlanZ2223,https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/51988,"
  why doesn't the receiver of this device happen to catch another wave of the same frequency instead of the one that was intended?


It does catch other waves at the same frequency. This is called noise. Communications are engineered so that the signal is significantly stronger than the potential noise such that it can still be reliably demodulated.

More generally, all wireless communications use the same medium (the electromagnetic field), and the problem of allowing multiple users access to this shared medium is multiplexing. While frequency division multiplexing is most common, it is not the only way: for example ultra-wideband communications may use time-division multiplexing, and spread-spectrum may use code-division multiplexing.

These methods can also be used in combination. For example, we may tune a receiver to a particular frequency (frequency-division multiplexing), and simultaneously use a directional antenna to reduce sensitivity in directions where there is only noise (space-division multiplexing). A system's ability to distinguish the desired signal from noise is called selectivity, and the more known about the desired signal (frequency, timing, phase, polarization, etc), the more selective a receiver can be.

People using radio waves are separated from each other. I know that radio waves are modulated to encode data, and the frequency or amplitude will also change, so these waves are transmitted through the air, then received by one receiver at another location, and the receiver is tuned to a certain frequency, that is, the radio waves are transmitted, but I'm sure that up to now, there are countless waves propagating at any point in most parts of the world, why this Does the device's receiver not happen to catch another wave of the same frequency, rather than a predetermined frequency? Or is there something that prevents me from having a device that can emit a wide range of frequencies or amplitudes to manipulate nearby Electronics?","
  why doesn't the receiver of this device happen to catch another wave of the same frequency instead of the one that was intended?


It does catch other waves at the same frequency. This is called noise. Communications are engineered so that the signal is significantly stronger than the potential noise such that it can still be reliably demodulated.

More generally, all wireless communications use the same medium (the electromagnetic field), and the problem of allowing multiple users access to this shared medium is multiplexing. While frequency division multiplexing is most common, it is not the only way: for example ultra-wideband communications may use time-division multiplexing, and spread-spectrum may use code-division multiplexing.

These methods can also be used in combination. For example, we may tune a receiver to a particular frequency (frequency-division multiplexing), and simultaneously use a directional antenna to reduce sensitivity in directions where there is only noise (space-division multiplexing). A system's ability to distinguish the desired signal from noise is called selectivity, and the more known about the desired signal (frequency, timing, phase, polarization, etc), the more selective a receiver can be.

4273,4273,6810,Protractor test vs long-polling,"I have an Angular web app that continuously listens for notifications from the backend via long-poll:

scope.notification = $resource('/notification').get();


This request never completes in the test environment. This is a problem for Protractor, because it wants to wait for all outstanding HTTP requests to finish.

I see a number of potential solutions, but have some issues with all of them.

I do not see a way to tell Protractor to ignore this request. Issuing it from $interval (which itself is ignored) is not a solution. Protractor will not wait for the request to be sent, but once it's sent, it will still wait for it to complete.

So I'm trying not to send this request when running the tests. But how do I know I'm in a test?


I could add a flag to the URL (?protractor=true). But my web app modifies the URL all the time, so it would get cleared quickly.
I tried setting a variable: browser.executeScript('window.runningProtractorTests = true;'); But it seems Protractor will wait for the page to sync first before running executeScript. And I'm sending the request right away when the page loads.
I could set a cookie. But it's fairly cumbersome, e.g. I'd have to load the page twice. (See issue 341 for more difficulties.)
I could set a user agent. It's not easy either. I would need to set browser flags for each browser in the config file. I do not want to completely override the user agent (to Protractor, for example) out of fear that my libraries may rely on interpreting the user agent string, so I'd have to figure out the right string.
I could check if the server is running on a specific port. But then a year from now someone will try to run the production server on the same port and not understand why the notifications don't work.
Making the test backend complete the request immediately does not help, because it's immediately sent again whenever it completes. But I guess I could introduce a special ""you are in a test"" notification and stop the polling when this is received. This would mean a (small) change to our protocol, so I'd rather avoid it if possible.


Is there no straightforward way to do this?

773,773,1222,Is it ethical to profit by having my students buy my textbook?,"This question was suggested to me by How can I sell my text book to my students in e-book format? which asked about the practicalities, but attracted many comments about the ethics.  So this question is to ask about the ethics directly.

Suppose I have written and published a textbook, and I want to use it as the text for a course I am teaching.  I receive royalties from each copy of my book that is sold, so if my students are required to buy my textbook for the course, I will make some money.  Is it ethical to do so?

Well-reasoned opinions would be useful answers, but even more useful would be pointers to institutional policies, professional codes of ethics, etc, that address this issue.

Of course, there are many ways to avoid profiting from the sale of my book to my students.  If my contract with my publisher allows it, I could distribute PDFs to my students, or have the university bookstore print out copies and sell them at cost.  Another approach I've heard of is to compute how much I earn in royalties on each copy, and refund that amount from my pocket to each student who buys a copy.  Or, use my royalty earnings to buy pizza for the class.  Certainly these are nice gestures, but I would like opinions on whether they are ethically required.

Edit: To address some questions that have arisen in the comments:


This question is hypothetical.  I haven't published any textbooks myself and have no immediate plans to do so.  In any case, my personal preference would be to make the book available to students for free, if at all possible.  So I've phrased this question in the first person for rhetorical convenience only.
I had intended the question to be only about the potential financial conflict of interest that could arise if I make money by assigning my own book.  Some of the answers feel that it is improper for me to assign my own textbook at all, whether I make money or not, but I don't think this point of view is prevalent within the academic community.  If it happens that my book (as a pithy but now-deleted comment put it) ""blows"", I think most would agree that my decision to assign it is pedagogically unfortunate, but not unethical.  
I don't literally mean that students would be required to buy the book, only that they'd be expected to have it.  I might assign readings or homework problems from the book, so that the student needs access to the book in order to do them, but they could certainly achieve this by getting a used copy or borrowing from a friend.  But probably most students would buy new copies anyway, since that is the most convenient way.

",Nate Eldredge,https://academia.stackexchange.com/users/1010,"This is an interesting question but it involves much more than just ethics and financial considerations. It is also a matter of tradition versus more modern thinking about free material.

To write materials for your own course or on your research field is quite natural. For obvious reasons such books will suit their purpose best.

I think many would dream of having tailored reading materials in their courses; few have the opportunity to spend the time writing it. In many, if not most, university systems no-one will pay you for writing it so it will be done on your free time.

I'm specifically wondering about brute force attacks. Based on my experiences with John The Ripper, I doubt that repeating a pattern in a password would shorten the time to successfully brute force a password like f00B@rf00B@rf00B@r as opposed to a random string of equal length. However, my doubt is based on the fact that, according to the documentation, JTR does not include a specific attack mode for repeating patterns. JTR, and presumably other brute force tools, can be customized for any arbitrary attack mode. But we can't know how often attackers bother to customize attacks in this way. So then the question becomes mathematical. Please forgive the awkward pseudo mathematical notation. 

T = brute force cracking time

PL = pattern of characters of length L

N = number of times PL is repeated

R(LN) = string of random characters of length (L times N)

The site returns to normal immediately after disabling compilation but I'd really like to have the performance benefits. Does anyone know how to fix this?
",David Perry,https://magento.stackexchange.com/users/2075,"It sounds like one of your extensions, or some custom code in your system, is incompatible with Magento's compilation mode.  The exact solution will vary depending on your PHP system.  Here's an explanation of the problem and some troubleshooting tips that should help you.

A file in your system contains a line that looks something like this

//the string 'ConfigFileManager-Model.php' may be 
//a constant or variable as well

require_once 'ConfigFileManager-Model.php';


The file ConfigFileManager-Model.php is not part of Magento, or any publicly distributed package as far as I can tell.    

It sounds like when you're running in ""non-compiled mode"", Magento can find this file without issue.  That means it's somewhere in the normal Magento include paths

/path/to/magento/app/code/core/ConfigFileManager-Model.php    
/path/to/magento/app/code/community/ConfigFileManager-Model.php
/path/to/magento/app/code/local/ConfigFileManager-Model.php
/path/to/magento/path/to/calling/files/own/folder/ConfigFileManager-Model.php

#possibly more, depending on your system's default include path


However, when Magento runs in compiled mode, the core, local, and community code pool paths are not added as include paths.  Only the folder

/path/to/magento/includes/src


is added as an include path.  Additionally, what compilation mode does is make copies of all the class files and drops them into the includes/src folder.  That means the file's own original folder is no longer in the include path.  Because of this, when Magento runs the require code in compilation mode, it can't find the ConfigFileManager-Model.php file, and fails.

The best thing to do would be recode the module and/or custom code such that the functionality of ConfigFileManager-Model.php is incorporated into a standard Magento helper of model class.

The less good, but quicker thing would be to identify all the places ConfigFileManager-Model.php is required and change the path so it's absolute instead of relative.

I find that index.php causes the following errors in the log many times:","It sounds like one of your extensions, or some custom code in your system, is incompatible with Magento's compilation mode.  The exact solution will vary depending on your PHP system.  Here's an explanation of the problem and some troubleshooting tips that should help you.

A file in your system contains a line that looks something like this

//the string 'ConfigFileManager-Model.php' may be 
//a constant or variable as well

require_once 'ConfigFileManager-Model.php';


The file ConfigFileManager-Model.php is not part of Magento, or any publicly distributed package as far as I can tell.    

It sounds like when you're running in ""non-compiled mode"", Magento can find this file without issue.  That means it's somewhere in the normal Magento include paths

/path/to/magento/app/code/core/ConfigFileManager-Model.php    
/path/to/magento/app/code/community/ConfigFileManager-Model.php
/path/to/magento/app/code/local/ConfigFileManager-Model.php
/path/to/magento/path/to/calling/files/own/folder/ConfigFileManager-Model.php

#possibly more, depending on your system's default include path


However, when Magento runs in compiled mode, the core, local, and community code pool paths are not added as include paths.  Only the folder

/path/to/magento/includes/src


is added as an include path.  Additionally, what compilation mode does is make copies of all the class files and drops them into the includes/src folder.  That means the file's own original folder is no longer in the include path.  Because of this, when Magento runs the require code in compilation mode, it can't find the ConfigFileManager-Model.php file, and fails.

The best thing to do would be recode the module and/or custom code such that the functionality of ConfigFileManager-Model.php is incorporated into a standard Magento helper of model class.

The less good, but quicker thing would be to identify all the places ConfigFileManager-Model.php is required and change the path so it's absolute instead of relative.

2741,2741,4371,"Are there English equivalents to the Japanese saying, “There’s a god who puts you down as well as a god who picks you up”?","There is an old Japanese saying, “捨てる神あれば、拾う神あり-Suterukami areba hirou kami ari,” meaning “There’s a god who puts you down as well as a god who picks up you.” In other words, “In this world, some people help you, and some people harm you” or “Fortune and misfortune come alternately.”

For example, when you are fired from an IT company, and then hired by its rival company with a higher salary three months later, your peers will say to you “You're a lucky man. There’s a god who throws you away as well as a god who picks you up.”

I’m curious to know if there are similar sayings in English to “Suterukami areba hirou kami ari.” 
",Yoichi Oishi,https://english.stackexchange.com/users/3119,"To translate this expression, you need to cope with the very different attitudes towards divinity of Japanese and 'Western' culture. When a Japanese expression talks about the kami, it's in a different atmosphere than when an English expression talks about God.

There are many kami, they come and go. The Japanese expression suggests that there are many powers in the world and that different ones are influential at different times.

The monotheistic view is very different: there's one deity. It's very different for the one and only deity to dish out varying results than for random encounters with different kami to result in different outcomes.

Thus, you might want to stick to expressions that don't involve God, but rather talk about fate, or luck, or use the passive. I think you're better off avoiding divinity altogether, as you lose a lot more translation quality by referencing the very different divinity than you gain by maintaining the reference to divinity at all.

3017,3017,4810,Kernel density estimation across multiple UTM zones,"I'm trying to compare the spatial distribution between two groups of fishing locations (for each of several different years) in the Bering Sea (lat's ~53 to 65N, long's ~ -178 to -158W. My preliminary explorations have used kernel density estimation (with an unconstrained plug-in bandwidth matrix) and then examined different overlap indices of their home ranges (quantified via utilization distribution overlap index and Bhattacharyya's Affinity) to compare similarities/differences (all performed in R). 

However, I'm concerned about the interpretation of these data when the data may span more than one UTM zone. Most of my data are in UTM zone 3 with some data points seeping into zone 4. In more extreme cases, my data may span from zone 1 to 4. 

Am I being really ignorant in thinking that I can compare across zone boundaries? 
Since I am interested only in relative differences between calculations with the same distortion, will it not matter? 
Should I simply make sure that I have my UTM origin set at the southwesterly most point of the data and I'm fine from there?
I've been reading StackExchange and other sites all morning and have seen several discussions about measuring across UTM zones, but I haven't been able to logically extend such responses to a method such as this one.

1712,1712,2711,Is it possible to Cap a GridFS collection?,"I'm trying to store my application results in a mongo database.  There are some issues to this, first we generate a lot of data because it is raw image files, up to 50MB per record and 5 records per second at full speed, that's worst case though not typical. This isn't a problem using gridFS. In the mongod.cfg we are using directoryPerDB: true and I create a symlink for the Results database folder to a dedicated SSD where all the results database is kept.  All the settings data is kept in a couple different databases on the OS drive, and the results data has a dedicated drive. This is all working great for our application.

My problem is filling up the results disk. I need to basically have a capped collection to a max size, and then delete only the oldest files.  But I don't see a way to do this with gridFS? Is there a setting  or something I'm missing that would allow capping this?  

I found this answer GridFS disk management but that seems to apply to mongod, and i don't think you can set a quota per database as the Results database is the only one I need to be limited.  

At this point I guess i will write a task that cleans the oldest files out periodically if the total is over a threshold limit, i'm just afraid this is not going to be very efficient.  Are there any recommendations on the best way to handle this?  
",trashrobber,https://stackoverflow.com/users/480819,"To make a long story short: you can not cap GridFS in a useful way. Here is why:

When you store a file in GridFS, it is split into chunks of 255kB, by default in a collection named fs.chunks, which absolutely can be capped by doing

db.createCollection(""fs.chunks"",{capped:true, size:52428800})


The capping would apply to those chunks, which are individual documents. So when you add a file which would make the fs.chunks to exceed its cap, only chunks of the oldest files would be removed. Another problem would be that the files metadata, which is stored in fs.files by default, would not be updated, leaving stale entries in fs.files for which no entries in fs.chunks are present any more, or – worse – only a fraction of the chunks are still present.

There are ways to overcome this (checking if the size in bytes of the chunks combined equals the length field of the fs.files document of the respective file, for example), but they are at least as complicated (and much slower!) as doing a check pre-insert wether the collection would exceed the threshold using the collections stats and delete as many of the oldest files as needed to fit the new file in without exceeding the threshold. 

The latter, by the way, is my suggestion on how to solve your problem.

Another solution would be to use a dedicated instance with the limitations applied in my answer to the question you mentioned.

",Anna,https://boardgames.stackexchange.com/users/3173,"As commenters have pointed out, the copying that you are describing is illegal in most countries.

This isn't legal advice (and it depends on where you're located), but a quick Google search about copying and protecting card games seems to suggest that you probably can make a copy if you don't directly copy the artwork or wording used in the original game. It sounds like you can write out the rules in your own words, and make your own cards. Of course, some would say this is ethically questionable. And who knows what the issues are if the game mechanics are patented in some way.


  (Don't worry, of course I'll mail a fit donation to the manufacturers.)

This isn't legal advice (and it depends on where you're located), but a quick Google search about copying and protecting card games seems to suggest that you probably can make a copy if you don't directly copy the artwork or wording used in the original game. It sounds like you can write out the rules in your own words, and make your own cards. Of course, some would say this is ethically questionable. And who knows what the issues are if the game mechanics are patented in some way.

2978,2978,4737,What are the benefits of owning a physical book?,"I have seen this question about updates of the D&amp;D 4th Edition books, and it got me thinking.
Since I got my Kindle I have not read a single paper novel; they have fewer drawbacks compared to digital copies than rpg rulebooks.


Dead-tree types have some benefits like looking good on a bookshelf, but any ebook reader weighs less with 100 novels than the usual hard-cover book. 
If you want to look for the damage of Ares Alpha, even with a half-decent tablet it takes less than 2 seconds.  
Digital copies do not get worn, they never get unwanted earmarks, but you can bookmark them.
Rulebooks do get updates, and unless you are willing to take a pen to your book, your hard copies will never contain them. The pdfs can be edited and resent to the buyers. 
Even better is the WotC approach with the DDI, you can look up any monster or item or (almost any) rule, in the most recent form, for 3 years at the cost of seven books. 


I think this is the way to go, even considering the horribly slow character builder. Although I must admit good illustration can help build the athmosphere.

So what am I missing? Why are people buying rpg rulebooks in paper format? Why are books even published, I do not need to know if feats are supposed to be on the right page and skills on the left, I just want a list of them, filterable any way I want. 

Is this just a necessary part of earning money? I understand that pdfs are copied illegally, but the Compendium is not.

642,642,1015,"How to determine if a matrix is positive/negative definite, having complex eigenvalues?","I am trying to deal with an issue: I am trying to determine the nature of some points, that's why I need to check in Matlab if a matrix with complex elements is positive or negative definite. After performing some research, I came to the following two methods:


Calculate the eigenvalues and see if it is positive/negative;

    eig(matrix)


If the eigenvalues are positive => matrix is positive definite;
Else, if eigenvalues are negative => matrix is negative definite;
Use the following function:

    [R P] = chol(matrix)


If p is 0 => you have a positive definite matrix; otherwise, your matrix is NOT positive definite.


My problem is that I have two complex eigenvalues (and  my symmetric matrix has complex elements), therefore, method 1 doesn't help me to draw any conclusion. And the method 2, doesn't give me information whether the matrix is negative definite or indefinite, because it tests only if the matrix is positive definite or not, therefore, doesn't solve my problem.

Does any one have any idea how I can check if a matrix with complex eigenvalues is positive or negative definite with other methods than the mentioned ones? Thank you.

LATER EDIT:

My function is: 11.*x1 + 22.*x1.^2.*x2 + x2.^2 + 31.*x1.^2;

I have done the partial derivative with respect to x1, x2 and I have equalized all the obtained relations with 0. Therefore, I have obtained the following system:

62*x1 + 44*x1*x2 + 11 = 0

22*x1^2 + 2*x2 = 0

from here, I got x1 having the following possible values: 
{0.333, -0.1025 + 0.2403i, -0.1025 - 0.2403i} 
and x2 having the following values: 
{-1.22, 0.5197 + 0.5417i,  0.5197 - 0.5417i}

My Hessian looks something like:

( 62+44*x2                 44*x1)

( 44*x1                    2    )

After taking the 3 possible pairs of (x1,x2) I obtain three values for the Hessian matrix. For the first (x1,x2) pair everything is ok => I have a saddle, since I have 2 real eigenvalues of opposite signs. The difficulties comes with the others, because intuitively I would say that we cannot determine the nature of those points, but I came across to the following idea, while surfing the internet for finding an explanation:

-if A belongs to Mn(C) and 

1) Re(x_star * A * x) > 0 => A positive definite.

2) Re(x_star * A * x) &lt; 0 => A negative definite.

(according to http://mathworld.wolfram.com/PositiveDefiniteMatrix.html)

So, I am a bit confused :-?

24/08/2013 Update

Inspired by the answer of Jim, will a circuit like this one work?


",Pat,https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/27887,"Normally I wouldn't do a bespoke design (especially for free) but this problem has a lot of common themes with other questions being asked so I thought it would be a good exercise to go through it in the hope that my solution (or parts of it) could be used elsewhere. Apologies for its length. MOSFET types should be able to switch a few amps and be of the 'digital' type (low gate turn on voltages).

Problems:

(1) the solenoid valve requires a positive pulse and a negative pulse (of about 30mS) to open an close it. 

(2) the sensor outputs a single pulse of about 60 seconds.

(3) the Pump requires a 3v6 pulse at about 500mA

Assumptions:

(1) the pump valve stays ON or OFF depending on the last pulse

(2) You want to turn the valve ON at the beginning of the sensor pulse and OFF at the end.

I noticed the valve has only two wires so rather than positive and negative pulses its more reversing current direction. For a single supply that would suggest some form of changeover switch or an H bridge. I chose to go with a MOSFET H bridge and worked out from there.

The circuit:



THE H BRIDGE: Q3,Q4,Q5,Q6

MOSFETs Q3,Q4,Q5,Q6 and Diodes D1,D2,D3 and D4 form a fairly conventional H Bridge using P channel MOSFETS at the top and N channel at the bottom. IC1d is a CMOS schmitt inverter gate that switches the opposite sides of the bridge. A LOW on the gate turns  Q3 ON  and turns Q4 OFF. The inverter output (HIGH) turns ON Q6  and turns Q5 OFF. Current direction will be left to right through the valve (current forward). 

A HIGH on the Q4 MOSFET gate turns it Q4 ON but turns Q3 OFF . The output from the inverter (LOW) turns Q5 ON and turns Q6 OFF. The output current direction is now right to left. (Current reversed).

CURRENT PULSE POWER CONTROL: (Q1,Q2)

If the H bridge was powered all the time the valve would burn out. 

Q1 is normally held OFF by R1. This part of the circuit only allows the H Bridge to work when it is Q1 is turned ON. 

When the gate of Q2 is taken HIGH by the 30mS pulse it switches ON and pulls the gate of Q1 to ground, turning it ON as well. When the pulse returns to LOW it is turned OFF

TIMING CIRCUIT: (R3,C1, IC1b, IC1c and IC2a)

I could have used a simple 8 pin micro-controller for this section but chose to do it with with a few simple logic gates.

IC1a acts simply as an inverting buffer taking the 60 second pulse at its input. 

One of the inputs to the XOR gate is taken through a simple RC delay circuit (R3, C1). When there is a change in the state (HIGH-> LOW or LOW->HIGH) of the incoming pulse this RC delay will cause the output of the XOR gate to go HIGH for the delay period. (Dual edge triggered monostable)

Eventually the two inputs of the gate will be the same and then the output of the gate will go LOW. In other words we get a pulse after the rising AND falling edges of the input signal (frequency doubler).

On the other hand, I have a pulse solenoid that closes at negative voltage (- 3.6V) and opens at positive voltage (+ 3.6V).","Normally I wouldn't do a bespoke design (especially for free) but this problem has a lot of common themes with other questions being asked so I thought it would be a good exercise to go through it in the hope that my solution (or parts of it) could be used elsewhere. Apologies for its length. MOSFET types should be able to switch a few amps and be of the 'digital' type (low gate turn on voltages).

Problems:

(1) the solenoid valve requires a positive pulse and a negative pulse (of about 30mS) to open an close it. 

(2) the sensor outputs a single pulse of about 60 seconds.

(3) the Pump requires a 3v6 pulse at about 500mA

Assumptions:

(1) the pump valve stays ON or OFF depending on the last pulse

(2) You want to turn the valve ON at the beginning of the sensor pulse and OFF at the end.

I noticed the valve has only two wires so rather than positive and negative pulses its more reversing current direction. For a single supply that would suggest some form of changeover switch or an H bridge. I chose to go with a MOSFET H bridge and worked out from there.

The circuit:



THE H BRIDGE: Q3,Q4,Q5,Q6

MOSFETs Q3,Q4,Q5,Q6 and Diodes D1,D2,D3 and D4 form a fairly conventional H Bridge using P channel MOSFETS at the top and N channel at the bottom. IC1d is a CMOS schmitt inverter gate that switches the opposite sides of the bridge. A LOW on the gate turns  Q3 ON  and turns Q4 OFF. The inverter output (HIGH) turns ON Q6  and turns Q5 OFF. Current direction will be left to right through the valve (current forward). 

A HIGH on the Q4 MOSFET gate turns it Q4 ON but turns Q3 OFF . The output from the inverter (LOW) turns Q5 ON and turns Q6 OFF. The output current direction is now right to left. (Current reversed).

CURRENT PULSE POWER CONTROL: (Q1,Q2)

If the H bridge was powered all the time the valve would burn out. 

Q1 is normally held OFF by R1. This part of the circuit only allows the H Bridge to work when it is Q1 is turned ON. 

When the gate of Q2 is taken HIGH by the 30mS pulse it switches ON and pulls the gate of Q1 to ground, turning it ON as well. When the pulse returns to LOW it is turned OFF

TIMING CIRCUIT: (R3,C1, IC1b, IC1c and IC2a)

I could have used a simple 8 pin micro-controller for this section but chose to do it with with a few simple logic gates.

IC1a acts simply as an inverting buffer taking the 60 second pulse at its input. 

One of the inputs to the XOR gate is taken through a simple RC delay circuit (R3, C1). When there is a change in the state (HIGH-> LOW or LOW->HIGH) of the incoming pulse this RC delay will cause the output of the XOR gate to go HIGH for the delay period. (Dual edge triggered monostable)

Eventually the two inputs of the gate will be the same and then the output of the gate will go LOW. In other words we get a pulse after the rising AND falling edges of the input signal (frequency doubler). If we set this delay pulse to be about 30mS it is exactly what we require for the input to Q1,Q2.  

The direction of the current passing through the bridge is controlled by the input signal as it will be HIGH (detected) or LOW (timed out) at the time of the pulse.

5325,5325,8462,SQL Agent powershell context reference,"At my new job, we have multiple named instances on each servers. 


Server1\Dev 
Server1\DevIntegrated 
Server1\QA


I have a SQL PowerShell script in the works that calls out to the OS, invokes Foo.exe but needs to pass a command line parameter (the connection string). A SQL Agent job will exist on each instance, with a step of type PowerShell, that needs to know what the current context is. i.e. This execution began on DevIntegrated. 

I have no desire to have every script start with 

$thisInstance = ""Dev""


eespecially as I'd have to edit that as we migrate to environments (new servers and named instances) in the upcoming months.   

If I start SQLPS, I can determine my instance by slicing and dicing the results of Get-Location or running

(Invoke-Sqlcmd -Query ""SELECT @@servername AS ServerName"" -SuppressProviderContextWarning).ServerName


When the SQL Agent starts a job of type PowerShell, it starts in the C:\windows\system32 The Get-Location route doesn't work as it's not in the SQLSERVER context. I can change into that context but I'll be at the ""root"" of SQL Server and won't know what instance I should be in. Using the Invoke-Sqlcmd route won't work either for same reason (technically, it times out as there is no default instance)

To the best of my knowledge, I've enumerated all the basic ""things"" I can Get into the job log but nothing seems to show SQLSERVER:\SQL\Server1\DevIntegrated


Get-ChildItem
Get-Host
Get-Location
Get-Process
Get-PSDrive
Get-PSProvider
Get-Service
Get-TraceSource
Get-Variable


Get-Process seems like I could use that and some voodoo of trying to cobble things together by hitting the instances and matching spids but that just sounds like a bloody-hack from hell. There must be something basic that I'm missing, can anyone shed some light?

Alternatives to PowerShell investigated

I had investigated using other job types and didn't get a satisfactory resolution. Research indicated the PowerShell listed under SQL Agent was SQLPS and starting an instance of it by right clicking on the Agent automagically dropped me into the correct location. It was only when I pasted my interactive code into the job step that I learned of the difference as previously mentioned.

Job type of OS put me into an identical state in that I could not find a way to determine which instance dropped me into the command shell. Sure, I could sqlcmd and get the value of @@servername but if I knew what connection to start sqlcmd, I wouldn't need to to query the database ;)

TSQL could probably work if we enable xp cmdshell but I'm not sure if they have it turned on---government facility and they can be persnickety on non-default settings. Even then, I'm stuck futzing with dynamic SQL and losing a lot of the expressiveness and power that PowerShell lends.

While a bit ungainly, I thought defining a variable at the first step and passing that to successor steps but research turned up this article Handling Multiple Job Steps (BOL) 


""Job steps must be atomic. A job cannot pass Boolean values, data, or numeric values between job steps. You can pass values from one Transact-SQL job step to another by using permanent tables or global temporary tables. You can pass values from one CmdExec job step to another by using files.""


I can't use common tricks like a well-known file/environment variables/registry setting that Foo.exe looks for as that would prevent concurrent execution across instances.

tl;dr

In a SQL Agent Job step of type PowerShell, how can you determine the instance of SQL Server that launched the process?
",billinkc,https://dba.stackexchange.com/users/2131,"If you look in SQL Server BOL, SQL Server Agent provides a set of ""tokens"" that it will substitute into both the job step command text and the output file (the later will prevent the GUI ""view"" button from working).

4552,4552,7212,"Are DSLRs a dying breed, making now the time to switch to a mirrorless camera system?","I came across this thought provoking article on Stuck in Customs today that makes a strong case to hold off too much investment in DSLR gear, and instead switch to mirror-less cameras like the Sony NEX. The author prefers to call such cameras 3rd generation cameras to prevent any bias.

The crux of the argument lies in the smaller size and faster shooting speeds of the new cameras, while the sensor size is an area where they seem to be lacking (Sony &amp; Samsung cameras are APS-C sized though). Currently the big makers - Nikon &amp; Canon - have practically no presence in this market (Nikon seems to be doing something with the V1). However, they seem to have slowed down the introduction of new entry level DSLR models over the last year as well.

So, as DSLR users looking to build and enhance their kit (there are many like me who've jumped the bandwagon over the last couple of years, and are just starting to build their kit), what are the advantages of sticking with the DSLR system rather than switching to the 3rd gen cameras?

IMO, one point that could cause a massive switch in the DSLR base would be if Nikon &amp; Canon announced mirror-less models compatible with their current lens lineups, but that is a hypothetical scenario.

P.S. There is a similar question on mirror-less cameras, but that seems to be from the perspective of a person starting out rather than a person already invested in the DSLR system.
",ab.aditya,https://photo.stackexchange.com/users/1977,"DSLRs are certainly not going away any time soon, especially at the high end of the market - ruggedness, speed, large sensor size, and the continued availability of excellent glass will keep them around for some time. Large sensor cameras will also continue to appeal to nature photographers, as the 1.0x crop factor on the higher end models will allow them to shoot wider than APS-C, m4/3, or smaller sensored cameras, lens for lens.

That said, I believe that growth of the DSLR market will slow, perhaps even flattening, as I think there are two kinds of DSLR user - pros/enthusiasts who need specific feature sets and are willing to deal with larger size and weight, and people who want better than a point-and-shoot, who would prefer a smaller camera and get some of the benefits of a larger one (APS-C sensors, for example).

It's the latter group who will poach market share from both the DSLR and point-and-shoot market segments. Neither will be destroyed, but I believe both will lose some share.

As for me, I'm a long time SLR user, who's taking the plunge, selling his Nikon bodies and lenses, and going mirrorless (X-Pro1 when it drops).

Whenever I try to burn more than 3.8GB (approaching the 4 GB limit) of data onto a DVD, burning fails, aborts, or gives an ""error 254.""

I have lost more than 50 DVDs this way until I learned about the 3.8GB limit. Anything under 3.8GB burns fine, and DVDs burned with more than 3.8GB have usable data up to 3.8 GB, but then the remaining data is garbled, unaccessible, or the disk is just not recognized.

I'm pretty certain this is related to the replacement of cdrecord / mkisofs with wodim /genioimage (which is a problem that has been described for years). Is there another answer or fix? Re-installing cdrtools/cdrecord/mkisofs in Oneiric and Precise has become a herculean task.

5886,5886,9322,Voltage ratings of capacitors: ceramic vs electrolytic,"Now I know when it comes to electrolytic capacitors it's usually good practice to use a voltage rating 1.5x - 2.5x the maximum rating you ever expect the capacitor to be exposed to, as the lifetime can be significantly reduced by running it near its limits.

But does the same protocol apply to ceramic capacitors? For example, assume a 25V ceramic capacitor - will running it at 24V reduce its lifespan significantly?

I'm currently designing a PSU which needs to be reliable, so at the moment I'm using 50V caps for a maximum 20V input (35V caps aren't available), but I'd like to switch to 25V caps if possible.

Mainly because electrolytic values are more approximate, and their value much more temperature dependant than ceramic, polycarbonates or tantalum. Note: Tantalum are very voltage sensitive.

You answer is that I would also use a 50V cap for a 20V supply, in fact if you glance at the charge curve for electrolytics you will notice that they work better (more farads) at about 1/3 of their rating anyway. As for being for different purpose, you will get heating in an electrolytic if you allow it to completely charge and discharge on a cycle, for instance using a 220uF to service a 10 amp load on a rectifier will tax the cap and cause heating in the leads, and as the other answers alread indicate, heating equals less farads.

1609,1609,2527,How are pixels actually shown on display,"I spend a lot of time looking at raw-video in YCbCr-format.
Started thinking about what is really shown on the display and how
the pixels end up there.

No display can handle YCbCr-data so I guess everything gets converted
to RGB somewhere. YCbCr->RGB is however tricky business, see e.g.
http://www.fourcc.org/fccyvrgb.php

If I do the YCbCr- to RGB-conversion, am I guaranteed that the
pixel-values I have are the ones being displayed?

Short of getting a hardware-calibrated Eizo-display like the ones
shown here:

http://www.eizo.com/global/products/coloredge/



is there a way to have as much control as possible over the
""pipeline"" to the display (i.e. my pixels do not get converted on the
way) I'm thinking perhaps nvidia/gpu/opengl and moving everything as
close to the HW as possible; then for my graphic-card at least I know
what I'm looking at.

Is there a RGB-format that is native for graphics card and that doesn't require any further conversion? YCbCr is 8bpp and I'm thinking 32-bit RGB 4:4:4. 

I'm mainly on an linux-system if that makes a difference.
Currently I'm using http://www.libsdl.org/
There's also http://directfb.org/ but I haven't explored that path
yet.

Or, perhaps all this is just stupid and paranoid :-)

  No display can handle YCbCr-data so I guess everything gets converted to RGB somewhere.


All displays use RGB. On LCDs each pixel consists of three subpixels in three basic colors. So you're right, everything must be converted to RGB to be displayed.


  If I do the YCbCr- to RGB-conversion, am I guaranteed that the pixel-values I have are the ones being displayed?


It depends what you mean. You are guaranteed that exact results of the conversion are displayed. So it depends on the results of conversion and those depend on the gamma you're using.


  is there a way to have as much control as possible over the ""pipeline"" to the display (i.e. my pixels do not get converted on the way) I'm thinking perhaps nvidia/gpu/opengl and moving everything as close to the HW as possible; then for my graphic-card at least I know what I'm looking at.


Once the image is converted to RGB, it's not modified anymore (unless you use f.lux or similar software). It doesn't really matter if it's closer to hardware or not, it's just a bunch of pixels and nothing will modify them after conversion to RGB (unless you ask something to, like with the mentioned f.lux, color correction software or video editing programs that can apply color filters).


  YCbCr is 8bpp and I'm thinking 32-bit RGB 4:4:4.


I think you're mixing few things up or I don't get what you mean. First, 32-bit RGB can't be 4:4:4, because you can't equally split 32 bits to 3 color channels. (10 bits for R, 11 bits for G, 11 bits for B?) 32-bit RGB actually consists of three 8-bit color channels and one 8-bit transparency channel. Videos don't have transparency, so they work with 24-bit RGB. (8 bits for each channel)

I don't know how YCbCr is saved in digital format, but I'm sure it's not 8-bit, at least assuming we're talking about total size of a pixel. (if you mean 8-bit color channels, then it's exactly as much as in RGB) 8-bit pixels could hold up to 256 colors. 24-bit RGB is over 16 million colors.


  Is there a RGB-format that is native for graphics card and that doesn't require any further conversion?


So you want raw, uncompressed RGB pixels? Well, there are such picture and video formats, but uncompressed videos take up really A LOT of space. Let's do a quick calculation for a 24-bit 24fps 1080p video:

3B * 1920px * 1080px * 24fps = 149299200B


So every second of raw uncompressed 1080p video weights over 140 MB. It means you could have up to 5 and a half minute of video on an industry-standard Blu-Ray disc. Not really a good deal I think ;)

3610,3610,5763,The Rademacher functions for counting binary digits,"In the probability space $((0,1),{\cal B}(0,1), \lambda)$, we define the Rademacher functions as:
$R_n(\omega)=\displaystyle\sum_{k=0}^{2^n-1}(-1)^{k+1}I_{\Delta_{k,n}}(\omega)$, where  

$(0,1)=\displaystyle\bigcup_{k=0}^{2^n-1}\Delta_{k,n}$  

$\Delta_{k,n}=\left(\dfrac{k}{2^n},\dfrac{k+1}{2^n}\right]$, for $k=0,1,\dots2^n-2$
and
$\Delta_{2^n-1,n}=\left(1-\dfrac{1}{2^n},1\right)$  

I know that if $\omega\in(0,1)$ and $\omega=\displaystyle\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\dfrac{x_n}{2^n}$ is the binary representation of $\omega$, then: $R_n(\omega)=-1\ \Longleftrightarrow\ $the $n^{th}$ binary digit of $\omega$ is 0 (i.e. $x_n=0$)   $(I)$
and
$R_n(\omega)=1\ \Longleftrightarrow\ $the $n^{th}$ binary digit of $\omega$ is 1 (i.e. $x_n=1$)   $(II)$.  

Some prefer this as the definition of the Rademacher functions.
I would like to know why these two definitions are equivalent, that is why the equivalences $(I)$ and $(II)$ hold. Intuitively I understand it, but I can't seem to write it down as a rigorous mathematical proof.  

Thanks in advance!  

EDIT:
I corrected the $\Delta_{k,n}$ sets. As it was, it wasn't a proper partition of $(0,1)$ (some elements were not included - the right endpoints of the $\Delta_{k,n}$'s).
",Nick Papadopoulos,https://math.stackexchange.com/users/50118,"The fact that $R_n(\omega)=1$ means that $\omega$ belongs to $\Delta_{k,n}$ for some odd integer $k$.

Since $0\leqslant k\lt2^n$, $0\leqslant\ell\lt2^{n-1}$ and $\ell$ is a binary integer $\ell=\sum\limits_{i=0}^{n-2}\ell_i2^i$ with $\ell_i=0$ or $\ell_i=1$. Thus,

Now in the second table, i want to match the invoice with the pack size and brand from first table and put the quantity in the empty cell

So the row that is highlighted in table 2 will show the value 3 cause invoice T1411031400114, pack size 200, brand coca-cola has Qty as 3.

I was thinking of using nested VLOOKUP but cant get the correct formula for it.

Any help will be appreciated.

Regards

ADDITIONAL INFO

I've recently noticed that when this ""running water"" sound occurs that it is more prominent when the engine is running faster (e.g. during acceleration).  This leads me to believe maybe this has something to do with the water pump, or some other liquid pump, that is run by the engine and not moving enough liquid to fill the pipe, hence a sloshing / running water sound.

Is there a way that I can chain the result of the resolve / reject and end up with something like this:

I've seen some implementations of promises that allow this - returning a promise within 'then', means that the eventual result of the promise is used. 

I realise this doesn't work at the moment (the result is the promise, rather than the result of the promise), but hopefully someone can suggest a way to make this work so I can tidy up the sometimes confusing mess of the first example.

I hope this makes sense. Thanks.

4589,4589,7271,Scatterplots for subsets of multivariate data [Updated],"Update/Re-write

There has been a lot of ambiguity over what i'm am trying to do with this question so I have decided to give it a full rewrite. I'm really sorry for the confusion. If you want to see the background please see the edit history. I hope things are clearer now..

I have some data made up into the following fashion:

datac =
  {
   data1 = RandomReal[1, {7, 3}],
   data2 = RandomReal[1, {13, 3}],
   data3 = RandomReal[1, {19, 3}],
   data4 = RandomReal[1, {16, 3}],
   data5 = RandomReal[1, {5, 3}]
   };


data1 through data5 are subsets of a multivariate dataset with 3 independent variables. data1, for example, is composed of 7 individual data points (each with 3 variables).

If I use the following function: 

Needs[""StatisticalPlots`""]
pairwisecol[data_, col_] := 
PairwiseScatterPlot[data, 
                      PlotStyle -&gt; col, 
                      DataTicks -&gt; True,  
                      DataLabels -&gt; {""x"", ""y"", ""z""}]


I can create a combined plot comparing the various subsets. E.g.

Show[{pairwisecol[data1, Red], 
      pairwisecol[data2, Blue], 
      pairwisecol[data3, Green],  
      pairwisecol[data4, Purple], 
      pairwisecol[data5, Orange]}]




This curently has the major drawbacks that each subset has to be defined and have a colour explicitly assigned to it. Also, Show in this instance overlays all of the DataTicks etc, rather than just the elements from the first plot (as is normally the case with Show[{Plot1,Plot2}]).

What I'm looking for is a way to use the whole (partitioned) dataset datac to generate such a plot/diagram. i.e. something like,

Show[pairwisecol[#, Red] &amp; /@ datac]


but, with Red being replaced by a series of colours to represent each subset (like in the plot shown).

...Alternatively, starting with a 2-level list e.g.

datap = RandomReal[1, {60, 3}];


and a definition of sublist partitions,

parts = {7, 13, 19, 16, 5};


or

partspos = {[[1;;7]], [[8;;20]], [[21;;39]], [[40;;55]], [[56;;60]]};


then defining a function something like:

pairwiseP[data_, partlist_] := ...


that would partition datap into appropriate sublists, create a series of PairwiseScatterPlot's (each with a different plot colour) and then combine them using Show. 

Note that this example has n = 3 independent variables. I am looking for a method that works for 1 &lt; n &lt; ~20.

Can anyone suggest how to do this?

Regarding dependency injection: DI containers are not needed for most applications.  Unless your application is a large, enterprise-type application, you don't need a DI container, and if you do need one, there are a number of containers already available that would serve the purpose well.

Can you maintain the tool that you are buying (even if it's open-source)?  Is there adequate support for it, if you run into a problem?

Regarding dependency injection: DI containers are not needed for most applications.  Unless your application is a large, enterprise-type application, you don't need a DI container, and if you do need one, there are a number of containers already available that would serve the purpose well.

",Kasperi,https://webmasters.stackexchange.com/users/41699,"It appears that you're worried that serving different content to mobile users than to desktop users at the same URL, using user-agent detection, might be considered a form of cloaking, and thus penalized by Google.

According to the Google Webmaster Central Blog, this is not the case, provided that you do the mobile browser detection properly.  Essentially, the important detail to realize is that Google's crawlers use different user-agent strings depending on whether they expect desktop or mobile content.  For example, a typical user-agent string for normal Googlebot requests would be:

Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; Googlebot/2.1; +http://www.google.com/bot.html)

3202,3202,5103,Multiple orders in a single list,"I have a problem with a ranking system I am using.

Scenario:

An online game with around 10k players calculates a real time ranking of points when a certain event occurs. Events don't occur that often, around 1 time per minute. This ranking is kept in the cache for quick calculations, sorting and access.

Now players can form groups and play against each other, but the scoring system is the same, only the ranking is based for the players in that group.

At first I created for every group a separate ranking, effectively having the same scores as the complete ranking, but with different positions in the ranking.

This is trivial because there are over 1.000 groups and every time an event occurs all the groups would have to be updated.

So what I did now is when the group ranking is requested take only the players that are in that group from the complete ranking and show them. The positions would have to be re-counted.

That re-counting is where the problem is. Because the sub-list is by-reference from the complete ranking list I cannot change the position of the player in the sub-ranking without updating it in the complete ranking, because it's just a reference.

I came up with two solutions:


Create a copy from the record every time it is requested and do some output caching (not very desirable because the rankings are live)
Create a copy and store this in a cache which is reset when an event occurs.
Create a sub-list with just the positions which is updated when an event occurs.


And the last solution: do the position counting in the output instead in the business side. This would be the best solution, only problem is that on some pages this text appears: ""You are on position # in the ranking"" where # is your ranking position. This number would be tedious to get then.

Does anybody have any suggestions to this problem?
",YesMan85,https://programmers.stackexchange.com/users/24248,"There may be minor performance considerations involved with it, but this sounds like the sort of thing LINQ is very useful for. The basic idea is this:

var enormousList = new List&lt;record&gt;();

//var enormousList = ... (over 5 million records)
var subList = enormousList.Where(onerecord =&gt; onerecord.clanName == ""RAGIN CAJUN"");

// At this point in the program, NO filtration has occurred just yet and little processing
// power has been used.

// This enumerates the list once for the ""ragin cajun"" filter, so this may take a while.
var sublistCount = subList.Count(); //take note that Count is a function here, not a property. 
var pageSize = 50;
var hudDisplayPage = enormousList.Take(pageSize).Select((record, idx) =&gt;
{
    return new HudPage(idx, record.clanName, record.playerName);
});
// for those who couldn't keep track; hudDisplayPage is now an IEnumerable (which you can use for-each on) containing
// 50 records of the list fitting the description. These are dynamic constructs; even now, hudDisplayPage hasn't
// yet been evaluated. If you want to cache one of these values so you're not doing the processing again later...
var saved = hudDisplayPage.ToArray();


This sort of system should make it relatively easy to take slices out of your data, and precache whichever ones are likely to be needed many times.
Also, take note of this handy tip (but ONLY for queries that end up being a performance hit)

var saved = hudDisplayPage.AsParallel().ToArray();


That line should essentially multithread your filtration process, so that all cores of your processor are on it.

The basic idea is this:

var enormousList = new List&lt;record&gt;();

//var enormousList = ... (over 5 million records)
var subList = enormousList.Where(onerecord =&gt; onerecord.clanName == ""RAGIN CAJUN"");

// At this point in the program, NO filtration has occurred just yet and little processing
// power has been used.

// This enumerates the list once for the ""ragin cajun"" filter, so this may take a while.
var sublistCount = subList.Count(); //take note that Count is a function here, not a property. 
var pageSize = 50;
var hudDisplayPage = enormousList.Take(pageSize).Select((record, idx) =&gt;
{
    return new HudPage(idx, record.clanName, record.playerName);
});
// for those who couldn't keep track; hudDisplayPage is now an IEnumerable (which you can use for-each on) containing
// 50 records of the list fitting the description. These are dynamic constructs; even now, hudDisplayPage hasn't
// yet been evaluated. If you want to cache one of these values so you're not doing the processing again later...
var saved = hudDisplayPage.ToArray();


This sort of system should make it relatively easy to take slices out of your data, and precache whichever ones are likely to be needed many times.
Also, take note of this handy tip (but ONLY for queries that end up being a performance hit)

var saved = hudDisplayPage.AsParallel().ToArray();


That line should essentially multithread your filtration process, so that all cores of your processor are on it.

I can't say I know enough about your problem to write out its solution in code; but it seems like your issue is mainly in figuring out the list processing, against a single list you don't want to modify or copy. Hope I haven't misunderstood your issue!

5395,5395,8570,Identify my Motobécane racing bike,"I bought a Motobécane last year (pics below), and now that the bottom bracket is broken, I really need to know the model of the bike, to help me change that piece.

It would also be helpful if someone could redirect me to the Motobécane catalogs of the years 82, 83, I can't find them, and I suspect my bike is from this period.

Technical specifications:


frame color: green and black (How customizable was that? I think they didn't sell the same colors each year)
frame: tubing inexternal 707, ""trainer"" (I don't find the appropriate info about it)
brakes: Weinmann
derailleur: Sachs - Huret. 12 gears
Wheel: Maillard
Bottom Crank: ?? width of the shell: 74mm. From this page http://sheldonbrown.com/vrbn-g-n.html, the old french ones have special dimensions. Also on Motobécane, they are swiss type (left-threaded). I don't know if this is a cotterless one, shimano octalink, or if I can put something more standard?


[EDIT: As suggested by @Blam, I took the bottom bracket out.
First mistake: shell width doesn't correspond to the red line on the pic, but less, so width should be 68mm, I'll double check on the bike.
The Brand is Stronglight, french brand, but the threading is the normal one (left-threaded on the right side, and right-threaded on the left side).
The axle is 120mm long, tapered square. Like this model: http://www.ebay.com/itm/VP-Components-Bottom-Bracket-120mm-Square-Taper-Unsealed-Bike-NEW-/311359596201?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&amp;hash=item487e7a66a9

But anyway, I'm still interested in knowing the model of this bike, and/or finding the Motobécane catalogues of years 1982-83]

Important Note: The rear wheel is not the original (was broken). I also changed the part of the crank where I put the feet when I bought it (maybe I shouldn't have...). 

Sorry if it looks quite dirty, I didn't have time to clean.

5112,5112,8131,How do you import members from another system to Wordpress and update passwords so they'll work?,"Our current system ( not using Wordpress ) has 1000s of users that we need to port over to Wordpress. The problem we're running into is that the passwords can't stay the same.

In our current system the passwords are saved with:

md5( md5( $password ) . USER_SALT ); // USER_SALT is a defined constant


Not the best obviously, but not the worst...

We need to make these password hashes that we currently have work in WP as well. Is there a way we can run all new passwords through this setup first and then through WPs own hashing?

I know you can hook into the functions like:

function my_hash_password($password){
    return md5( md5( $password ) . USER_SALT );
}
add_action('wp_hash_password', 'my_hash_password' );


For some reason that's not fully working either.

Surely somebody else has already gone through this before.

Thanks.

EDIT !!!!

So far there is some confusion. I am NOT asking no un-hash the hashed password that we have. What I am saying is that with our current system the passwords look like:

Password:  password
Hash function: md5( md5( $password ) . USER_SALT );
Output: d372f9c033e9c358b111ff265e080d3a


I want to 'maybe' be able to take the hash above and feed it to the native WP password hasher so that:

d372f9c033e9c358b111ff265e080d3a


becomes...

$P$BdrwxndTzgTVHUozGpQ9TEMYd6mpTw0


after it goes through their function.

Then when a user logs in we send their plain text password back through our function and then through WPs to get a match.

UPDATE !!!

So following the advice from rarst below I've done this:

function my_check_password($password, $hash, $user_id = '') {
    global $wp_hasher;
    if ( $hash == md5( md5( $password ) . USER_SALT ) ){
        if ( $user_id ) {
        $check = true;
        wp_set_password($password, $user_id);
        $hash = wp_hash_password($password);
      }
      return apply_filters( 'check_password', $check, $password, $hash, $user_id );
    }

    // If the hash is still md5...
    elseif ( strlen($hash) &lt;= 32 ) {
        $check = hash_equals( $hash, md5( $password ) );
        if ( $check &amp;&amp; $user_id ) {
            // Rehash using new hash.
            wp_set_password($password, $user_id);
            $hash = wp_hash_password($password);
        }
        return apply_filters( 'check_password', $check, $password, $hash, $user_id );
    }

    // If the stored hash is longer than an MD5, presume the
    // new style phpass portable hash.
    if ( empty($wp_hasher) ) {
        require_once( ABSPATH . WPINC . '/class-phpass.php');
        // By default, use the portable hash from phpass
        $wp_hasher = new PasswordHash(8, true);
    }

    $check = $wp_hasher-&gt;CheckPassword($password, $hash);

    /** This filter is documented in wp-includes/pluggable.php */
    return apply_filters( 'check_password', $check, $password, $hash, $user_id );
}

SystemRole is defined as:

402,402,627,"Buck converter with op-amp, inductor issues when load changes","I'm looking at the designs for a simple buck converter which has the P mosfet, inductor, capacitor and reverse based diode. Instead of PWM, I'm trying out to use an op-amp to switch the P mosfet but one thing that I notice is that if the load changes from low resistance to high resistance then the inductor spikes the voltage on the load to double what it is until it can re-stablise. (This is all in simulation)

Is this happening because I'm using the op-amp? How does using PWM affect the inductor in such a way that if the load would change from say 10 ohms to 100 ohms that the inductor won't spike the voltage? Perhaps PWM / fast switching keeps the inductor with such a low charge that when the load changes, the inductor doesn't have nearly enough voltage to do anything?

Cheers.
",2tails,https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/29571,"An OpAmp will not be able to directly control the state of a MOSFET.  The OpAmp will be too limited in output impedance, slew rate, and output voltage swing.  You are going to want a device that can switch quickly while driving the gate capacitance of a FET.  

There are different ways to control the on and off time of the FET.  PWM is the most used, but there is also constant on time and constant off time.  Constant on time and constant off time can be used in a hysteretic regulation approach, using a comparator to sense the output voltage relative to a reference.  Whatever control technique you try, you will need to bound the on or off time of the switch somehow to have any reasonable control of output voltage.

As to the overshoot you see when the load changes:  

Did you put resistance in series with the inductor and capacitor in the simulation?  Real parts have loss.  If you have no loss in the buck inductor and filter capacitor, filter Q will be very high.  High Q LC filters will ring to 2 times Vin on application of a step.

3383,3383,5393,Unity: Rolling a ball around a spherical planet with forces,"I'm trying to make a game in Unity where the player character is a ball (a sphere), and the game world is a planet (a very large sphere) that the ball can roll around on. The ball can be rolled in any direction, via the arrow keys. If the player holds the right arrow, the ball should roll smoothly to the right, all the way around the planet not leaving the ground, until it eventually reaches back to where it started. The camera follows the ball third person such that the ball always appears in the same position in the screen and the planet appears to be moving underneath it.

My question is, how can I use rigidbody.AddForce() to roll the ball in the way described above? What I think I need to do is to take the vector I get from taking the input values on the horizontal and vertical axes:

float moveX = Input.GetAxis (""Horizontal"");
float moveY = Input.GetAxis (""Vertical"");

Vector3 inputMovement = new Vector3 (moveX, 0.0f, moveY);


And rotate it somehow, so that I'm applying that vector as force to the ball but in the direction that's tangential to the point on the planet that the ball is currently on, and then apply it as force to the ball's rigidbody. So if you're looking at the planet head on, and the ball is at 3 o'clock, pressing the right arrow key should apply the force directly downwards.

Can anyone help me out here? I think it's probably really simple but I'm having trouble figuring it out exactly.

Guess what - the next box up uses for its bottom notes the same ones as the TOP notes of your known box. Thus you already know HALF of that one !!  So - in order to use all three boxes, you only need to replicate the pentatonic notes around frets 2/3  and frets 7/10.

",Patrick Oscity,https://english.stackexchange.com/users/12804,"I would like to expand upon their answers a bit.  Let's take the German word ""schadenfreude,"" which if you were to translate it into English would be ""pleasure derived from the misfortune of another.""  That would be about the shortest translation you could make for it, because English doesn't have a word specific to that definition.  Perhaps the shortest you could get without straying too far from the meaning would be ""sadistic pleasure,"" but that implies a degree of maliciousness to it and that the person getting the pleasure is causing the misfortune or pain.  

So, a translator translating from German to English has a choice to make when they come across the word: They can either translate the word as best they can or they can leave it as is. That's where the controversy arises.  If they translate the word then they usually will change the meaning of the text in some way, and if they leave it as is then they open the door to allow ""schadenfreude"" into the English lexicon (which is exactly what has happened with ""schadenfreude"").

294,294,473,Is there a way to limit the range of the range pattern in awk?,"I am trying to use the awk range pattern to find all SQL select statements in a group of files, inspired by this stackoverflow answer.

From the awk manual:


  The pattern1, pattern2 form of an expression is called a range pattern.  It matches all input records starting with a record that matches pattern1, and continuing until a record that matches  pattern2,  inclusive.


My initial attempt was 

awk '/select/,/from/' *


where * in this case just represents a large number of varied files.

This returned several false hits on HTML select tags, so I refined my command to

awk '/[^&lt;]select[^&gt;]/,/from/' *


which seems to have eliminated most of those hits.

However, I still get some false hits from occurrences of the word ""select"" in a comment, and those hits produce very many lines of noise each before they eventually hit a ""from"" or the end of the file.
What I would like is for the range pattern not to register a match if there are more than, say, 10 lines between the ""select"" and the ""from"".

My question is: Can I make the range pattern fail to match if the number of lines between the match of pattern1 and the match of pattern2 exceeds a given threshold, and if so, how?
",Anders Rabo Thorbeck,https://unix.stackexchange.com/users/112564,"Range patterns are useful but not flexible. Instead of using them, maintain the between-or-not state in a variable. The awk script /select/,/from/ is equivalent to

/select/ {printing = 1}

If you want to limit the range to a number of lines, maintain a counter of lines seen and accumulate the output until you've decided whether to display it.

/select/ {select_text = $0; select_line_count = 1;}
select_line_count {select_text = select_text ""\n"" $0}
/from/ {if (select_line_count &lt;= 10) {print select_text; print}

1005,1005,1584,Measuring Resistance of a Wire With an ADC,"I'm trying to design a circuit which can measure small resistances down to 0.1 Ohm and a max. of 10 Ohms. I won't be measuring actual resistors but rather large coil of wires, upto 500 m (as you can imagine, these wires are quite thick).

Here's the circuit I came up with:


The circuit works by maintaining a constant current through the device under test, R2. With a current of 100 mA, R2 would develop a voltage between 10 mV to 50 mV.

I think in an ideal world this would work but in practice I may have a hard time measuring 0.1 Ohms with this - mainly due to the ADC. Let's assume the ADC is 10-bit with VREF of 5V. This translates to 5mV per step. If R2 = 0.1 and Iout = 100 mA, then the voltage present at the ADC would be 50 mV - but I'm not sure how buried under noise this would be.

My question is, should I increase the gain to, say, 50. If the gain is 50, then the voltage present at the ADC would be 500 mV - but the max. measurable resistance would be 1 Ohms. To measure 10 Ohms, I would need to lower the current to 10 mA instead of 100 mA. A way to do that would be use an FET to switch out R1 and connect a 20 Ohm resistor at Iout.

I don't need the circuit to measure the resistance precisely - a tolerance of +/- 10% is fine.

This uses an opamp+BJT current source with a three-decade range.  The range of the current source is selected by grounding one of three resistors.  You can probably achieve your accuracy goals by using AVR outputs to switch the three resistors.  Switch between output low (for enable) or input (for disable).  Analog input is better, but the voltage will be an unambigious high, so digital input is OK.  For better accuracy, connect the 4K to resistor to two pins.  The output resistance of an AVR digital out is about 25 ohms: 

.
The +5V line is used for the reference of both the current source and ADC.  Variations in supply voltage will cancel.  The alternative would be to have a reference in the current source and a reference in the ADC... not necessary here.  Microcontroller ADCs are generally happy to use the supply rails as reference.
You must make four connections to the device under test.  Two of the connections deliver the current, and two of the connections present the voltage across the device under test to the measurement circuit.  Four-wire connection is necessary to measure low resistances ( &lt; 1 ohm )!  Otherwise you are measuring your probe resistance by accident.
The opamp's offset voltage is the most important parameter.  Use a chopper amp and don't worry about it.  I've spec'd OPA2333, which is a nice slow amplifier that's always worked well for me.
If your probe resistance is higher than about an ohm, you should go for the full instrumentation amplifier.  But with reasonable probes this should meet spec as-is.

One advantage of Twilight is of course enabling High/Dark Templars. So ... how (and when) do you decide which of them to get first?
",ripper234,https://gaming.stackexchange.com/users/1161,"I'll try to cover as much as I can in this answer.

As I stated in my comment it depends on what race you are playing against, what you scout, and when you are trying to get both these buildings. Map size also factors into your decision as well.

Since you are referring as to having to make a choice, I'm going to assume that you are trying to do this off one base on a relatively smaller map so all answers below will be tailored around that assumption. If it's a big map (like Tal'darim Alter) you can quickly get a second base and do something like a +1/+1 + charge or blink attack.

So what race are you playing against.

Terran
If you are playing terran that is going a heavy bio start, a forge is a good choice with a small zealot, sentry, and stalker army. Getting a quick +1 armour will reduce marine damage to zealots to 1 with a guardian shield up (Guardian shield reduces damage by 2, zealots start with 1 armour, marines attack for 5) making them that much stronger against against a bio army. 

If you scout them and they're going a tech route then it will boil down to what you plan on doing with your army and what path you will be choosing. Archons and storms do significant damage to a terran army late game. The same can be said if you go with colossi and upgrades if they don't have vikings either.

Zerg
This is a tough one to make a choice because zerg can swap so quickly with their army composition. The safer choice between the two is to go forge first with a +1 attack upgrade. The +1 attack allows for zealots to 2 shot zerglings instead of 3. This increases the effectiveness of zealots versus zerglings by 33%. 

That said, if they go roaches and you're heavy zealot, they can be kited forever on and off creep so you need to make sure you are fighting on your terms. A few sentries thrown in will stop them from running away so you can deal your damage. It does also mean that blink stalkers will have a significant advantage over roaches as well. Even charge would work too. But it depends on what their army composition is so you sort of need the most well rounded army possible. 

Keep in mind, late game, storms are very helpful versus the swarm.

Protoss
Again this comes down to army composition. If it's a stalker vs stalker fight, the player with blink will win (assuming properly blink micro).

If one of the players goes the colossi route later on, the one with the forge early with early attack upgrades will destroy the army of the guy that doesn't have the upgrades. 

This mirror match-up is difficult to theorize without scouting information. If you see a forge upgrading you need to get one in response, if you fall behind you will lose. It really depends on what you plan on going for a build. 

Generally speaking though forge is the safer bet. You can get quicker upgrades, and if you scout a Twilight council and dark shrine you have access to dropping a cannon to save you from Dark Templars as well without having to spend the money on a Robotics Bay and get an observer.

As you can see, the bottom-right point of the diamond is perfectly on the path, but the top-left point is clearly above the path.  It appears that the diamond lies on the tangent line of the path at the bottom-right point of the diamond.

Question:

How can I place this open diamond arrow tip so that both points of the diamond are on the path?

Bonus Question:

What is the best solution to make the area inside the diamond completely white? I don't want to see the path in the inside of the diamond.  I currently have a solution that I feel is a hack, which is to place a white (closed) diamond arrow tip in the same spot first:

1463,1463,2304,Why does playing the piano give me a pain in the neck?,"I have a keyboard set up with a proper stool so my arms are held straight out, with music at eye level - almost identical to how I set up my PC for good posture.

But while I can use the PC all day with no issues, within 5 minutes of playing the keyboard - I'm just starting - I get stiffness pain at the bottom of my neck, probably one vertebra above the shoulders.

Can anyone advise what is causing this and how to adjust? I think my main posture can't be too bad - I'm not hunching or craning my neck - but wondered if perhaps I am 'clenching' somehow?
",Mr. Boy,https://music.stackexchange.com/users/15313,"I'm a violinist, not a pianist, but it's very common for beginning violin players to have severe pain because they are too tense, especially when they are self taught.  I'm going to suggest a few generic techniques to start minimizing tension.


When you sit down at the piano, think about how you are sitting.
Look for any tension, especially in your neck and shoulders. Close
your eyes, and take a few deep, slow breaths to help you relax.
Play a note. Not a piece, or even a scale, just a single note.
Think about how relaxed you feel playing that note. Think about
tension in your back and shoulders. If you find any, slow down again
and relax. Now try two notes, or maybe even three or four. But still
think about relaxing, not about music. This is what your body should
feel like all the time when you play.
Now you've got a baseline for how you should feel while playing.
So play something simple. Either a short tune you know well, or a
scale, or whatever you find easy. Halfway through, stop and think
about tension. Did you tense up again? If you did, sit back, relax,
and start over, slower. Slowing down makes it easier to play, and
easier to think about not getting tense.
Another exercise is to practice breathing while playing. A lot of
beginners tend to hold their breathe, which just adds stress and
tension. So play a scale. Depending on your speed, you may want to
breathe in going up, and out going down, or breathe in for 4 notes,
out for 4 notes. Just practice breathing in rhythm, and being aware
of your breathe. When you are playing music, start thinking about
when you breathe in general. Breathing exercises aren't just for
singers.


In summary: Consciously relax before playing, and check for tension as you play. If you get tense, back off, relax, and slow down. Make sure you breathe.

If the tension is caused more by your posture, you may need to find a teacher to help you out, since we can't see how you hold yourself over the net. A teacher could also help with the sort of tension issues I'm talking about here, so if lessons are an option, it would probably be worthwhile, even if only for a short time.

535,535,840,Equivalent Key Signatures,"I've noticed that a variety of pieces in the classical repetoire (certainly at least the piano repetoire), label what seems to be effectively the same key signature differently. That is, I am not aware of any differences in terms of key between a piece in ""G Sharp major"" and ""A flat major"" (or their equivalent minors). Is there any reason that sometimes a sharped key signature is used while at other times the equivalent flatted key signature is used?

As a related point, I have undoubtedly noticed the preference of certain ""equivalent"" key signatures over others. For example, one encounters ""E flat"" significantly more than ""D sharp"" and likewise ""C sharp"" significantly more than ""D flat"". Is there any particular reason for this, or is it simply a convention that has been handed down to use through musical history?

2208,2208,3516,Two different analytic curves cannot intersect in infinitely many points,"A curve in Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^n$, $n \geq 2$ is $analytic$ if the coordinates of its points $x= x_{1},...,x_{n}$ can be expressed as analytic functions of a real parameter $x_{i}=x_{i}(t)$, $i=1,...,n$ and $\alpha \leq t \leq \beta$ and the derivatives $x'(t_{0})$ do not simultaneously vanish for any $t_{0} \in [\alpha, \beta]$.
I search for a proof of the following fact:

If the set of intersection points of two analytic curves is infinite, then these curves coincide.

Can we prove the same as above if we relax the condition that the coordinates are analytic to the condition that the coordinates belong to the class $C^{\infty}$?

Edit: Thanks to below remark by Ramiro, to obtain the above implication, we have to assume that any two curves $K_{1}, K_{2}$ as in the question are such that $K_{1} \cap K_{2}$ is not another analytic curve.

2nd edit: As suggested Peter, we can reformulate our question as follows:
   Consider two immersed curves which are parameterized real analytically on compact intervals. If they have an infinite number of different intersection points, then their union is again a real analytic immersed curve.

4571,4571,7242,"What is the Goal of ""Hot Network Questions""?","There has been a tug-of-war in the hot-questions list.

Community members like JonW seem to be unhappy with the traffic that it brings to their site:


  'But we want to encourage people to post, that's the whole point of the HQ list!' I hear you cry. I disagree. We want to encourage people to the site not just to that question.


The SE Community Team seems to have a different opinion as Shog9 points out (emphasis mine):


  the results have been... Not great so far: a significantly smaller number of people are clicking through to randomly-selected questions than to the top questions, which hints that the algorithm may've been doing a better job of identifying general-interest questions across topics than some expected.


Disclaimer: This should not be taken as a slight of the community team whatsoever, nor do I think this is some cause for revolt or a boxing match as the below prose may indicate. These are just poorly applied literary tools to emphasize the drastically different approaches to the same list between two groups.

In the Red Corner, the Community Members

The goal of the hot questions should be to drive up interest in the site. The hot questions should be a lure to encourage SE network users to contribute to other content, not just do a drive-by on the hot question.

In the Blue Corner, the Community Team

The goal of the hot questions should be to drive traffic to general-interest questions. After all, the Hot Network Questions used to be more accurately named as ""Popular Questions"".

What is the Goal of Advertising Network Questions?

Before discussing how to calculate hotness, or how the list should be ordered, we need to come to an agreement on what the heck we are actually trying to achieve. Once we know what we are looking to accomplish, we can find the best way to do that.

The list of questions from a variety of sites is in a great location screen-wise, it is readily accessible and does get a lot of eyes on it. But as with any marketing, the goal isn't just to grab eyes, it's to grab the right eyes.*

* I have nothing against left eyes. Most of my friends have left eyes too. And they are awesome. But in the context right eyes are not a geospatial thing, but rather in the 'correct' sense.

So what are the right eyes? What type of people do we want to attract to our site? What would we determine as 'success'? How can we measure that success?

Please do not limit yourself to the very narrowly scoped topic above. Think outside the box if you'd like. On every page across the network we have a nice piece of real estate for showing off the rest of the network. How can that space best be used if not on a list of questions picked by an arbitrary algorithm?
",jmac,https://meta.stackexchange.com/users/209637,"Well, I can tell you what I hoped for when I was a regular user on a tiny site: network-wide exposure. When Biblical Hermeneutics showed up in the hot question list, I vividly recall day-dreaming that everyone who had an interest in the Bible on the network would see our little site and have a burning desire to ask and answer hermeneutics questions.  It was a good feeling to know that Jack's question and the answers it had already accumulated would get some exposure. It felt like our little community had earned a collective gold star.

Now I'll admit it was a bigger deal in my mind than it was in reality.  As of this writing, the question has fewer than 600 views. It's not anywhere to be found on the first page of BH's Greatest Hits. Likely we didn't get even one new user out of the deal. And we certainly didn't have any crowd control problems. But you know what? I'm still proud of our little community and that question. There aren't a lot of achievements a site can earn from the time pro tem moderators are appointed until graduation, but having a ""hot question"" is one of them.

Back then, it wasn't as easy to find network-wide hot questions. Now that they are listed in the sidebar, it's not uncommon for me to wander over to a site I'd forgotten even existed.  (Hello, Code Golf!) Ideally, I will find a question that isn't just entertaining to read, but also sparks my interest in writing something. There are some brilliant, eloquent, and thoughtful people on our sites, so I think some cross-pollination can strengthen the whole network.

The other day, I was looking into the RPG site and trying to figure out how it got a healthy bump in visitors since the beginning of the year. As I dug, it became clear that one factor has been direct traffic from other sites on the network. Digging a bit more, I turned up a series of ""hot questions"" such as Is 3d6 the same as 1d18? Since you don't have to be an expert in a particular RPG system to read, appreciate, or even answer this question, it attracted considerable attention (11,377 views so far). Site traffic also spiked noticeably the week the question was asked.

It was not without pain: two answers were deleted and the voting seems disproportionate. Arguably the question is not even on topic, yet it's tied for 26th on the all-time best questions list. While the answers tend to be good, none of them demonstrate any particular RPG expertise. But the question also got two solid first answers (one from Eric Lippert and the other from someone who has provided an equally upvoted answer). All-in-all, the HQ list looks like a net positive on that site. 

Speaking of rolling the dice, hot questions are a sort of gamble. They take advantage of the blockbuster business model. Every day there are dozens of new hot questions. Some of them blow up and others fizzle. Most sites consider it a great success to convert just one reader in a hundred (or even a thousand) into an occasional contributor. The hot question formula improves the odds by taking into account indicators of interest and quality signalled by regular users of the site. In other words, if lots of people on a site read, answer, and vote on posts, we can feel pretty confident that showing the question around will attract similar people.

1437,1437,2262,DataTreeListView shows no results,"'m using a custom control from the ObjectListView package. It's widely used by stackoveflow members so that's why i post it here.

But i find it very hard to show data results in the DataTreeListView control. 
This is my code:

         DataSet ds = LoadDatasetFromXml(""FamilyTree.xml"");

         if (ds.Tables.Count &gt; 0)
         {
             this.dataGridView1.DataSource = ds;
             this.dataGridView1.DataMember = ""Person"";

             this.dataTreeListView1.DataMember = ""Person"";
             this.dataTreeListView1.DataSource = new DataViewManager(ds);
         }


And this is the result:


I use the xml that's provided with the package, so that won't be the problem. I changed all the dataTreeListView propertys so they are just the same as the demo project.

I also tried it using Linq with an selfmade table but with the same results. The datagridview on the other hand works like a charm...

Does anyone have an idea?

It seems to me that science and copyright are not compatible. 

Let's say I wrote a very important paper in, say, cell biology.
Suppose I have the copyright for the paper(I think so under the copyright law of the US).
Then I also have the derivative-work copyright.
Can I exercise the right?
For example, can I refuse other people to use the original idea of my paper?
Or can I forbid them using an original technical procedure described in my paper? Or what about copying graphs or figures?
",Makoto Kato,https://academia.stackexchange.com/users/28722,"I really do not understand this purpose of your question. Do you want to copy verbatim from someone else? Do you want to forbid other from expanding your work presented in one of your papers? Both these have easy answers. In case 1, do not do it. In case 2, do not publish a paper. Then your idea will be all yours for ever (unless someone else publishes the same idea before you and then you lose). Publishing papers is about sharing results and ideas. Everyone can then expand those ideas as they wish. For protecting novel ideas there are patents and publishing scientific papers is not the way to do it.

You also forget what citation is all about. I can say in my paper a short summary (in my own words) of what you first told in your paper in my related work section if I cite you. I can refer to your results if I cite you. I can compare my results against yours (including those presented in your figures), if I cite you. I can expand your results if I implement your method and improve it significantly, if I cite you. All these are fair uses of your scientific work. If you do not want any of these, do not publish a scientific paper.

UPDATE: The tone of my answer is a bit hostile but two questions on the same day, one basically defending H. Obokata and the other one basically suggesting copyrighting ideas on scientific papers (most probably for profit or fame) shows a complete misunderstanding on how science and scientific publications are supposed to work.

3029,3029,4828,What is the probability that Brian makes money on his first roll,"
  Brian plays a game in which two fair, six-sided dice are rolled
  simultaneously. For each die, an even number means that he wins that
  amount of money and an odd number means that he loses that amount of
  money. What is the probability that Brian makes money on his first
  roll?


To find the probability, do we need to find the even numbers only. There are 36 outcomes from the two dies. So is there an easy  way to get the arrangements? 
",Complex Guy,https://math.stackexchange.com/users/52950,"Let the values of the dice in a roll be $a$ and $b$. You win money if ($1$) $a$ and $b$ are both even, ($2$) $a$ is even and $b$ is odd with $a&gt;b$, or ($3$) $a$ is odd and $b$ is even with $a&lt;b$.
For ($1$) there are $3$ even numbers in $1,2,\dots,6$, so there are $3^2=9$ ways for $a$ and $b$ to both be positive.
For ($2$) consider the three cases cases: $a=2 \implies b=1$; $a=4\implies b=1,3$; and $a=6\implies b=1,3,5$. Therefore, there are $6$ ways to get condition ($2$).
Condition ($3$) is the same as ($2$) by symmetry, so the probability to win money is
$$
\frac{3^2 + (2)(6)}{6^2} = \frac{21}{36} = \frac{7}{12}.
$$
We can easily generalize this to any $n$-faced pair of dice when $n$ is even. Notice that the triangular numbers appear when counting conditions ($2$) and ($3$). Therefore, the general probability is
$$
\frac{(n/2)^2 + 2T_{n/2}}{n^2} = \frac{n + 1}{2n}.

For ($1$) there are $3$ even numbers in $1,2,\dots,6$, so there are $3^2=9$ ways for $a$ and $b$ to both be positive.
For ($2$) consider the three cases cases: $a=2 \implies b=1$; $a=4\implies b=1,3$; and $a=6\implies b=1,3,5$. Therefore, there are $6$ ways to get condition ($2$).
Condition ($3$) is the same as ($2$) by symmetry, so the probability to win money is
$$
\frac{3^2 + (2)(6)}{6^2} = \frac{21}{36} = \frac{7}{12}.
$$
We can easily generalize this to any $n$-faced pair of dice when $n$ is even. Notice that the triangular numbers appear when counting conditions ($2$) and ($3$). Therefore, the general probability is
$$
\frac{(n/2)^2 + 2T_{n/2}}{n^2} = \frac{n + 1}{2n}.

6039,6039,9584,Using a time to set XY chart axis scaling as in Excel 2003,"In Excel 2003, when you created a XY chart using time as an axis, you could set the scaling of the axis by typing in the date. In Excel 2007, you have to use the decimal version of the time (eg. How many days since some arbitrary earlier date).

A developer posted on a blog that this issue would be fixed in a future release, but all versions of Excel 2007 I have tried have not resolved this issue. The relevant quote:


  Those of you familiar with this technique of converting time to a decimal may recall that Excel 2003 allowed you to enter a date and time like “1/1/07 11:00 AM” directly in the  axis option min/max fields and Excel would calculate the appropriate decimal representation.  This currently does not work in Excel 2007 but will be fixed in a subsequent release. 


I was wondering if there was a way to avoid having to make such a calculation?

4811,4811,7643,How do I find a vacuum leak? I'd highly prefer not to use a carb cleaner spray,"The car is a 1998 Oldsmobile Intrigue with 3.8L V6 engine (3800 Series).  I've been doing my research and due diligence, but please understand I'm very inexperienced with automobiles.

I went to Autozone and the reading I got from the OBD II tool was a P0171 error code.  A lean or rich condition on Bank 1.  First, I don't know where Bank 1 is.  I have a feeling it's a cracked intake-manifold, an intake-manifold gasket leak, or both.  But let's assume I have no clue where the vacuum leak is coming from.  And I don't want to use a carb cleaner -- I read that I could cause a fire and I don't think I'm experienced enough to use something like that.   I'd prefer to err on the side of caution.

I've seen on youtube a long-time mechanic who uses a cigar as a cheap alternative to a smoke test machine.  But I'm not sure if something like that could be used if you have no idea where the leak is coming from.

So I ask those who are far, far more experienced than me.  What ares some methods I can use if I have a vacuum leak, but I literally don't have a clue where it could be?

Thank you.

I'm sure that most mechanics would have to agree with me that in order to properlly diagnose an issue like this it must be done correctly and without any short cuts.

I've always attacked issues like these with a smoke tester. I have 3 of them personally. Even if the leak is obvious I will still smoke the vacuum system before and after the repair to ensure that there are no other obvious leaks. This will ensure that the vehicles doesn't come back with the same issue &amp; the same cause. If the vehicle was to return without any leaks then it's time to look at one way check valves and switch-over valves that would cause internal leaks in the system. But, that's a whole other story.

999,999,1577,Identify my Motobécane racing bike,"I bought a Motobécane last year (pics below), and now that the bottom bracket is broken, I really need to know the model of the bike, to help me change that piece.

It would also be helpful if someone could redirect me to the Motobécane catalogs of the years 82, 83, I can't find them, and I suspect my bike is from this period.

Technical specifications:


frame color: green and black (How customizable was that? I think they didn't sell the same colors each year)
frame: tubing inexternal 707, ""trainer"" (I don't find the appropriate info about it)
brakes: Weinmann
derailleur: Sachs - Huret. 12 gears
Wheel: Maillard
Bottom Crank: ?? width of the shell: 74mm. From this page http://sheldonbrown.com/vrbn-g-n.html, the old french ones have special dimensions. Also on Motobécane, they are swiss type (left-threaded). I don't know if this is a cotterless one, shimano octalink, or if I can put something more standard?


[EDIT: As suggested by @Blam, I took the bottom bracket out.
First mistake: shell width doesn't correspond to the red line on the pic, but less, so width should be 68mm, I'll double check on the bike.
The Brand is Stronglight, french brand, but the threading is the normal one (left-threaded on the right side, and right-threaded on the left side).
The axle is 120mm long, tapered square. Like this model: http://www.ebay.com/itm/VP-Components-Bottom-Bracket-120mm-Square-Taper-Unsealed-Bike-NEW-/311359596201?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&amp;hash=item487e7a66a9

But anyway, I'm still interested in knowing the model of this bike, and/or finding the Motobécane catalogues of years 1982-83]

Important Note: The rear wheel is not the original (was broken). I also changed the part of the crank where I put the feet when I bought it (maybe I shouldn't have...). 

Sorry if it looks quite dirty, I didn't have time to clean.

",PlasmaBinturong,https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/users/19414,"Here's a partial answer (how to deal with the bottom bracket, not what bike it is):

The easiest solution (and likely best) is to buy the universal bottom bracket from Velo Orange (or similar).

There is some more information at this link. 

I wouldn't bother trying non-square taper -- you're likely not to find a way to fit anything else in. If you want to match the original threading, you'll likely have to buy from Phil Wood or Velo Orange and end up with a square taper anyway. Phil Wood will cost a lot of money, but Velo Orange will be around 40-50 bucks for the right threading (and around 70 for the universal). 

Then, just buy your favorite square taper crankset (there are still a lot of good ones on the market) and go to town.

5467,5467,8682,What's a common mechanism for emailing in the background?,"When users sign up to my site, the connection from my server to our 3rd-party SMTP provider is very bad and the app takes from a few seconds to a few minutes to connect. While it is trying to connect and send, users are forced to wait there and sometimes they would just give up and leave the site.

This is horrible user experience. What is a good way to make this seem instantaneous (having to host our own mailserver is not an option at this point)? Some way to execute this in the background? Maybe using some type of queuing mechanism?

I'm using the LNAMP stack on a CentOS 5 x64 machine. App is using CodeIgniter.

EDIT:

It seems using a local mailserver to use as a relay is a common solution. But how does one log or track whether or not email was delivered correctly by using this method? 

Sidenote: Some ESPs provide a REST API for email delivery (ours do too). We currently use SMTP and not their REST API.

4364,4364,6940,What is the best way to show the user large amounts of data?,"I am working on an application with a team that has roughly 2 years of data. This data is shown through multiple visualization methods. Part of the application is a settings panel, which lets the user control various things about the application (How much data they see, color schemes, etc.)

In the settings panel, one of the options allows the user to view their data in table format (report style). Because there is about two years worth of data, it's been broken up in to Month and Year increments. If the user wants to export a particular month, they can export that data to a .csv which can then be opened in a third party program like Excel or Calc. This is what it currently looks like with the entire visualization screen:



Close up view:



Even with the data broken up, there is still a substantial amount in each table (probably about 150 rows). This means the user still has to scroll to view the data. My co-workers think this is the best option, however I want to take a different approach.

I personally think that everything in the settings should be something to change the way the data looks or to get some of the data to take somewhere else.

My solution would be to show the user some sample data (maybe 3-4 rows), then give them the option to export as the main function (as opposed to reading it in browser). I think this makes more sense since the user won't have the ability to sort, select, change, etc. like they would in Excel. Mine would look something like this:



It's not perfect, but it should give you a general idea of the look I'm going for. So down to the actual question...

Question

Which scenario makes more sense?


Display this much data to the user in browser (in a settings panel)
Give the user sample data and let them export it and do what they please with it

They are attacking the village because they are evil, they are stealing the princess because they are evil, etc.

Over time, my group needs have grown to need more complicated and detailed villains. It is important to consider motives.  What is it that defines them as 'evil' to the party?  In terms of a fantasy setting, what would you consider to be an interesting villain?

What qualities make a villain that inspires your party to rally against him?  What kind of villains have worked for your games in the past?

Example:


  A member of nobility is using trade connections to move valuable pieces of art into another country that is secretly paying him quite well and is framing a member of the party to take the fall.  In addition, someone important to the party member has been taken hostage with a promise of release once they party member takes the blame for the crime.

  Disclaimer: I don't know much about DAO. I typically use ADODB.


The expensive part of this code is opening and closing the recordset repeatedly. So, instead of opening and closing it every time this is triggered, open it once when the form is first loaded.

Of course, now you don't have the specific record you're looking for when the event fires. You can use the Find and FindNext methods to filter the entire recordset down to what you need in the event procedure.

Of course, this is if I can't talk you into switching to ADODB for your purposes here. It supports parameterized queries, which (in theory) should execute a bit faster. This is because, to the best of my knowledge, DAO requests all of the data and then filters it down in memory on the local machine. An ADODB parameterized query allows for the plan to be cached and only returns the results of the statement.

Dim rst As ADODB.Recordset
Dim cmd as ADODB.Command

Const sql as String = _

     Set rst = .Execute
End With

' some code to set january's value

cmd.Parameters(1).Value = feburaryDate

Set rst = cmd.Execute

' some code to set february's value


Note how we simply pass the query a new value, instead of duplicating all of the query text? This is just one of ADODB's benefits.



One other, rather minor note.

I am working with hydroacoustic data for mapping and interpreting the seafloor.

I am not really good in GIS but I need to use it for some reasons. I seem to be unable to plot these data in GIS.

NB: When using /dev/random you may have to wiggle your mouse or press keys (e.g. ctrl, shift, etc.) to generate entropy.

936,936,1486,How to show $a$ is an element of every maximal ideal of ring $R$ iff $1-ab$ is a unit for all $b \in R$?,"Let $R$ be a commutative unitary ring. The task is to prove the statement which says that for an element $a\in R$ stands: $a$ is an element of every maximal ideal of $R$ iff $1-ab$ is a unit for all $b \in R$.

My effort

Further I suppose ring is non-trivial, otherwise situation is clear.

For an arbitrary $b \in R$ we consider principal ideal $(b)$ and find a maximal ideal $\mathfrak{m}_b\supset (b)$ (according to Zorn's Lemma), so we have $a\in \mathfrak{m}_b, b \in \mathfrak{m}_b\Rightarrow ab \in \mathfrak{m}_b$. $\mathfrak{m}_b$ is maximal, hence particularly prime, so $1\notin \mathfrak{m}_b$ and $(1-ab)+\mathfrak{m}_b\neq0+\mathfrak{m}_b\in R/\mathfrak{m}_b$. $R/\mathfrak{m}_b$ is a field, so we find $p \in R : p(1-ab)+\mathfrak{m}_b=1+\mathfrak{m}_b$. But seemingly this is not enough to find inverse of $1-ab$ in $R$.

In other direction I can only show that: $1-ab$  is invertible $\Rightarrow ab\neq1\Rightarrow a$ is not a unit and hence is an element of a maximal ideal. But I can't figure out how to show that $a$ is in every maximal ideal.

I give up because I tried to solve this too long, the statement seems pretty natural for me, but I don't see something obvious so I would love it if someone gives me an advice.

2850,2850,4535,"Does the Canon *.CR2/CRW format contain ""truly RAW"" data?","In my work I am dealing with *.CR2 raw images taken by a Canon DSLR in raw mode.
When I read about the format here, I was surprised to find that it has 4 TIFF IFDs which contain a) Original Size JPEG Image b) Thumbnail JPEG image c) Uncompressed RGB data d) Lossless JPEG image.

My impression until now was any camera captured RAW image file would have Raw Bayer Data i.e. R,Gr,B,Gb kind of bayer data, and some EXIF data about camera capture settings etc.

But after reading this CR2 specification I am slightly confused as to how can it have a RGB data or even surprisingly JPEG data. This seems to be the data after demosaicing(obtaining the missing R/G/B pixel data for the original sensor Bayer pattern). If thats the case I would not consider *.CR2 as ""truly raw"" data. It has done demosaicing before dumping the socalled raw file.

Am I missing something?

Does any other Camera Raw formats(e.g. Nikon - *.NEF, Kodac - *.kdc, Pentax - *.ptx/pef,...) have real raw bayer data without any processing done?
",goldenmean,https://photo.stackexchange.com/users/2438,"I think you are most definitely missing something. Consider: JPG is used to store (and usually compress, lossy) images. Any image. What is an image? It is a great big bundle of pixels, when all is said and done.

The output from the camera sensor is a great big bundle of pixels, too. They just happen not to be full-colour RGB pixels, they are monochrome pixels - whether any individual pixel represents R G or B depends on its location on the image sensor, which is known. But their monochrome, colour-given-by-position nature does not mean that they cannot be usefully stored in the JPG way. A bundle of pixels is a bundle of pixels, and why reinvent the wheel?

Look more closely at the document. ""So with a BAYER grid of RG/GB, the even rows has interleaved HuffCode/Diff data for ...RGRGRG..., while the odd rows it is ...GBGBGB..."". So, the raw Bayer output is stored in a JPG format. Lossless, it is stated (otherwise we'd have a problem!) and presumably in more than 8 bits' depth. You have too cook this quite a lot to get a useful photo from it. 

The other JPG images are used for in-camera preview, histogram and such. It makes good sense to cook these once and for all as the image is taken, rather than having to do it on the fly each and every time you want to look at them. This also means that the computer can fish these out for thumbnail purposes once you unload the camera into the PC.

* I can't add a comment for some reason, so this goes here:
Goldenmean, what makes you think that there is a problem that you don't have full RGB info for each pixel? Assuming that you are creating a RAW format and have a measurement of 128 from a ""red"" sensor cell; you can either choose to store this as 128,0,0 or 128,128,128 or, of you are feeling clever, 128,""data from next cell"", ""data from the cell after that"" to save some space. Doesn't matter really. It's the RAW converter's job to keep track of this (though I'm sure the programmers would appreciate it if you documented how you chose to store your sensor data) and make an actual picture from it.

742,742,1177,How can I speed up the rate at which putty dries?,"We're (slowly) renovating the sash windows in our house and the current window is causing problems. What should have been a quick job (especially at this time of year!) has turned into a marathon because the putty won't dry.

We had to replace a couple of panes of glass (one was cracked and we broke another when using a heat gun to remove the paint) so we knew it would take a little while. On a previous window the putty took over three weeks to dry enough to paint partly because (as we thought) there was too much oil. So this time we rolled the putty on newspaper first to try to remove the excess oil. It seemed to work, but after two weeks the putty is still soft to the touch.

We've tried standing the windows next to a radiator but all that seemed to do was make it softer (which was obviously going to happen in hindsight).

So given that we don't want to reputty the windows what can we do to speed up the drying process.

We've had to seal off the room and cover the window as best we can in the meantime.

I've found this advice on DoItYourself.com which doesn't really help as it says use other materials!

The answers to this post on DIY-Forums are confusing at best and possibly contradictory as one recommends exposing the putty to moisture(!) to speed the drying process.
",ChrisF,https://diy.stackexchange.com/users/194,"Heat will make the putty softer, which is why you can heat it up to remove it.  Putty pretty much stays soft for years.  Initially, it doesn't really dry out so much as oxidize which forms a skin on it.

If you want to use a traditional one, paint it as soon as it forms enough of a skin that the paint will stick to it.

2158,2158,3441,How to export a single huge table from SQL Server?,"I'm given the task to export the content of a huge table from a production database and to import the data into a database at a remote location.

The Table has about 45,000,000 rows. using about 4 GB space in the database.

Its 10 Columns are of type int, datetime and varchar(n) &lt;= 255, but some of the varchar fields contain newlines and the usual field separators used by bulkcopy.

I guess export to Excel is no option due to the number of rows.
Export with SSIS to Flatfile is possible (took about 30 minutes), but reimport is not automatic, since some fields where spitted.

My current idea is


create a new database on the production server (using same
collations as the production database)
Set its recovery mode to simple
copy the data with
Select * into copy_of_table from prod_db..big_table
Detach mdf file from this new database and ship it to the other
location
Drop adhoc database


I assume that inserting into a database with simple recovery model generates only minimal logging on the new database and this way is one of the fastest possible to export the data and the impact to the production database is the least possible.

30,30,47,How do different tissue culture matrices affect background in fluorescent microscopy?,"In response to my previous question, I've been reading up a little bit on poly-D-lysine, Collagen I, Collagen IV, laminin, and other tissue culture coatings that promote cell adhesion. I've always assumed that anything other than standard TC-treated plastic or glass would significantly increase background, but perhaps my views on background fluorescence are a little outdated. Does anybody have experience with these in a fluorescent microscopy/high-throughput screening environment?

Specifically in my case, I'm looking at endocytosis and trafficking of a labeled protein into the lysosome. I'm labeling the protein with the pH-dependent dye pHrodoTM from Molecular Probes, which supposedly has very little fluorescence at neutral pH, but becomes very bright as the pH drops when endocytic vesicles become lysosomes. This theoretically means that a final wash step is not needed, but with a matrix coating on the plates I'm worried about background.

So, what is the current thinking as far as background fluorescence of the various TC matrices is concerned? Does the background come from the matrix itself, or by the fluorescent dye becoming adsorbed to it? Is it wavelength-dependent? Fortunately I may not be stuck with my poorly-adhering cells, and I may not need supplemental matrix at all in the end, but I still want a better understanding of how it works.

4131,4131,6595,Is lots of red juice normal when making sous-vide steak?,"So I made a 1lb hanger steak via sous-vide the other day and cooked it for 45 minutes at 130F.

After I seared in a cast iron pan, I took the meat off of the pan and let it sit for a few minutes and then sliced it up(against the grain) into smaller portions.

I noticed a lot of red juice in the plate as I was slicing it up but after I put it on a plate and it was sitting at the table, the meat almost ended up swimming in red juice.

When I order medium rare steak at a restaurant and it comes out pre-sliced, I don't usually notice this much red juice.

Is this normal?

UPDATE:

Found this great article explaining what was going on:
http://www.seriouseats.com/2009/12/how-to-have-juicy-meats-steaks-the-food-lab-the-importance-of-resting-grilling.html#continued

He has another article about sous vide ( http://www.seriouseats.com/2010/03/how-to-sous-vide-steak.html ) where he claims that you don't need to let the meat rest after searing. This is the one that originally led me to not need to rest the steak.

Looks like there is some resting that is required. Will post up with results next time I make some steak.

1440,1440,2268,Equivalent Key Signatures,"I've noticed that a variety of pieces in the classical repetoire (certainly at least the piano repetoire), label what seems to be effectively the same key signature differently. That is, I am not aware of any differences in terms of key between a piece in ""G Sharp major"" and ""A flat major"" (or their equivalent minors). Is there any reason that sometimes a sharped key signature is used while at other times the equivalent flatted key signature is used?

As a related point, I have undoubtedly noticed the preference of certain ""equivalent"" key signatures over others. For example, one encounters ""E flat"" significantly more than ""D sharp"" and likewise ""C sharp"" significantly more than ""D flat"". Is there any particular reason for this, or is it simply a convention that has been handed down to use through musical history?
",Noldorin,https://music.stackexchange.com/users/179,"This is a great question that is subtlely different from the usual ""what is the difference between A♭ and G♯?"" Apart from frequency differences in non-12-et tunings, that question relates to the function of the note within the chord/scale/key.

But if we're talking about choice of key, then there are other factors at work. Obviously in non-12-et tunings, the choice of A♭ major vs G♯ major does have to do with how it will sound. But let's assume 12-et for the rest of this answer.

There are three general factors that, I would have thought (but see below about Bach), led a composer in the common practice era to choose one key over another enharmonic one:


avoid double sharps and double flats in the key signature itself
reduce double sharps and double flats in the keys to be modulated to
reduce double sharps and double flats in the keys used by transposed instruments 


As others have mentioned, the Well-Tempered Clavier is interesting here. The point of the piece was to demonstrate the 12-major and 12-minor keys on an instrument where enharmonic notes have the same frequency. So frequency-wise there really can only be 12 major keys.

But from a naming point of view (assuming you wouldn't be as crazy as to have double sharps or double flats in your tonic) you have 21 possible key names for each of major and minor.

How would one go about choosing which 12 key names out of 21 to use? First step might be to avoid double sharps and double flats in the key signature itself. Note that the result is different between major and minor keys (as WTC demonstrates). That reduces your choice from 21 to 15 (so G♯ D♯ A♯ E♯ B♯ F♭ majors are out)

Then it likely just comes down to what you're going to modulate too. If you are going to modulate to V, you might want to avoid having to introduce the double-sharp to do so (which means C♯ major is out). If you are going to modulate to V of V, then F♯ might be out too).

All that said, it makes it particular interesting that WTC does use C♯ major and F♯ major and instead eschews D♭ G♭ C♭ to get from 15 possibilities to 12. The C♯ major prelude and fugue does indeed need a double-sharp in modulated passages, even though the note is diatonic.

",Patrick87,https://rpg.stackexchange.com/users/8737,"Yes, If it's a Dragon

The lone case I know of in the rules that talks about this is Dragonhide Armor. You use a dragon's scales to make it, and the armor can get properties from it. Here's the description (emphasis mine, as it's the relevant part):


  Armorsmiths can work with the hides of dragons to produce armor or
  shields of masterwork quality. One dragon produces enough hide for a
  single suit of masterwork hide armor for a creature one size category
  smaller than the dragon. By selecting only choice scales and bits of
  hide, an armorsmith can produce one suit of masterwork banded mail for
  a creature two sizes smaller, one suit of masterwork half-plate for a
  creature three sizes smaller, or one masterwork breastplate or suit of
  full plate for a creature four sizes smaller. In each case, enough
  hide is available to produce a light or heavy masterwork shield in
  addition to the armor, provided that the dragon is Large or larger. If
  the dragonhide comes from a dragon that had immunity to an energy
  type, the armor is also immune to that energy type, although this does
  not confer any protection to the wearer. If the armor or shield is
  later given the ability to protect the wearer against that energy
  type, the cost to add such protection is reduced by 25%.


That's about it.

Which of these are properties of the skin, and which are properties of the creature itself?

Properties are that of the creature as a whole. Skinning a Drow and wearing it does not confer it's Spell Resistance on you. Somehow capturing part of an Air Elemental and eating it doesn't let you turn into a Whirlwind (although it might give you an upset stomach). Etc.

The exception is Dragonhide, which is mentioned specifically in the rules.

Would such properties persist in the skin after removal (and tanning, I assume)?

Aside from Dragonhide, this is going to be DM interpretation. Does a Drow's right hand have Spell Resistance if severed? I really have no idea, and the rules don't say.

Would tanning/crafting produce armor, a wondrous item, a trophy, or what?

There's precedent for using hides to produce armor (Dragonhide, and ""Hide Armor"" in general). So if your DM rules that a bear hide has some special property, you could use it to get armor crafted, sure. But that requires such a ruling to work, by RAW the only time it works for armor is Dragonhide. You would also still have to have someone use the hide to make the armor with Craft: Armor.

Wondrous Items by the rules can only be produced with the Craft Wondrous Item feat. You could use whatever you skinned as the base of that item, but you'd still have to use the feat and pay the appropriate costs to make it magical.

As for a trophy... I don't see any reason why Craft: Taxidermy (or Profession: Taxidermist if your DM prefers) couldn't be used to make trophies. And hey, they look awesome on the wall of your base of operations. :)

There are a few cases (as Eric B mentioned) where an item might have a listed value. In that case, you could harvest the item and sell it. If it doesn't have a listed value, it's worthless unless your DM decides otherwise. (Maybe the leatherworkers in the area really like working with Dire Wolf pelts and will pay for them.)

The exception is Dragonhide, which is mentioned specifically in the rules.

Would such properties persist in the skin after removal (and tanning, I assume)?

Aside from Dragonhide, this is going to be DM interpretation. Does a Drow's right hand have Spell Resistance if severed? I really have no idea, and the rules don't say.

Would tanning/crafting produce armor, a wondrous item, a trophy, or what?

There's precedent for using hides to produce armor (Dragonhide, and ""Hide Armor"" in general). So if your DM rules that a bear hide has some special property, you could use it to get armor crafted, sure. But that requires such a ruling to work, by RAW the only time it works for armor is Dragonhide. You would also still have to have someone use the hide to make the armor with Craft: Armor.

Wondrous Items by the rules can only be produced with the Craft Wondrous Item feat. You could use whatever you skinned as the base of that item, but you'd still have to use the feat and pay the appropriate costs to make it magical.

As for a trophy... I don't see any reason why Craft: Taxidermy (or Profession: Taxidermist if your DM prefers) couldn't be used to make trophies. And hey, they look awesome on the wall of your base of operations. :)

There are a few cases (as Eric B mentioned) where an item might have a listed value. In that case, you could harvest the item and sell it. If it doesn't have a listed value, it's worthless unless your DM decides otherwise. (Maybe the leatherworkers in the area really like working with Dire Wolf pelts and will pay for them.)

5890,5890,9331,How to disable the shape toggle hotkey in Windows Chinese Input method?,"In any version of Windows I have used so far (Xp, Vista, 7, 8) and all versions of the MSPY IME (RTM versions and the 2010 version)
There is this annoying bug that you cannot change or disable the hotkey for Chinese shape troggle (normal to double spaced chars).
The default is Shift+Space, and cannot be changed from the language input settings pane in the control panel.
Here are a couple screenshots to show the problem:



After that press Change Key Sequence

This dialog will appear:



Disabling it, has no effect, i.e. Windows will ignore the setting.
You will notice I already managed to change the sequence to Shift-None by using the registry, but Windows still uses Shift+Space for shape toggle, which is really annoying when you type Chinese faster (especially if you want to switch between English and Chinese).

Now after you changed or deleted the key with the dialogue, the setting will not be persistent with hitting Apply. Changing the corresponding registry value and rebooting also doesn't help, as the following screenshot demonstrates:



I hope anyone has experience with this problem.
",Sebastian Godelet,https://superuser.com/users/41264,"Why can't you change the Shift+Space combination to some unlikely combination

This is not the same as totally disabling it, but it will liberate at least the space-bar.

As more experimentation, I believe that this key-combination is defined in the registry at :
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel\Input Method\Hot Keys\00000011.

Export this registry-key to a .reg file and change the following items :
Key Modifiers to ""00 C0 00 00"", meaning no ""Control"" or ""Shift"" or ""Alt"".
Virtual Key to 0, meaning ""None"".

If this does not work, maybe a more forceful action is required, such as totally deleting the 00000011 key. Unfortunately also, this thread claims that Windows will reset these keys
as soon as they are changed, which you can verify on your computer,

(The above is based on Simplified Chinese MSPY 3.0 IME Hot Key Registry Settings.)

A reboot is required to be absolutely sure that any such change had an effect.
Create also, as a safety measure, a system quite-point before modifying the registry.

[EDIT]

It seems like Windows will not suffer a change to the above registry keys, so any changes
are immediately nullified.

The only working solution is to use AutoHotkey to replace the Shift+Space combination to something else.

4143,4143,6611,Equivalent Key Signatures,"I've noticed that a variety of pieces in the classical repetoire (certainly at least the piano repetoire), label what seems to be effectively the same key signature differently. That is, I am not aware of any differences in terms of key between a piece in ""G Sharp major"" and ""A flat major"" (or their equivalent minors). Is there any reason that sometimes a sharped key signature is used while at other times the equivalent flatted key signature is used?

As a related point, I have undoubtedly noticed the preference of certain ""equivalent"" key signatures over others. For example, one encounters ""E flat"" significantly more than ""D sharp"" and likewise ""C sharp"" significantly more than ""D flat"". Is there any particular reason for this, or is it simply a convention that has been handed down to use through musical history?
",Noldorin,https://music.stackexchange.com/users/179,"The short (and oversimplified) answer is: Because Ab Major has fewer flats than G# Major has sharps, and thus it's easier for musicians to read.  This becomes especially apparent with keys such as D# Major, which has a double-sharp in it---the seventh note of the D# Major scale is not D, but Cx (that's ""C double-sharp"").

The longer and more accurate answer is that these keys are not in fact equivalent.  Only in an equal-tempered tuning system do G# and Ab have the same pitch, Eb and D# have the same pitch, etc.  That is, only in equal temperament do enharmonically equivalent notes actually have the same pitch.  In every other tuning system, the enharmonically equivalent notes are slightly (but definitely noticeably) different from each other.  If you've only been exposed to fixed-pitch instruments such as the piano and the guitar, this concept can be challenging at first, but violinists, wind, and brass players know that their intonation depends on the context of the key in which they're playing.

This in turn leads to different keys having different sonic characteristics.  In the modern, equal-tempered era, we've mostly lost these distinctions, but to composers of two hundred years ago and more, the keys of Ab and G# didn't sound the same at all, and they would compose to a specific key in order to take advantage of its particular character.

4830,4830,7677,Does the original jutsu user feel anything when a shadow clone is dispersed forcefully?,"According to the wiki,


  While the technique can be extremely beneficial, attempting to use multiple clones for training purposes can be mentally harmful to the user, as not only is all the experience collected by the user, but so is all the mental stress from training each clone


Now, when a clone is destroyed, there must be some mental stress involved. So does Naruto (or anyone else) feel anything when their shadow clones are dispersed? 

Nothing has been shown to indicate this (at least in the anime). I was wondering why this would not be applicable.

5091,5091,8098,"With estimates of mass constraints on magnetic monopoles, how likely is one to be found by the LHC(MoEDAL)?","Fermilab seems to have ruled out monopoles with mass less than 850 GeV, but I have seen some estimates of the mass thought to be in the order of up to $10^{18}$ GeV, which, of course, would make them undetectable in any accelerators. By 2013, the LHC is scheduled to reach up to 14 TeV. The only disputed sighting of a cosmic ray produced magnetic monopole was in 1982 when Blas Cabrera reported discovering one (Valentine event monopole). This has never been duplicated. CERN has set up the Monopole and Exotics Detector MOEDAL. Other experiments set up to detect them are the Antarctic Impulsive Transient Antenna--ANITA, and the Antarctic Muon And Neutrino Detection Array, aka AMANDA. While both of these detected neutrinos, neither detected magnetic monopoles (looking for Cerenkov radiation produced by products of monopole interaction).
Another method of detection is to look for induced current in a superconducting ring when a monopole passes through.
Joseph Polchinski called the existence of monopoles “one of the safest bets that one can make about physics not yet seen.” This shows some optimism on his part that one will be seen. Is there any reason or way to limit the mass of the monopole on the upside to 14 TEV or less?
",Gordon ,https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/1495,"Dear Gordon, Polchinski didn't imply anything about the lightness of the monopoles. You are overinterpreting what he said: his statement was an in-principle statement by a theorist. Just to be sure, the MoEDAL collaboration has overinterpreted him, too: he has never suggested that an experiment of their kind will find the beast. Still, it's very important to know whether such qualitatively different particles exist even if we think it's very likely that they won't be directly detected in the near (or far) future. Most of the top contemporary state-of-the-art theoretical physics deals with objects that will probably never be detected by direct experiments, for obvious financial and technological limitations.

Directly experimentally, the lower bound on the mass is just 500 GeV or so, but when some theory is wisely added, the mass is pretty much required to be exponentially higher than the TeV scale. In particular, some kind of unification seems necessary to allow the magnetic monopoles, and unification such as GUT can only appear at very high scales, such as the GUT scale of $10^{16}$ GeV: that's where the electromagnetic $U(1)$ may be embedded in a larger group that allows a topologically nontrivial solution (the $SU(2)$ of the weak interactions is not enough - it doesn't contain the hypercharge which has to be twisted as well). So it's unlikely that direct detection succeeds. Inflation has probably diluted the concentration of those massive magnetic monopoles to a very tiny number.

That player realises there was a better card to play, or that the spell will do something they don't want to happen, such as deal enough damage to that player to kill them.

",Marath the commander,https://boardgames.stackexchange.com/users/7225,"Depends on what you mean by ""misused"".

If the card was cast illegally, such as trying to Shock a creature with Hexproof, the game is rewound to the point immediately before the spell was cast. This does depend on how much time has passed- if so much time has passed that fixing it would be difficult, just correct anything currently illegal and continue the game.

If a player just did something silly, like trying to Shock a creature that actually had 3 toughness because of a Glorious Anthem, the answer is no in any tournament setting. Once you've taken an action, you can't suddenly change your mind. In casual play, it's up to the opponent. If the opponent decides it's sporting to allow take-backs, they can allow them.

Brewing that potion takes several weeks/months/whatever. She had plenty of time to rest. I think that this proves that the longer a potion takes to be made, the least exhausting it is, because most of the time it consumes is, well, waiting rather than casting spells on it too frequently.

3802,3802,6045,Earth-Moon orbiting each other after being engulfed by Red Giant,"Recently some exoplanets were discovered which are thought to be the leftover cores of giant planets that had survived a star becoming a Red Giant and then shrinking back to a subdwarf.

If giant planet cores can last the lifetime of a Red Giant, then maybe smaller planets can survive at least for a while.

When the Sun becomes Red Giant, if the Sun engulfs the Earth and Moon before they have evaporated, what will happen to the Earth-Moon orbit ? Will they be crashed into each other, or will they drift apart or will the orbit remain stable for a while before they are melted and evaporated away?

Edit: Newly found planets are 'roasted remains' BBC News, 21 December 2011

Edit: More planetary systems around white dwarfs (WD 0421+162 and WD 0431+126) that shows signs of planets being consumed by the stars.  http://news.discovery.com/space/alien-life-exoplanets/hubble-discovers-planet-graveyard-130509.htm

I'd guess you're talking about the planet orbiting V391 Pegasi, and this does seem to have originally orbited at about the Earth's orbit. However it's much much heavier than the Earth so there would have been more of it to evaporate and it would survive longer than the Earth. We don't know exactly what the planet's original orbit was, or how big V391 Pegasi got during it's red dwarf phase, and we don't know how much of the planet was evaporated.

I played more and found a more weird thing. See the 2nd screen shot, I choose the ""Prompt users to create a site collection under any managed path"" (red circle), when I click add new site, it works:



See the site collection url, http://my_host.com/my/my_test_site_collection ? I do not understand what the difference between this and the choice in the 1st screen shot (if I give it a name my_test_site_collection).

3823,3823,6081,Changing PhD topic and effect on career,"I'm a PhD student in my third year (4-6 is common in my country) and seriously consider abandoning my current topic. 
The new topic is in the same general field (CS related), yet in a vastly different domain and would need a quite different methods. My advisor suggested this switch, he could keep me funded in both cases, yet probably better with the new topic.

Arguments for switching are both personal interest in the new topic (it's recently trending, I was interested from the beginning, yet few positions were available) and lack of progress in the current area:


I could produce some publications, yet not up to my advisors expectations (should be easier with the new topic, given the impact factors of the journals my advisor suggested)
For the last 6-8 month I made barely any progress (lots of failed experiments)
I would probably have to abandon my current methods anyway due to 1./2., so half a year or so will be lost learning new methods no matter how I decide


Yet I shy away from switching, mainly due to already being quite old (combination of personal problems and a switch of my major as an undergraduate) and fearing how my C.V. would look if I did take about a year longer and had this second switch...

Thanks for any input.

This sounds like you have not treated your prelims as a contract negotiation. 

The best advice I've received is that when you pitch your thesis topic to the committee, make sure that everyone agrees on the structure and methodologies involved. That way, if your work falters or your experiments fail, but you followed the guidance outlined by your committee, then you have still earned a pass.

Another piece of great advice is this: nobody is going to read your thesis. 

Do not switch your program and do not start over, just complete the tasks you were given and move on. If you decide to switch fields later on, fine... that's normal, reasonable, and expected.

And just because you're studying one thing in school doesn't mean that's what you have to do for the rest of your life. There have been plenty of PhDs that completely jumped fields of study, out of CS and into sociology for example... or vice versa. Besides, the latest rage these days is adding ""multi-disciplinary"" to your grant proposals.

3978,3978,6350,blank page shows up after adding \usepackage[pdfpagelabels]{hyperref},"I have index.tex that I made a copy of it. renamed the copy to index_bad.tex, and added the line

to its preamble. So the 2 files are identical other than this one change.

Then compiled index.tex with pdflatex 3 time and looked at the index.pdf, and it is ok. (i.e. no blank page).

Compiled index_bad.tex with pdflatex 3 times. Now index_bad.pdf has an extra blank page inserted between first section and the second section.

When including hyperref a blank page shows up between first section, and the second section.  No blank page shows up when this package is not included.

question is why does this happen? and how to fix it?

Since this document includes 2 images and large verbatim, I've zipped the whole folder so it is all self contained. 

Unziping the zip file will create a folder. Inside the folder there is index.tex and index_bad.tex and the 2 images used. Running pdflatex on the files will show the problem above.

Package hyperref has to add anchors for the \section commands (otherwise the links would not have targets to jump to). It hooks into \refstepcounter for setting the anchor. Thus the example can be reduced to:

  For an odd prime, prove that a primitive root of $p^2$ is also a primitive root of $p^n$ for $n&gt;1$.  


I have proved the other way round that any primitive root of $p^n$ is also a primitive root of $p$ but I have not been able to solve this one. I have tried the usual things that is I have assumed the contrary that there does not exist the primitive root following the above condition and then proceeded but couldn't solve it.

",justice league,https://math.stackexchange.com/users/39323,"Let us give a more elementary answer, while still using some binomial theorem. But we shall employ no more than a binomial lemma. It states that, for a prime $p$, and an integer $1\leq a\leq p-1$, we have $p\mid \binom{p}{a}$.
Now you know that $a$ is a primitive root of $p^2$, so the order of $a$ modulo $p^2$ is $p(p-1)$. And we know that $a^{p-1}=1+kp$ for some $k$. Then the assumption that $a$ is a primitive root of $p^2$ implies that $k$ is not divisible by $p$. Therefore $$a^{p^n(p-1)}=(a^{p-1})^{p^n}=1+kp^{n+1}+mp^{n+2}$$ for some $m$.(This is the place where we make use of the binomial lemma.) This directly tells you that $a$ is a primitive root of $p^n$ for every $n\ge1$.  


   More Details.  We elaborate upon two things: Firstly, we show the centered equation, and, secondly, we show how that implies the primitivity of $a$.  For the first, use the lemma to deduce that $(a^{p-1})^{p}=1+kp\times p+\text{terms of higher powers of $p$}$. Now, by induction, the result follows. For the second, just divide $(a^{p-1})^{p^r}$ by $p^n$ for $k=0,1,\ldots,n-1$, to see that, for lower powers of $a$ than $(a^{p-1})^{p^{n-1}}$, it cannot be congruent to $1$ modulo $p^n$. So $a$ is indeed a primitive root of $p^n$.

5437,5437,8630,Sloshing Sound Under Dash,"I have a 2011 Suzuki SX4 Crossover AWD with MT.  Sometimes when I start it up, begin moving forward, or quickly decelerate I can hear what sounds like water (or some other liquid) moving from one place to another (can't quite tell where) under the dash or maybe just behind the firewall.  I took it to the Suzuki service center (almost 2 hour drive from my home), and they told me that the A/C coolant was low.  They refilled it and sent me on my way.  However, I still hear the sloshing sound behind the dash.  Does anyone have any ideas on what this might be?  Thanks.

ADDITIONAL INFO

I've recently noticed that when this ""running water"" sound occurs that it is more prominent when the engine is running faster (e.g. during acceleration).  This leads me to believe maybe this has something to do with the water pump, or some other liquid pump, that is run by the engine and not moving enough liquid to fill the pipe, hence a sloshing / running water sound.
",Jim Fell,https://mechanics.stackexchange.com/users/1211,"My experience (in multiple cars, albeit not your make/model) has been that this sound always means your cooling system is under-filled. If you've emptied your cooling system and refilled it, it can be really hard to get all the air pockets out of the heater core, especially since in many vehicles it's almost as high as the radiator cap and at the opposite end of the system. The best system I know of is to park on a steep grade with the front of the car facing upward, then let the engine run with the radiator cap off. Squeezing the hoses, especially the hoses near the back of the engine compartment that go to the heater core, and varying the throttle can help. You should get bubbles coming up the top of the radiator. Whenever the fluid level drops, add some more coolant, and repeat until you can't get any more bubbling.

By the way, another symptom that might indicate this is your problem is that it's usually associated with poor heater performance (taking a long time to get heat, or only getting warm air, not hot air, out of the heater).

4108,4108,6558,Intuition Behind a Decimal Representation with Catalan Numbers,"From $0 = 0.5 - 0.5 = 0.5 - \sqrt{0.25}$, we can adjust the subtrahend slightly to obtain

$$0.5 - \sqrt{0.249} = 0.001\ 001\ 002\ 005\ 014\ 042\ldots$$

where the decimal representation contains the first few Catalan numbers: $1, 1, 2, 5, 14, 42 
\ldots$

We can see even more Catalan numbers (albeit spaced apart with more $0$s) by using more $9$s. 

(For example, check the decimal representation of $0.5 - \sqrt{0.24999999999}$.)

My question is not how to show this formally; it is a straightforward problem to show how one derives, e.g., the decimal representation given above. (I'll include a derivation below for anyone who doesn't want to think this through her/himself.)

Instead, my question is: why would it make sense, intuitively, for the Catalan numbers to show up in these decimal representations?



Derivation:

Recall that the generating function for the Catalan numbers $c(x)$ satisfies $c(x) = 1 + xc(x)^2$. Rearranging, we find that $c(x) = \frac{2}{1 + \sqrt{1 - 4x}}.$ Then

$$\sum_{n = 0}^{\infty}\frac{C_n}{10^{3n + 3}} = \frac{1}{1000}\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{C_n}{1000^{n}} = x \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}C_n x^n = xc(x) = \frac{2x}{1 + \sqrt{1 - 4x}},$$

where we have simplified our computations by letting $x = \frac{1}{1000}$.

Evaluating at this value of $x$ yields $0.5 - \sqrt{0.249}$.

  My question is how to configure the pins so that: 1) Pin is high, led wont burn. 2) Pin is low, led will burn.


If you configure a pin as output, setting it to low will sink current and setting it to low will source current. As long as the Vcc supplying your LEDs is the same as the controller Vcc, you circuit should work as expected.

The atmega32 can safely sink/source about 20mA per IO. However, there are limitations regarding the total maximum per port and for all ports combined. It depends on the package type. For PDIP its about 100mA max per port and 200mA max total. Take a look at the ""DC characteristics"" section in the data sheet.

So using 4 LEDs as illustrated should work fine (assuming about 20mA per LED).

2513,2513,4009,Roots of this third degree polynomial,"I've got the following polynomial
$$
x^3-6x^2-2x+40
$$
and I want to find its roots. The only option I see at the moment is to compute all the divisors of $40$ and their inverse, and manually check if it's result is $0$. This works, because $4$ is a zero and now we can divide the polynomial by the factor $x-4$, resulting in a second degree polynomial (which is easier to solve).

I was wondering if there's any other method/idea to manually find the roots of this polynomial?
",ABC,https://math.stackexchange.com/users/91270,"For polynomial of degree $3$ you can use the following procedure. Assume that you guessed the solution $x_1=4$ (indeed $4^3-6\cdot 4^2-2\cdot 4+40 = 64 -96-8+40 =0)$. 

You can use Horner's method to get the polynomial $p(x)=p_2x^2+p_1x+p_0$ such that $(x-4)\cdot p(x) = x^3-6x^2-2x+40$. You want to do that because $p(x)$ will be a polynomial of degree $2$ and it is easy (see here ) to find the solutions of such polynomial. In your case you have (with Horner's method)

$$\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|}\hline&amp;1&amp;-6&amp;-2&amp;40\\\hline 4&amp;0&amp;1\cdot 4=4&amp;-2\cdot 4=-8&amp;-10\cdot 4=-40\\\hline&amp;0+1=\color{blue}{\underbrace{1}_{:=p_2}}&amp;-6+4=\color{blue}{\underbrace{-2}_{:=p_1}}&amp;-2-8=\color{blue}{\underbrace{-10}_{:=p_0}}&amp;40-40=\color{red}0\\\hline\end{array}$$

So your polynomial becomes $p(x) = \color{blue}1\cdot x^2\color{blue}{-2}\cdot x\color{blue}{-10}= x^2-2x-10$. The remainder, as you can see, is $\color{red}0.$ The solutions to this polynomial are

$$x_{2,3}=\dfrac{2\pm2\sqrt{11}}{2}=1\pm11$$

The solutions are therefore $x_{1,2,3}=4,1+\sqrt{11},1-\sqrt{11}$.

102,102,168,Why is the potential function defined differently in physics and calculus?,"I am very familiar with the concept of a potential function, and potential energy, from calculus-based physics.

For instance, if we have the familiar force field $\mathbf{F} = -mg \,\mathbf{j}$, then a potential function is given by $U = mgy + C$. (Since potential energy is relative, we have an infinite number of potential functions.)

Notice that the gradient of the potential function is the negative of the force field: $$\nabla U = \nabla(mgy + C) = mg \,\mathbf{j} = -\mathbf{F}.$$

That was perfectly fine with me. But now in vector calculus, I am reading that the potential function $f$ of a vector function $\mathbf{F}$ is such that $\nabla f = \mathbf{F}$. A negative sign appears to have been lost when migrating from physics to calculus.

It seems confusing to call $f$ a ""potential function"", since it cannot be interpreted as potential energy in the real world. So why is the calculus nomenclature as it is (i.e., why not call this something else and then say the potential function is the negative of it)?
",Radon Rosborough,https://math.stackexchange.com/users/160658,"After reading further on in my calculus textbook, I found that they later defined the potential energy as the negative of the potential function.

So it appears that the reasoning presented in my question was correct, but that some sources simply use a slightly different definition for ""potential function"" – not because it corresponds to potential energy, but because a convenient name is needed for it.

Wikipedia says that the gradient of the potential is the negative of the vector field, but that ""In some cases, mathematicians may use a positive sign in front of the gradient to define the potential.""

EDIT: Ok so the wheel was replaced due to hitting a stump at night time, the cables were getting old, it has had plenty of action, but was well looked after. The rear sus has a tiny bit of play in the top bush (not enough to realise when riding)

It also has a leaking front fork, not a big issue (probably new seal, or not worry), but makes me wonder if it is worth it, will cost around $400 US ish, do you think it will have other issues?

If the bike has been ridden regularly you will be wanting a well maintained one. This means parts replaced as they wear out or get damaged.

4008,4008,6400,Are there any differences in how new vs. well-established professors select students?,"For any professors out there, do you feel that there are any differences in how you selected and recruited students from the time when you were newly hired, to a well-established stage (i.e. after getting tenure)? I'm asking this out of curiosity. There are oftentimes questions about whether students should choose a new/old advisor, but I haven't seen any that asked about this from the prof's perspective.

I would assume there are since the challenges and priorities for the two groups are normally somewhat different, but I'm not sure exactly how it would differ. For instance, it might be more difficult for the new PI to recruit students (especially good ones) when they have to ""compete"" with older, better funded peers. This would lead one to think that new PIs might be more likely to take on students they might not necessarily love, but just need bodies in the lab. However, on the other hand, new PIs are more likely to have limited funding, and if they are on the tenure-track, would need their few students to succeed in order to establish a name for themselves in the industry. In this case, it would be detrimental if they chose the wrong student(s) in the beginning, especially if they are limited to the number of students they can afford due to funding issues. I realize that this is field and situation specific, but I'm looking to hear stories/insights from people who have gone through/know about the process.

Thanks!

4249,4249,6776,Is it an absolute must that we ignore/delete all compiled files before committing?,"I am working on a Drupal theme. I am going to be using ""intermediary"" languages to develop it, ie Stylus for styles, and CoffeeScript for some of the front-end scripts.

I am going to be using a git hosting service to be able to share the code among colleges. I am also going to be using it to update the code locally and then push onto hosting service, to be later pulled by the live drupal site.

This makes things really elegant.

However, I have noticed that a lot of developers tend to .gitignore all compiled code.

If it were a good practice, I would've loved to follow it, if and only if there wasn't this one issue: recompiling all the code that is needed in order for the theme to work out correctly.

This means that when I do a pull, I will have to recompile all the CSS and JavaScript code. Now, if I were to do a pull on the live site, there's a risk that a user goes to the site right at the moment I do the pull. No styles and scripts will be loaded on the user's end, so long as the code hasn't compiled.

Of course, compiling takes about a second, and the user might probably think to him/herself ""meh, it was just my internet connection.""

But there is also the issue that the server doesn't have the compilers installed to begin with. So now, I would do a pull, but there will be no styles, and no scripts.

Is it an absolute must that I delete all compiled code, or can I go ahead and include them in the commit?

75,75,118,"Can you send data usefully over one wire, literally one wire?","It is possible to design networking systems that only use two wires: one for data and one for a common ground. Examples include 1-wire and Pin&amp;Play. These are called single wire systems because the requirement for an earth wire is implied too. But you can also get systems to extend home networks that use the home earth to connect network points, like Power Line Communication. How is this possible over just one wire?

== EDIT ==

From the answers (thanks!) I think I failed to word this question clearly. Let me try again.

Can you send data usefully over one wire, literally one wire? Radio is zero, 1-wire is two, but is it possible with one? ""No, and here's why"" or ""Yes, here's how it is done in X"" are the kind of answers I am hoping for.

(N.B. I'll also change the question title from ""Single wire systems need two wires; so how does ethernet over ground work?"" to ""Can you send data usefully over one wire, literally one wire?"")
",dumbledad,https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/10772,"EDIT - because of the reshaping of the question. my answer at the bottom isn't that relevant. To the edited question: -


  ""Can you send data usefully over one wire, literally one wire?""


My answer is ""Not with any level of success"". Reasoning - if you are sending signals you need a forward and a return path for the current. If the return path is tenuously connected (such as through the ground), any ground interference in the vicinity of the return path adds to the signal received and has a tendency to corrupt that signal. However, couldn't the ground be classed as a wire? Avoiding this issue, if there were a tenuous ground connection that is validated as not adding an extra wire, the answer could be ""Yes"" providing the transmitted signal was powerful enough to overcome natural and unnatural interference in the vicinity of the return path.

If the signal were RF and transmitted via ""a single wire"" such as an antenna you could argue the answer is ""Yes"" but would the receiving antenna be counted as a wire making the RF argument null and void? Ultrasonic signalling or optical signalling don't need wires to make a connection so they are invalidated in my answer.

Answer to question before revision: -

I use zero-wire systems quite a lot - these receive their power and transmit data using NO (repeat NO) interconnecting wires. Data transmission is a little under 1Mb per second and of course for a (decent) network that is dreadful. Ditto for powerline comms and 1-wire and Pin&amp;Play (worst of the lot).

If you want a decent high-speed network then wide-bandwidth systems are required and twisted pair is needed to get any reasonable distance between offices. WiFi is good but this uses sophisticated modulation techniques and radio to achieve high-speed - the ones in your home haven't got a lot of range though.

Yes you can design networking systems that only use two wires but they would be significantly faster and less-prone to errors if they were a balanced pair. You can even phantom power equipment connected to them just like 1-wire (2 really) does.

Don't be hoodwinked by all the marketing up-front blurb

The first table has is the dump file for all invoices and the intems bought

Now i want to find the No. of items bought given the condition that the brand is Coca-Cola, the SKU is 200ml and the invoice no. is XAX1X2X3 and display it in another cell.



Now in the second table, i want to match the invoice with the pack size and brand from first table and put the quantity in the empty cell

So the row that is highlighted in table 2 will show the value 3 cause invoice T1411031400114, pack size 200, brand coca-cola has Qty as 3.

Up till now I'm using an open source tool GIMP to create the concepts and mock ups of the websites I design.I know that Photoshop is the Industry standard(at least as far as I know).

So,what books can help me in learning some advanced Photoshop techniques used frequently in web designing.Also I want to learn how to draw cartoon characters like this.I know it is a matter of creativity but still there must be some techniques which I can learn.Please express your views.

I apologize for slightly derailing the question, but I feel that Illustrator is a tool much better suited for web work than Photoshop—it's more maintainable and intuitive, once you've gotten past the initial unfamiliarity that comes from working with vector files instead of raster files.

113,113,182,"How to determine if a matrix is positive/negative definite, having complex eigenvalues?","I am trying to deal with an issue: I am trying to determine the nature of some points, that's why I need to check in Matlab if a matrix with complex elements is positive or negative definite. After performing some research, I came to the following two methods:


Calculate the eigenvalues and see if it is positive/negative;

    eig(matrix)


If the eigenvalues are positive => matrix is positive definite;
Else, if eigenvalues are negative => matrix is negative definite;
Use the following function:

    [R P] = chol(matrix)


If p is 0 => you have a positive definite matrix; otherwise, your matrix is NOT positive definite.


My problem is that I have two complex eigenvalues (and  my symmetric matrix has complex elements), therefore, method 1 doesn't help me to draw any conclusion. And the method 2, doesn't give me information whether the matrix is negative definite or indefinite, because it tests only if the matrix is positive definite or not, therefore, doesn't solve my problem.

Does any one have any idea how I can check if a matrix with complex eigenvalues is positive or negative definite with other methods than the mentioned ones? Thank you.

LATER EDIT:

My function is: 11.*x1 + 22.*x1.^2.*x2 + x2.^2 + 31.*x1.^2;

I have done the partial derivative with respect to x1, x2 and I have equalized all the obtained relations with 0. Therefore, I have obtained the following system:

62*x1 + 44*x1*x2 + 11 = 0

22*x1^2 + 2*x2 = 0

from here, I got x1 having the following possible values: 
{0.333, -0.1025 + 0.2403i, -0.1025 - 0.2403i} 
and x2 having the following values: 
{-1.22, 0.5197 + 0.5417i,  0.5197 - 0.5417i}

My Hessian looks something like:

( 62+44*x2                 44*x1)

( 44*x1                    2    )

After taking the 3 possible pairs of (x1,x2) I obtain three values for the Hessian matrix. For the first (x1,x2) pair everything is ok => I have a saddle, since I have 2 real eigenvalues of opposite signs. The difficulties comes with the others, because intuitively I would say that we cannot determine the nature of those points, but I came across to the following idea, while surfing the internet for finding an explanation:

-if A belongs to Mn(C) and 

1) Re(x_star * A * x) > 0 => A positive definite.

2) Re(x_star * A * x) &lt; 0 => A negative definite.

(according to http://mathworld.wolfram.com/PositiveDefiniteMatrix.html)

So, I am a bit confused :-?

When the second Doctor changes to the third (from Patrick Troughton to Jon Pertwee in ""The War Games, Part Ten"" (1969)), it is forced on him as punishment before being exiled to earth. The Doctor was not critically injured or dying. The transformation was the Time Lords doing.

Does this really count as one of the 12 regenerations? 
",Keo,https://scifi.stackexchange.com/users/16220,"Yes, that was regeneration.

There is no indication in Old Who or the New Series that regeneration is exclusively limited to being uncontrollably triggered by fatal events.

Although regeneration is usually seen in the show as an ""emergency fail-safe"" feature, we're also shown very explicitly that most Time Lords choose to regenerate for reasons other than imminent death. Romana is the most prominent example, although Borusa also comes to mind (the man seems to have gone through bodies like some people go through ties).

The Doctor just leads such a hard life that his regenerations come more violently than most Time Lords'.

The fact that it was forced on him by the Time Lords doesn't change anything either; the High Council has repeatedly been shown to have control over the regeneration technology (for example, offering the Master a new set of regenerations if he helped them in The Five Doctors). There's no reason to assume that the process they used to change the Second Doctor into the Third was not regeneration; in fact, their dialogue in that scene makes it clear that the process is identical to that which turned the First into the Second (though ""regeneration"" wasn't yet really a term being used by the show).

869,869,1378,Is it ethical to profit by having my students buy my textbook?,"This question was suggested to me by How can I sell my text book to my students in e-book format? which asked about the practicalities, but attracted many comments about the ethics.  So this question is to ask about the ethics directly.

Suppose I have written and published a textbook, and I want to use it as the text for a course I am teaching.  I receive royalties from each copy of my book that is sold, so if my students are required to buy my textbook for the course, I will make some money.  Is it ethical to do so?

Well-reasoned opinions would be useful answers, but even more useful would be pointers to institutional policies, professional codes of ethics, etc, that address this issue.

Of course, there are many ways to avoid profiting from the sale of my book to my students.  If my contract with my publisher allows it, I could distribute PDFs to my students, or have the university bookstore print out copies and sell them at cost.  Another approach I've heard of is to compute how much I earn in royalties on each copy, and refund that amount from my pocket to each student who buys a copy.  Or, use my royalty earnings to buy pizza for the class.  Certainly these are nice gestures, but I would like opinions on whether they are ethically required.

Edit: To address some questions that have arisen in the comments:


This question is hypothetical.  I haven't published any textbooks myself and have no immediate plans to do so.  In any case, my personal preference would be to make the book available to students for free, if at all possible.  So I've phrased this question in the first person for rhetorical convenience only.
I had intended the question to be only about the potential financial conflict of interest that could arise if I make money by assigning my own book.  Some of the answers feel that it is improper for me to assign my own textbook at all, whether I make money or not, but I don't think this point of view is prevalent within the academic community.  If it happens that my book (as a pithy but now-deleted comment put it) ""blows"", I think most would agree that my decision to assign it is pedagogically unfortunate, but not unethical.  
I don't literally mean that students would be required to buy the book, only that they'd be expected to have it.  I might assign readings or homework problems from the book, so that the student needs access to the book in order to do them, but they could certainly achieve this by getting a used copy or borrowing from a friend.  But probably most students would buy new copies anyway, since that is the most convenient way.

",Nate Eldredge,https://academia.stackexchange.com/users/1010,"Unethical

I think it is unethical to profit by having students buy your textbook because you're their lecturer and they expect you to inform them and provide them with some useful resources for learning. The students also usually get a bad feeling when you keep recommending your book unless it was vote one of the best to use in tackling the given subject. I don't know/understand how you may be able to provide other books to your students at no cost while you provide your book at a cost. It looks fishy. If you feel that you can't give each student a copy of the book then you can recommend the university to buy the books so as to restock the library or you can offer your own copy or a single donated copy strictly for class use. This depends on the number of students you're dealing with and how often they have to use the book.

Ethical

How can I sell my textbooks to my students in the form of e-books? It asks about practicality, but it brings a lot of comments about ethics. So the question is to ask ethical questions directly.","Unethical

I think it is unethical to profit by having students buy your textbook because you're their lecturer and they expect you to inform them and provide them with some useful resources for learning. The students also usually get a bad feeling when you keep recommending your book unless it was vote one of the best to use in tackling the given subject. I don't know/understand how you may be able to provide other books to your students at no cost while you provide your book at a cost. It looks fishy. If you feel that you can't give each student a copy of the book then you can recommend the university to buy the books so as to restock the library or you can offer your own copy or a single donated copy strictly for class use. This depends on the number of students you're dealing with and how often they have to use the book.

2371,2371,3781,What are the benefits of owning a physical book?,"I have seen this question about updates of the D&amp;D 4th Edition books, and it got me thinking.
Since I got my Kindle I have not read a single paper novel; they have fewer drawbacks compared to digital copies than rpg rulebooks.


Dead-tree types have some benefits like looking good on a bookshelf, but any ebook reader weighs less with 100 novels than the usual hard-cover book. 
If you want to look for the damage of Ares Alpha, even with a half-decent tablet it takes less than 2 seconds.  
Digital copies do not get worn, they never get unwanted earmarks, but you can bookmark them.
Rulebooks do get updates, and unless you are willing to take a pen to your book, your hard copies will never contain them. The pdfs can be edited and resent to the buyers. 
Even better is the WotC approach with the DDI, you can look up any monster or item or (almost any) rule, in the most recent form, for 3 years at the cost of seven books. 


I think this is the way to go, even considering the horribly slow character builder. Although I must admit good illustration can help build the athmosphere.

So what am I missing? Why are people buying rpg rulebooks in paper format? Why are books even published, I do not need to know if feats are supposed to be on the right page and skills on the left, I just want a list of them, filterable any way I want. 

Is this just a necessary part of earning money? I understand that pdfs are copied illegally, but the Compendium is not.

2722,2722,4337,Is it an absolute must that we ignore/delete all compiled files before committing?,"I am working on a Drupal theme. I am going to be using ""intermediary"" languages to develop it, ie Stylus for styles, and CoffeeScript for some of the front-end scripts.

I am going to be using a git hosting service to be able to share the code among colleges. I am also going to be using it to update the code locally and then push onto hosting service, to be later pulled by the live drupal site.

This makes things really elegant.

However, I have noticed that a lot of developers tend to .gitignore all compiled code.

If it were a good practice, I would've loved to follow it, if and only if there wasn't this one issue: recompiling all the code that is needed in order for the theme to work out correctly.

This means that when I do a pull, I will have to recompile all the CSS and JavaScript code. Now, if I were to do a pull on the live site, there's a risk that a user goes to the site right at the moment I do the pull. No styles and scripts will be loaded on the user's end, so long as the code hasn't compiled.

Of course, compiling takes about a second, and the user might probably think to him/herself ""meh, it was just my internet connection.""

But there is also the issue that the server doesn't have the compilers installed to begin with. So now, I would do a pull, but there will be no styles, and no scripts.

Is it an absolute must that I delete all compiled code, or can I go ahead and include them in the commit?

I have a client who's idea pretty much depends on being able to call a method inside the app whenever a user copies or cuts out a piece of text or an image, no matter whether the user is actually inside the app or not (though the app would be running in the background).

My initial guess would be no, but you never know. I haven't been able to find any clear information about it, so thought I should ask.

My astronomy teacher says that gravity is (note: not like) a 3D blanket and when you put mass on it, the mass causes a dip/dent in the blanket and so if you put another object with less mass it will roll down the dip onto the bigger mass. Is this true and is this what causes the centripetal force. 
",Jonathan.,https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/4,"Simple answer: gravity is a centripetal force, and can be envisaged clearly as such in Newtonian mechanics.

Centripetal just means a force that is ""radially inwards"" (""directed towards the centre""). The electric force, for example, is also clearly centripetal. (It's slightly harder to define ""centripetal"" for the magnetic force.)

56,56,83,Saving TinyMCE Base64 images with dragonfly,"I am using tinymce-rails-imageupload plugin with dragonfly.

When the image is uploaded via separate form in popup window, it behaves as expected (save image in datastore). 

But when the user drag-drop or paste image into TinyMCE, the imageupload plugin allows it. I tried to find a way to disable this behavior, but apparently there is no straightforward way to disable allowing image upload, while disallowing the past/drag-drop behavior. So I gave up on that..

Now, I'm trying to save BASE64 image in TinyMCE's content.

In controller:

def store_file
  @image = Resource.new :res_image =&gt; params[:file]
  @image.save
  render json: {
    image: {
      url: @image.res_image.remote_url
    }
  }, content_type: ""text/html""
end

def create
  @entry = Entry.new(params[:entry])

  # iterate through tinyMCE field params[:entry][:message]
    # if image tag is found
      # if value of src tag starts with ""data:""
        # then replace it with the output of
        # Resource.create_image_from_base64(extracted_base64_value)
      # end if
    # end if
  # end iteration

  begin
    @entry.save!
    flash[:success] = ""Entry was successfully created.""
    redirect_to entries_path
  rescue Mongoid::Errors::Validations =&gt; e
    render :action =&gt; ""new""
  end
end


In Resource model, I would have something like:

image_accessor :res_image

field :res_image_uid,      type: String
field :res_image_name,     type: String

def create_image_from_base64(base_64_encoded_data)
  file = File.open('temp.png', 'wb') do|f|
   f.write(Base64.decode64(base_64_encoded_data))
  end

  resource = # create Resource with temp file

  file.close

5732,5732,9081,Scatterplots for subsets of multivariate data [Updated],"Update/Re-write

There has been a lot of ambiguity over what i'm am trying to do with this question so I have decided to give it a full rewrite. I'm really sorry for the confusion. If you want to see the background please see the edit history. I hope things are clearer now..

I have some data made up into the following fashion:

datac =
  {
   data1 = RandomReal[1, {7, 3}],
   data2 = RandomReal[1, {13, 3}],
   data3 = RandomReal[1, {19, 3}],
   data4 = RandomReal[1, {16, 3}],
   data5 = RandomReal[1, {5, 3}]
   };


data1 through data5 are subsets of a multivariate dataset with 3 independent variables. data1, for example, is composed of 7 individual data points (each with 3 variables).

If I use the following function: 

Needs[""StatisticalPlots`""]
pairwisecol[data_, col_] := 
PairwiseScatterPlot[data, 
                      PlotStyle -&gt; col, 
                      DataTicks -&gt; True,  
                      DataLabels -&gt; {""x"", ""y"", ""z""}]


I can create a combined plot comparing the various subsets. E.g.

Show[{pairwisecol[data1, Red], 
      pairwisecol[data2, Blue], 
      pairwisecol[data3, Green],  
      pairwisecol[data4, Purple], 
      pairwisecol[data5, Orange]}]




This curently has the major drawbacks that each subset has to be defined and have a colour explicitly assigned to it. Also, Show in this instance overlays all of the DataTicks etc, rather than just the elements from the first plot (as is normally the case with Show[{Plot1,Plot2}]).

What I'm looking for is a way to use the whole (partitioned) dataset datac to generate such a plot/diagram. i.e. something like,

Show[pairwisecol[#, Red] &amp; /@ datac]


but, with Red being replaced by a series of colours to represent each subset (like in the plot shown).

...Alternatively, starting with a 2-level list e.g.

datap = RandomReal[1, {60, 3}];


and a definition of sublist partitions,

parts = {7, 13, 19, 16, 5};


or

partspos = {[[1;;7]], [[8;;20]], [[21;;39]], [[40;;55]], [[56;;60]]};


then defining a function something like:

pairwiseP[data_, partlist_] := ...


that would partition datap into appropriate sublists, create a series of PairwiseScatterPlot's (each with a different plot colour) and then combine them using Show. 

Note that this example has n = 3 independent variables. I am looking for a method that works for 1 &lt; n &lt; ~20.

Can anyone suggest how to do this?

3905,3905,6222,Trigger IP ban based on request of given file?,"I run a website where ""x.php"" was known to have vulnerabilities. The vulnerability has been fixed and I don't have ""x.php"" on my site anymore.

As such with major public vulnerabilities, it seems script kiddies around are running tools that hitting my site looking for ""x.php"" in the entire structure of the site - constantly, 24/7.

This is wasted bandwidth, traffic and load that I don't really need.

Is there a way to trigger a time-based (or permanent) ban to an IP address that tries to access ""x.php"" anywhere on my site?

Perhaps I need a custom 404 PHP page that captures the fact that the request was for ""x.php"" and then that triggers the ban? How can I do that?

Thanks!

EDIT:

I should add that part of hardening my site, I've started using ZBBlock:


  This php security script is designed
  to detect certain behaviors
  detrimental to websites, or known bad
  addresses attempting to access your
  site. It then will send the bad robot
  (usually) or hacker an authentic 403
  FORBIDDEN page with a description of
  what the problem was. If the attacker
  persists, then they will be served up
  a permanently reccurring 503 OVERLOAD
  message with a 24 hour timeout.


But ZBBlock doesn't do quite exactly what I want to do, it does help with other spam/script/hack blocking.

Since I've done that, I'm having a hard time getting the camera to focus and take photos in lower light.  I can hear it (and see it) hunting to focus, but the bottom right flashes the image suggesting I use the flash and it won't let me take a picture.

Often the exposure information on the screen shows me that I am close to perfect exposure (and sometimes just a bit underexposed).

What's going on?  Is there something wrong with the camera?  What other settings can I check?

ILDASM is a start, but not an end.  The key is: What will the JIT generate for assembly code?

Here's what you want to do.

Take a couple samples of what you are trying to look at.  Obviously you can wall-clock time them if you want - but I assume you want to know more than that.

Here's what's not obvious.  The C# compiler generates some MSIL sequences that are non-optimal in a lot of situations.  The JIT it tuned to deal with these and quirks from other languages.  The problem: Only 'quirks' someone has noticed have been tuned.

You really want to make a sample that has your implementations to try, returns back up to main (or wherever), Sleep()s, or something where you can attach a debugger, then run the routines again.

You DO NOT want to start the code under the debugger or the JIT will generate non-optimized code - and it sounds like you want to know how it will behave in a real environment.  The JIT does this to maximize debug info and minimize the current source location from 'jumping around'.  Never start a perf evaluation under the debugger.

OK.  So once the code has run once (ie: The JIT has generated code for it), then attach the debugger during the sleep (or whatever).  Then look at the x86/x64 that was generated for the two routines.

My gut tells me that if you are using ++i/i++ as you described - ie: in a stand alone expression where the rvalue result is not re-used - there won't be a difference.  But won't it be fun to go find out and see all the neat stuff! :)

741,741,1176,Adding existing user to existing group and providing permissions,"can someone shed some light on this issue

I've set up and installed vsftpd. Created a user ftp-user and created a home directory, so they can log in, and just have access to drop their files here.


>> sudo useradd -d /home/ftp/ftp-user -m ftp-user


This works fine, user successfully logs in over ftp, uploads a file.

I now need to be able to access this ftp-user directory as another user say for example ubuntu. There is a script that runs as ubuntu, and I need to be able to access the directory to be able to grab the files and copy them across to other locations.

I tried to add ubuntu to the ftp-user group:


sudo usermod -a -G ftp-user ubuntu


Although, when trying:

ubuntu
>> cd ftp-user/
>> -bash: cd ftp-user/: Permission denied

2080,2080,3312,Multiple orders in a single list,"I have a problem with a ranking system I am using.

Scenario:

An online game with around 10k players calculates a real time ranking of points when a certain event occurs. Events don't occur that often, around 1 time per minute. This ranking is kept in the cache for quick calculations, sorting and access.

Now players can form groups and play against each other, but the scoring system is the same, only the ranking is based for the players in that group.

At first I created for every group a separate ranking, effectively having the same scores as the complete ranking, but with different positions in the ranking.

This is trivial because there are over 1.000 groups and every time an event occurs all the groups would have to be updated.

So what I did now is when the group ranking is requested take only the players that are in that group from the complete ranking and show them. The positions would have to be re-counted.

That re-counting is where the problem is. Because the sub-list is by-reference from the complete ranking list I cannot change the position of the player in the sub-ranking without updating it in the complete ranking, because it's just a reference.

I came up with two solutions:


Create a copy from the record every time it is requested and do some output caching (not very desirable because the rankings are live)
Create a copy and store this in a cache which is reset when an event occurs.
Create a sub-list with just the positions which is updated when an event occurs.


And the last solution: do the position counting in the output instead in the business side. This would be the best solution, only problem is that on some pages this text appears: ""You are on position # in the ranking"" where # is your ranking position. This number would be tedious to get then.

Does anybody have any suggestions to this problem?
",YesMan85,https://programmers.stackexchange.com/users/24248,"As you say yourself, the best solution is to do the counting in the output, instead of storing it in the various lists. That way you don't have to store (and recalculate) the ranking numbers on each event for each (sub-)list, but you only calculate them when needed.

For the ""You are on position # in the ranking"" text, you could have a method in the class that represents the ranking list, like this: RankingList::getRankingOf(Player). Only if this information is costly to obtain and you only need the ranking from the overall list, you could consider caching the current ranking numbers in the overall list (as an optimisation strategy).

2819,2819,4488,What could be causing this sine on 7810 output when powering BLDC fan?,"I'm powering a 12 V computer fan with a simple 7810 circuit shown here:



When the fan is connected to the regulator, on the output I get this wave:



When I zoom out in time, I get something that looks like this:



For those who can't be bothered to click on the image, the distance between the peaks is almost 10 ms.

When I zoom out a bit more, I can see that there is another wave here riding on top of those peaks like this:



The higher top peaks have peak voltage of 13.4 V and the lower peaks are 12 V. The peaks on the bottom side which go together with 12 V peaks are 8.8 V and the bottom peaks of 13.4 V top peaks are 8.6 V.  

So any ideas what could be causing this? 

UPDATE

Here's the input waveform with the output peaks:



The input peaks are 10 ms apart and are in phase with AC line transitions, as expected since the AC frequency here is 50 Hz. The input is coming from a diode bridge rectifier. The input voltage is a bit high since I changed the original 1N4007 diodes with STPS2H100 Schottky diodes because I initially believed that one of the input diodes developed a short.

I can't determine the exact relationship between the input and output wave. When I trigger by one of the waves, the other is flowing from left to right on the screen.

406,406,632,Spokes keep breaking - bad hub or bad build?,"Background information

A bit of background information (I'll try keep it brief): Last year I bought an old but unused bike, 5 speeds with internal gearing.

Apparently the shop bought a lot of bikes somewhere in the 90's (not sure), but never got around to selling them. When I bought it, it was wrapped in plastic, had been stored in the shop's stock house for about 20 years and free of corrosion.

I'm about 95 kilos, thread quite hard but rides exclusive to paved bike paths. The original, 20(?) year-old wheel lasted me a year with no problems. The front wheel is still fine and true. 

Spokes breaking - and getting replaced

After a little under a year, I suddenly noticed that a few spokes had broken. On closer inspection, quite a few were too loose. Should have noticed sooner but didn't.

I took it to a shop, where they advised me to have the wheel rebuilt which I paid them to do. The gearing being internal, the new rims and spokes were built on the existing hub.

After just two weeks, the back wheel suddenly began to feel wobbly on my way to work. As careful as I could, I drove the bike back to the shop. Almost all spokes were terribly loose.

They retensioned the wheel free of charge (of course) and sent me on my way. The following weeks, I periodically checked that all spokes were still tensioned.

2,5 months later, I noticed three of the spokes were broken close to the hub. Went back to the shop and had the spokes replaced (free or charge). 1 month later I noticed 2 broken spokes and had those replaced as well. They seemed less eager to keep fixing the wheel free of charge, and when I asked why the spokes kept breaking, the guy muttered something about the hub holes maybe had burrs due to wear.

Now, a few weeks later, I find another spoke broken.

My gut tells me this all stems from a bad build, that quickly lost tension and thus damaged the spokes. I find the explanation about a worn hub a bit far fetched, but I don't have the knowledge to dismiss the theory.

Questions

Is there any way this is not the shop's fault? - A bad build? Cheap spokes? Improperly tensioned?

Given the wheel's history, is there any point in keep replacing spokes, a couple at a time, or should I get the wheel rebuilt (preferably at the shop's expense)?

Could the hub in any way be to blame for this?

Thank you!

Update Oct 24th

I've been trying to get in touch with the manager of the shop throughout the week. Failed again to reach him this morning, so I figured I'd have a chat about my problem with one of the guys on the floor.

Tried to get him to provide at least a theory of why my spokes keep breaking, but not much came out of it really. He mentioned that he've seen, on rare occasaions, that a worn hub could cut the spokes (could be the same guy as I spoke to last time).

I'll check the hubs as soon as possible, as @Daniel R Hicks suggested. Due to plumbing work in our appartment, I haven't been home or able to check my bike all week.

If I don't see any indicatations that the spokes were put in the wrong way, I'm going to follow the advice most of you have, and take my bike to another shop for advice and repair.

Thanks so far! - I'll update you after I've payed the other shop a visit.

Update Nov 3rd

Took the bike to the other shop, told them the story. Let them decide to replace the broken spoke or them all.

They decided to replace just the broken spoke with a DT spoke (what ever that means). They also trued the wheel, which had gotten a slight ""eggy"" shape.

My fingers are crossed that this wheel will last now.

Once again, thank you all for your input!

Anecdotal Update

In case anyone follows... Since the last repair at the other shop, the wheel kept being in good shape. Finally, my spokes stayed tensioned, wheels stiff and true - the long struggle was finally over. Alas, the joy didn't even last a month...

Going home from a company party, I returned to my bike I parked at the train station, only to find out that some punk kids had apparently tossed it to the ground, and jumped both wheels badly out of shape. Front wheel had to be replaced and back wheel was in desperate need for a trueing. sigh

Sorry for the melodrama, just thought I'd update you the faith of my bike ;-).
",abstrask,https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/users/3123,"""Burrs on the hub"" sounds bogus to me.  Could be the case with a new hub, but burrs would be worn away with use.

It seems most likely that the hub was reassembled by ""unskilled labor"" (the new/careless guy in the shop) and he didn't notice that the hub holes are directional -- there is a countersink on one side of the hole and not the other -- or didn't understand how you put spokes in such a hub.

When the holes are directional, you put the head of the spoke on the non-countersunk side, so that the curve of the spoke mates with the smooth countersink.  Placing spokes the opposite way will result in the curve of the spoke being against the sharp corner of the hole (and a broken spoke).

To check this, look at any hole where a spoke is broken.  If the two sides the hole are different, the side with the smooth rounded countersunk shape should be matched with the bend in the spoke, and the head should be on the other side.

Another possibility is that machine spokes were used.  These spokes have a longer distance between the head and the bend, to simplify things for lacing machines.  But these are bad for hand lacing, as there is too much ""lever arm"" unsupported by the spoke hole, and the heads will tend to pop off.  If such spokes are used one must use small spacer washers on the head side to pull the bend tightly to the curve of the spoke hole.

Or, of course, they could be lousy spokes.

(If they were breaking at the rim end this would be due to the way the rim is drilled and possible missassembly placing left-facing drilled holes with a right-facing spoke, or simply spokes that aren't strong enough to stand up to the stress of being slightly bent at the nipple.)

3095,3095,4930,How does multitasking work,"I am completely clueless about the inner workings of an operating system, but I can more or less guess the approximate behaviour of many functions. One thing that I am not able to figure out, though, is multitasking.

In theory, the operating system manages time, according the CPU for small intervals to the various programs running. But it is not clear how this really works.

Say the operating system wants to start my program. The machine code is loaded somewhere in RAM, starting at a certain address. I guess then a jump should be performed to that address, allowing my code to execute. But in this way, the OS cannot regain control until I jump back.

Basically, I can imagine just two ways of making this work, but neither seems really suitable:


The operating system could read the machine instructions I want to perform and emulate them instead of executing them directly. I am intentionally vague, since I do not know how this would work, but it seems like it would slow down the program considerably.
Alternatively, the operating system could wait until I make a system call. In that moment it regains control and can check how long I have been running and do its timesharing stuff. This may work, but it seems unreliable, as I could make a long calculation which does not involve system calls and hang everything for a while.


So, it seems neither mechanism would work very well. How is multitasking actually performed?

2034,2034,3241,Interpolated FIR filter,"I am confused about this Q&amp;A :  Interpolation by factor of 2

If my input signal 
$$
x[n]= x0,x1,x2,x3
$$
then according to the threads explaination my $v[n]$ will be 

$$
v[n]=x0,0,x1,0,x2,0,x3,0
$$

$x[n] \rightarrow$ zeropad $\rightarrow v[n]$

$v[n]\rightarrow$ LPF $\rightarrow y[m]$

My $y[m]$ is the output of LPF which removes aliases. So basically LPF transfer function is given as 

$$
y[m] = v[n]*h[n]
$$

i,e. $y[m]=\displaystyle\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}h(m-n)v(n)$

So here $h[m]$ is my filter coefficients and  $v[n]$ is my zero padded input signal...
so, if I multiply zero with my filter coefficients, then my output will also be zero...

If I send 10 input samples, after zero padding I will get 20 samples, out of which 10 will be zero....

So what is the use of getting zero as my output? Correct me if am wrong (I know I am wrong, but please give me some idea how zero padding &amp; LPF is helping in this regard).

For FIR filter: $y(n)=h(0)x(n)+h(1)x(n−1)+....+h(N−1)x(n−N+1)$,
 where $x(n)$ is the input signal,
 $y(n)$ is the output signal, 
$h(n)$ is the impulse response, 
and $N$ is the filter length. 

For simplicity, I am taking order $N=4$,and some random numbers

    (time) n --&gt; [ 0  1  2  3] 
         x[n]--&gt; [ 2  4  6  8] 
         h[n]--&gt; [.1 .2 .3 .4] 


what is $y[2.5]$??? 

                  n--&gt;[0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5]  
               v[n]--&gt;[2  0  4  0  6  0  8  0 ] (after zero padding)


Lets calculate for $y[2.5]=h(0)x(2.5)+h(1)x(1.5)+h(2)x(0.5)+h(3)x(-0.5)$ 

so here $x(2.5)=x(1.5)=x(0.5)=0$

1314,1314,2077,"What do you call a customer's customer in a specification document, use case, or scenario?","My team and I develop software that our customers will use to interact with their customers.  Additionally, we also eat our own dogfood and use the software ourselves to interact with our customers.

Therefore, it can sometimes be difficult to explain use cases and scenarios, as our employees can be operators, our customers can be operators, and our customers' customers can be visitors.

However, our customers can also be visitors interacting with our operator employees, our customers' customers can be visitors interacting with our customer or our employee.

Here is a model where:

A is an employee
B is a customer
C is our customers' customer

X  interacts with  Y
Operator --&gt; Visitor
      A  --&gt;  B
      A  --&gt;  C
      B  --&gt;  C


Because sometimes our customers can play different roles, it's sometimes necessary to refer to the specific role, Operator or Visitor, instead of Employee and Customer.

It's also a mouthful to say ""customer's customer"" all the time.

I was wondering how other development shops handle these semantic details when writing their use cases and scenarios.  


Are there any one-word, generic terms that can apply to any product that involves a third-level actor?
Other than using the specific roles, Operator and Visitor, what words could be used to identify a customer of a customer?  


The word would need to be short enough as to be adopted within an organization.  If longer than a couple syllables, it's shortened form must still differentiate it from the other actors.

782,782,1244,What are the benefits of owning a physical book?,"I have seen this question about updates of the D&amp;D 4th Edition books, and it got me thinking.
Since I got my Kindle I have not read a single paper novel; they have fewer drawbacks compared to digital copies than rpg rulebooks.


Dead-tree types have some benefits like looking good on a bookshelf, but any ebook reader weighs less with 100 novels than the usual hard-cover book. 
If you want to look for the damage of Ares Alpha, even with a half-decent tablet it takes less than 2 seconds.  
Digital copies do not get worn, they never get unwanted earmarks, but you can bookmark them.
Rulebooks do get updates, and unless you are willing to take a pen to your book, your hard copies will never contain them. The pdfs can be edited and resent to the buyers. 
Even better is the WotC approach with the DDI, you can look up any monster or item or (almost any) rule, in the most recent form, for 3 years at the cost of seven books. 


I think this is the way to go, even considering the horribly slow character builder. Although I must admit good illustration can help build the athmosphere.

So what am I missing? Why are people buying rpg rulebooks in paper format? Why are books even published, I do not need to know if feats are supposed to be on the right page and skills on the left, I just want a list of them, filterable any way I want. 

Is this just a necessary part of earning money? I understand that pdfs are copied illegally, but the Compendium is not.

Consider two stocks A and B. A offers a dividend of $1 per year. B offers a dividend of $2 per year. Let's remove all complications aside and assume that this trend continues. If you were to buy each of these stocks you will get the following amounts over its life (assumed infinity for simplicity):


  cash flows from A = $1/(0.04) = $25, assuming risk free is 4% per annum
  
  cash flows from B = $2/(0.04) = $50, assuming risk free is 4% per annum


The price you buy them at is an important factor to consider because let's say if A was trading for $10 and B for $60, then A would look like a profitable nvestment while B won't. Of course, this is a very simplistic view. Dividend rates are not constant and many companies pose a significant risk of going bust but this should help illustrate the general idea behind the D/P ratio.

P.S.:- The formula I have used is one for computing the NPV of a perpetuity.

",Michael Kimin Choo,https://stackoverflow.com/users/2116655,"A hash can't have multiple keys. A hash only has a single level of keys, but the values of those keys can point to other hashes.

You have a hash called %hash that is keyed by $loginId. The values in this hash point to other hashes (each value is a completely separate hash) that are all keyed by $month. It's an important point to understand.

I find that I can help myself remember this by using the -&gt; operator. This reminds me I'm talking about references and not merely other keys.

For example, instead of writing this:

$hash{$loginId}{$month} = $hash{$loginId}{$month} + $time1;


I would have write this:

$hash{$loginId}-&gt;{$month} = $hash{$loginId}-&gt;{$month} + $time1;


It's not much, but it's a good reminder that $month are keys to a hash reference and I need to dereference that hash before I can see its values. 

Let's take a simple loop that prints out %hash:

for my $loginId ( sort keys %hash ) {
    print qq(\$hash{$loginId} = ""$hash{$loginId}""\n"";
}


This will print out something like this:

$hash{bob} = ""HASH(0x7f8e3b804ee8)""
$hash{david} = ""HASH(0x...)""
$hash{sue} = ""HASH(0x...)""


The HASH{0x...) are addresses to a hash reference. I need to dereference that hash to get the values:

for my $loginId ( sort keys %hash ) {
    my %months = %{ $hash{$loginId) };  # Dereferencing the hash;
}


Now, that I've dereferenced the hash, I can print out the months for each user:

for my $loginId ( sort keys %hash ) {
    my %months = %{ $hash{$loginId) };
    for my $month ( sort keys %months ) {
        print qq(\$hash{$loginId}-&gt;{$month} = ) . $hash{$loginId}-&gt;{$month} . ""\n"";
    }
}


By the way, there's no reason I couldn't combine the referencing with the inner for loop:

for my $loginId ( sort keys %hash ) {
    for my $month ( sort keys %{ $hash{$loginId) } ) {
        print qq(\$hash{$loginId}-&gt;{$month} = ) . $hash{$loginId}-&gt;{$month} . ""\n"";
    }
}

1825,1825,2894,Moving a WP Multisite to a subdirectory,"Firstly, I've read a number of posts on this process. However, for various reasons, the process remains difficult to implement or troubleshoot for lack of even abstracted examples, or maybe too abstracted. And there's a few ""can not do"" posts, nearly always followed up by ""with 3.5, you now can"" caveats, so whether one can remains ambiguous, though no doubt non-trivial.

Summary:

How to move a wordpress multisite (WPMS) from root.com to root/blogs?

For this example, we're moving a WPMS from ""root.com"" to ""root.com/blogs""

I understand that I need to update the paths in the database and wp-config.php appropriately. It seems I may also have to update .htaccess? I'm also aware of the serialization issue with search/replace and mysql query updates.

I have a WPMS that I've updated to 3.5. I've found the following tables with domain and path info

Existing working configuration before move to subdirectory

1. wp_blogs

select blog_id, domain, path from wp_blogs;
+---------+-------------+--------+
| blog_id | domain      | path   |
+---------+-------------+--------+
|       1 | root.com    | /      |
|       2 | root.com    | /matt/ |
+---------+-------------+--------+


2. wp_site

select * in wp_site;
+----+-------------+------+
| id | domain      | path |
+----+-------------+------+
|  1 | root.com    | /    |
+----+-------------+------+


3. The blog_id corresponds to the wp_#_options tables which contain:

select option_name,option_value from wp_2_options 
where option_name = 'home' or option_name = 'siteurl';
+-------------+--------------------------+
| option_name | option_value             |
+-------------+--------------------------+
| home        | http://root.com/matt/    |
| siteurl     | http://root.com/matt/    |
+-------------+--------------------------+


4. In my wp-config.php I have the following WPMS-specific lines:

define('WP_ALLOW_MULTISITE', true);
define( 'MULTISITE', true );
define( 'SUBDOMAIN_INSTALL', false);
$base = '/';
define( 'DOMAIN_CURRENT_SITE', 'root.com' );
define( 'PATH_CURRENT_SITE', '/' );
define( 'SITE_ID_CURRENT_SITE', 1 );
define( 'BLOG_ID_CURRENT_SITE', 1 );


5. Lastly, in my .htaccess, I have:

RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /
RewriteRule ^index\.php$ - [L]

# uploaded files
RewriteRule ^([_0-9a-zA-Z-]+/)?files/(.+) wp-includes/ms-files.php?file=$2 [L]

# add a trailing slash to /wp-admin
RewriteRule ^([_0-9a-zA-Z-]+/)?wp-admin$ $1wp-admin/ [R=301,L]

RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} -f [OR]
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} -d
RewriteRule ^ - [L]
RewriteRule  ^[_0-9a-zA-Z-]+/(wp-(content|admin|includes).*) $1 [L]
RewriteRule  ^[_0-9a-zA-Z-]+/(.*\.php)$ $1 [L]
RewriteRule . index.php [L]


Updates required to move the site

It seems to me that in order to move my site to the /blogs , I would:

1. Update wp_blogs to

mysql&gt; update wp_blogs set domain=concat(domain, '/blogs'), path=concat(path, 'blogs/');
select blog_id, domain, path from wp_blogs where blog_id &lt; 3;
+---------+-------------+--------------+
| blog_id | domain      | path         |
+---------+-------------+--------------+
|       1 | root.com    | /blogs/      |
|       2 | root.com    | /blogs/matt/ |
+---------+-------------+--------------+


2. Update wp_site to

update wp_site set domain=concat(domain, '/blogs'), path=concat(path, 'blogs/');
select * from  wp_site;
+----+-------------+------------+
| id | domain      | path       |
+----+-------------+------------+
|  1 | root.com    | /blogs/    |
+----+-------------+------------+


3. wp_#_options

+-------------+--------------------------------+
| option_name | option_value                   |
+-------------+--------------------------------+
| home        | http://root.com/blogs/matt/    |
| siteurl     | http://root.com/blogs/matt/    |
+-------------+--------------------------------+


4. wp_config.php

define('WP_ALLOW_MULTISITE', true);
define( 'MULTISITE', true );
define( 'SUBDOMAIN_INSTALL', false);
$base = '/blogs/';
define( 'DOMAIN_CURRENT_SITE', 'root.com' );
define( 'PATH_CURRENT_SITE', '/blogs/' );
define( 'SITE_ID_CURRENT_SITE', 1 );
define( 'BLOG_ID_CURRENT_SITE', 1 );


note: I'm not clear how this step is appropriately updated

5. .htaccess

I found vague ""update .htaccess appropriately"" instructions, but not specifics. Update RewriteBase? Which lines in .htaccess to I update when I move root.com to root.com/blogs?

Missing from the above process will be the paths founds in posts. My druthers are to use the search and replace tool for that, after I've made this more fundamental updates; or am I wrong?

Update bungeshea suggests that, yes, I point RewriteBase to the ""blogs"" subdirectory, i.e.,

RewriteBase /Blogs

2306,2306,3677,How do you decide when a paladin has fallen from grace in DnD 5e?,"There does not seem to be a clear-cut way to determine when a paladin's actions have become egregious enough to justify them breaking their oath. Do a lot of minor slights eventually add up and cause an oath to be broken? Do they get some sort of warning like losing their laying on of hands ability? 
",adclark09,https://rpg.stackexchange.com/users/22899,"You're right.  There is no clear cut way.  That's by design.  How this works varies a lot by playstyle:

Some groups have a solid understanding of ethics and jurisprudence and use some limited form of said understanding adjudicate alignment in D&amp;D.  Others use their full understanding of ethics, which cumulates for them into a D&amp;D compatible system, to perform that adjudication.  These groups are very similar except that the first group tends to have less issues adjudicating alignment in difficult situations where the latter group discovers holes in their beliefs about morality.  In both of these cases alignment is adjudicated according to the chosen moral/ethical system, and what constitutes oath-breaking will be adjudicated similarly according to the related principles of jurisprudence. As moral relativism becomes, unfortunately, increasingly popular, objective alignment becomes less and less so, especially amongst simulationist groups, and so these two methods of alignment adjudication are unlikely.

Some groups think alignment is stupid, meaningless, and entirely subjective.  These people are very vocal.  They likely also think that oathbreaking is similarly problematic.  Like alignment-based powers in previous editions, in these groups if you're going to use anything that's based off alignment or alignment-like systems (like the paladin class) you should first check with your DM to find out 1) if it's allowed and 2) what it means in the context of the campaign.  One common solution in the past in these kinds of groups has been just to waive the alignment restriction entirely, for the Paladin class.

Some groups think that obviously alignment is objective, because it's in the rules, but they just don't understand it yet.  These groups will post difficult alignment questions as they come up on online fora.  The outcome of alignment based actions in such groups will be fickle and likely a point of tension.

Some groups try and adjudicate this according to the original inspiration for the alignment system, which is a set of novels written by Michael Moorcock.  This is hard because the novels are novel-y and don't explain exactly what Law and Chaos are in cut and dry terms.  Such groups would probably not adjudicate the oath the same way they do alignment, because Jurisprudence is fundamentally a principle of Balance, not Law, in that system, and there's almost nothing to go on for how something like the 5e paladin oath should be dealt with.

In any case, if you are not the DM, ask your DM how the metaphysics of ethics and jurisprudence are related in their game.  If they are related, seek to focus more on the adjudication of ethics than jurisprudence as the ethical component is probably dominant in most GM adjudications.  If they are not related, ask about Jurisprudence in general, and the adjudication of your class abilities in particular, if necessary, focusing on what an Oath means, what it means to break it, and how reparations might be made if the oath is indeed broken.

If you are the DM, I strongly recommend you consciously decide what philosophical system of justice you will use in your campaign, as all of the other options amount to unconsciously using some system and putting some introspective thought into this choice before you start running the game is likely to make these kinds of decisions much easier and much faster during the game sessions, since you will spend much less time figuring out how to approach each specific case.

If you want a place to start looking at different approaches to the philosophy of oaths, I recommend this paper.

Will a lot of slight contempt eventually lead to the breaking of vows? Do they get some kind of warning, such as losing the ability to start?","You're right.  There is no clear cut way.  That's by design.  How this works varies a lot by playstyle:

Some groups have a solid understanding of ethics and jurisprudence and use some limited form of said understanding adjudicate alignment in D&amp;D.  Others use their full understanding of ethics, which cumulates for them into a D&amp;D compatible system, to perform that adjudication.  These groups are very similar except that the first group tends to have less issues adjudicating alignment in difficult situations where the latter group discovers holes in their beliefs about morality.  In both of these cases alignment is adjudicated according to the chosen moral/ethical system, and what constitutes oath-breaking will be adjudicated similarly according to the related principles of jurisprudence. As moral relativism becomes, unfortunately, increasingly popular, objective alignment becomes less and less so, especially amongst simulationist groups, and so these two methods of alignment adjudication are unlikely.

Some groups think alignment is stupid, meaningless, and entirely subjective.  These people are very vocal.  They likely also think that oathbreaking is similarly problematic.  Like alignment-based powers in previous editions, in these groups if you're going to use anything that's based off alignment or alignment-like systems (like the paladin class) you should first check with your DM to find out 1) if it's allowed and 2) what it means in the context of the campaign.  One common solution in the past in these kinds of groups has been just to waive the alignment restriction entirely, for the Paladin class.

Some groups think that obviously alignment is objective, because it's in the rules, but they just don't understand it yet.  These groups will post difficult alignment questions as they come up on online fora.  The outcome of alignment based actions in such groups will be fickle and likely a point of tension.

Some groups try and adjudicate this according to the original inspiration for the alignment system, which is a set of novels written by Michael Moorcock.  This is hard because the novels are novel-y and don't explain exactly what Law and Chaos are in cut and dry terms.  Such groups would probably not adjudicate the oath the same way they do alignment, because Jurisprudence is fundamentally a principle of Balance, not Law, in that system, and there's almost nothing to go on for how something like the 5e paladin oath should be dealt with.

In any case, if you are not the DM, ask your DM how the metaphysics of ethics and jurisprudence are related in their game.

DATA    2012-06-04  23:49:16    1338853756  0   -0.0239447


Basically the timestamp is divided into 4 columns - DATE, TIME, SECONDS and NANOSECONDS.
I'd like to read the file as a pandas DataFrame with DATE, TIME and NANOSECONDS as datetime objects, which are used as index:

import datetime as dt
import pandas as pd

parse = lambda x: dt.datetime.strptime(x, '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %f')

df = pd.read_csv('data.txt', sep='\t', parse_dates=[['DATE', 'TIME', 'NANOSECONDS']], index_col=0, date_parser=parse)


But this fails, because nanoseconds values have 9 digits instead of 6 as required by the %f format. The above code works if I manually remove the 3 extra zeroes from the values in NANOSECONDS column.
Could you please show me, how I can read-in the sample file as a pandas DataFrame object using DATE, TIME and NANOSECONDS columns as index?

[UPDATE] Using %f000 as suggested by behzad.nouri works if NANOSECONDS column doesn't contain 0 values. So, apparently this is what's causing the problem now.

5499,5499,8724,Do cold blooded animals generate any heat?,"In explaining energy and work to an 8 year-old I said that all conversion of energy generates heat as a by-product.  For example, cars generate heat in their engines and running generates heat in our bodies.  Then the 8 year-old said, except for cold-blooded animals.

So my question is, do cold-blooded animals generate any heat in their conversion of stored energy (food, fat, etc) into motion?  If they generate heat, why are they cold-blooded?

4228,4228,6742,Tuples in LaTeX,"I am learning to use TikZ to draw things in LaTeX. One of the things that TikZ seems to use everywhere for specifying coordinates is a tuple.  For example,

\begin{tikzpicture}
  \node[isosceles triangle, isosceles triangle apex angle=70,
     draw=black,fill=white, inner sep=0pt,anchor=lower 
     side,rotate=90,draw=black,
     fill=white, minimum height=2 cm] (a) at (0,0) {};
\end{tikzpicture}


Creates a small isosceles triangle.  Note the use of (0,0).  Let's encapsulate making a triangle as above with the following macro.

\newcommand\Tri[3]{ 
  \node[isosceles triangle, isosceles triangle apex angle=70,
     draw=black,fill=white, inner sep=0pt,anchor=lower 
     side,rotate=90,draw=black,
     fill=white, minimum height={#2} cm] (#1) at #3 {};}


Suppose I wanted to define a function that takes in a size and starting coordinate, and draws a ""triangle"" of triangles such as

\begin{tikzpicture}
  \Tri{a}{1}{(-1,0)}
  \Tri{b}{1}{(1,0)}
  \Tri{c}{1}{(0,1.41)}
\end{tikzpicture}


The simple way to do this is to make a macro \TriTri, such that \TriTri{a}{n}{x}{y} creates a triangle of triangles, with bottom triangle anchored at (x,y).

\newcommand\TriTri[4]{ 
  \Tri{#1}{#2}{(#3,#4)}
  \Tri{#1}{#2}{(#3+2*#2,#4)}
  \Tri{#1}{#2}{(#3+#2,{sqrt(2*#2*#2)})}} %% note #3+#2 = (x1 + x2)/2 
                                         %% the sqrt bit is sqrt(size^2 + size^2)
}


I have gotten this to work! But what I would like to do is instead of having x and y input separately, I would like to have them input as a coordinate pair. I would like to reference the coordinates as \first,\second.  So that \first(x,y) = x. The desired effect is that

$$\first(1,2)$$


would be the same as

1878,1878,2981,Rate-limiting in transition state theory,"Suppose an initial state $A$ can transition to either state $C$ or state $D$. Suppose further that both of these two processes are rate-limited by a transition to the same intermediate state $B$, as follows:



Note that $\Delta G_{AB}&gt; \Delta G_{BC}&gt;\Delta G_{BD}$.

According to transition state theory, rates are determined by the rate-limiting step. So the rate of each process will be the same,

\begin{align}
r_{A\to C}&amp;=r_{A\to B} \\
r_{A\to D}&amp;=r_{A\to B}
\end{align}

from which it follows that the number of transitions made during some large $\Delta t$ will also be the same,

\begin{align}
N_{A\to C}&amp;=r_{A\to B}\Delta t \\
N_{A\to D}&amp;=r_{A\to B}\Delta t

However, if we were to consider the two pathways collectively then we would predict more transitions to be made to state $D$ than $B$ since $\Delta G_{BD}&lt;\Delta G_{BC}$.

You can use TST to estimate rate constants.
$$k = \frac{\mathcal{k}_\mathrm{B} T}{\mathrm{h}} \exp\left\{ −\frac{\Delta^\ddagger{}G^\circ}{\mathcal{R} T}\right\}$$

Since all components have to be in equilibrium, you can predict a ratio between them via Boltzmann statistics, hence:

The preceding equilibrium does not need to be considered to determine the ratio of the products. However, it is important to note, that there are many assumptions necessary for TST to work. For example, at higher temperatures, anharmonic corrections have to be considered. More crucial is the assumption, that the transition can be described as a translatory movement, i.e. it is treated with classical mechanics. 

For a system with a preceding equilibrium, it is well possible, that the TST approximation breaks down completely.

291,291,468,Chaining deferreds,"I have a lot of functions that currently look like this:

This function takes a URL and loads the text within a promise. The text is then passed to the LoadFromText function which returns another promise. If this succeeds, the outer deferred is resolved. If the URL cannot be loaded, or the LoadFromText function fails then the outer deferred is rejected.

Is there a way that I can chain the result of the resolve / reject and end up with something like this:

function LoadFromURL(url) 
{
    return $.get(url).then(function(text)
    {
        return LoadFromText(text);

    function(err)

I've seen some implementations of promises that allow this - returning a promise within 'then', means that the eventual result of the promise is used.

",Barguast,https://stackoverflow.com/users/283445,"LoadFromURL will simplify as follows:

function LoadFromURL(url) {
    return $.get(url).then(function(text) {
        return LoadFromText(text);
    });
}


There may be issues you haven't considered ...

Like your original version, the process will tend to recurse indefinitely until the server returns an HTTP error. You would have a slight challenge in writing the server resource appropriately, especially if, as is probable, you need to access the finally delivered text. 

With a little more thought, you could deliver all text in such a way that ""continue"" or ""complete"" is indicated in the text itself, or in an HTTP response code. For example, you could use response code 202 (""Accepted"") to indicate that the process is incomplete. 

I think this will work (with jQuery 1.5+) :

function LoadFromURL(url) {
    return $.get(url).then(function(text, textStatus, jqXHR) {
        if(jqXHR.status === 202) {//continue
            return LoadFromText(text);
        }
        else {//complete
            return text;
        }
    });
}


You just need to arrange for the server to return 202 for ""continue"" or 200 for ""complete"".

Thus, LoadFromURL() could be called as follows :

LoadFromURL('my/resource').then(function(text) {
    console.log(""After a series of $.get requests, the finally delivered text was:\n"" + text);
});

222,222,354,Prospects with a Computational Social Science degree,"During college, I decided to use my free electives to pursue a second major I had an interest in (Sociology) besides my main focus on computer science. 

I am contemplating applying to some phD programs that intersect both of these fields. However, I know these are new programs.

I have e-mailed a few departments but I get the vibe that they are more focused in getting people to apply to these new programs rather than necessarily being honest about prospects. 

So my question is essentially, are there tenure track professorships that are interested in applicants with these kinds of backgrounds? And if so is it only a very small group of institutions?

Example of one of the programs I am referring to: Ph.D Program in Computational Social Sciences
",Bob,https://academia.stackexchange.com/users/8410,"I'm in the CSS department at George Mason University, just starting my dissertation.  Though I'm not primarily aimed at tenure-track academic jobs after graduating, I have some insights regarding the questions you have asked.

First, you should know that CSS at GMU (and most other places similar to it) are not solely focused on placing their graduates into academic jobs.  There's a wide diversity of career paths, both prior to entering and after graduating.  To me, that creates a looseness and openness among the students.  This is in contrast to discipline-focused departments where everyone is expected to prepare for and compete for top academic jobs.  In those situations, there seems to be a strong emphasis on things other than just learning and doing good research (competition, prizes/awards, getting into the 'in crowd', elitism, etc.)

Second, CSS would be a poor fit for many academic jobs (research or teaching) that really want depth and credentials in a single discipline -- Economics, Sociology, Business, or Computer Science.

Finally, there is significant growth in the number of departments and jobs (internationally and in the US) that specifically call for Computational Social Science or similar interdisciplinary degree.  This is driven in part by funding agencies who have become very enthusiastic for CSS and similar types of programs and projects.  It's also driven by market demand -- especially for social network analysis, Big Data in social science, and programmatic research (e.g. public health, international development, conflict studies, cyber security). While the number of these jobs may not be large in absolute terms,  CSS graduates could be extremely well-qualified to fill them, compared to single-discipline graduates.

258,258,419,applying convolution theorem swaps quadrants,"For educational purposes I implemented the DFT and inverse DFT for images using OpenCV. Applying the DFT to an image and taking the inverse DFT of the spectrum yields the original image, so this works. I do not rearrange the spectral image from $ [0,N) $ to $ [-N/2, N/2) $.

Now, using the convolution theorem I want to filter an image. I use a 3x3 averaging kernel and pad it with zeroes to the same size as the input image. I then take the DFT of it, and do a piecewise multiplication of the image spectrum and the kernel spectrum. 

The inverse DFT of the resulting spectrum yields an interesting result: The image is filtered (smoothed) correctly, however the quadrants are swapped. Interestingly, if I filter it twice (or any even number), the quadrants are properly arranged. This works for both

$$ \mathcal{F}^{-1}\{ (\mathcal{F}\{I\}\mathcal{F}\{H\})\mathcal{F}\{H\} \} = $$
$$ \mathcal{F}^{-1}\{ \mathcal{F}\{I\}(\mathcal{F}\{H\}\mathcal{F}\{H\}) \} $$

with the image $ I $ and kernel $ H $. This makes sense to me since convolution is associative.

What is the cause of the swapped quadrants?

4909,4909,7813,"Relationship field - {count} of type, and {total_results} of type","I have a relationship field which contains a number of different pieces of content.

\end{pset}

\end{document}


In the label I add a command \thispitem (with \protect so enumitem doesn't interpret it when setting up the environment).

Then \pitem examines the presence of an optional argument and acts consequently: if none is specified, it just prints a period, otherwise a space, the parenthesized argument and the period.

1531,1531,2405,Equivalent Key Signatures,"I've noticed that a variety of pieces in the classical repetoire (certainly at least the piano repetoire), label what seems to be effectively the same key signature differently. That is, I am not aware of any differences in terms of key between a piece in ""G Sharp major"" and ""A flat major"" (or their equivalent minors). Is there any reason that sometimes a sharped key signature is used while at other times the equivalent flatted key signature is used?

As a related point, I have undoubtedly noticed the preference of certain ""equivalent"" key signatures over others. For example, one encounters ""E flat"" significantly more than ""D sharp"" and likewise ""C sharp"" significantly more than ""D flat"". Is there any particular reason for this, or is it simply a convention that has been handed down to use through musical history?

1718,1718,2720,Is research a viable business model?,"I have had the suspicion that it may be for a while and apparently not all is a product of my mind. Let me quote from an answer:


  In my experience, in UK and other European countries, the research
  funding comes from successful proposals to the relevant funding
  bodies. There are research centres that were established and keep
  going only because the staff there constantly submits project
  proposals (somebody told me that the success rate is 1 out of 5 or
  maybe even lower).


There are two questions here.


Can a company feasibly focus on obtaining funds in publicly funded research (as a business model) successfully enough to ""survive""?
Can such a company be started (nearly) from scratch?


In short, the company would be exactly like a research institute (or institution) except that it would be private.

Reasons why question 1 may not be feasible:


I don't see any company doing this kind of thing, i.e. there may be some, but there are not many, which means that it may be hard. It's a bad sign.
Public funds seem to be assigned to public entities, while companies can benefit from the collaboration and synergy, but they are expected to get their funding from their work as companies (searching for customers, etc.) In this case the customers would be the partners in the projects and the society itself, but again, this seems to be an ""innovative"" (maybe naïve, or even plain stupid) idea.
Research is a means for something, not an end on itself, that's why the business model should be on something else (point two) and that's why such a company would raise eyebrows on the mere idea of its existence. It may even be against some kind of tacit rule or even written laws.


Reasons why question 2 may not be feasible:


No previous history of success of the company, or products or anything means zero (or negative) trustworthiness and no projects assigned to the company.
No partners would like to associate with the company in a project for the reasons in point 1.
The most similar case I can think of are spin-off companies that are created from successful research labs, not from scratch.
OMG so much communism! Go to kickstarter you hippie!


As an example, a possible scenario that could be close to this: Someone writes a paper about a software system that does something not very novel in the state of the art but in a way that is very different from an architectural point of view, leading to good results in practical terms. In short: in theory nothing is new, in practice what was just a dream is now a reality. What is done remains the same in theory, but how it is done is completely different in practice (and now it works). Unfortunately only a proof of concept (PoC) can reasonably be implemented.

Would it be feasible to request funds to continue the development of this PoC (still very far from a commercial product) as a start-up or that simply doesn't make sense?

3713,3713,5922,Moving a WP Multisite to a subdirectory,"Firstly, I've read a number of posts on this process. However, for various reasons, the process remains difficult to implement or troubleshoot for lack of even abstracted examples, or maybe too abstracted. And there's a few ""can not do"" posts, nearly always followed up by ""with 3.5, you now can"" caveats, so whether one can remains ambiguous, though no doubt non-trivial.

Summary:

How to move a wordpress multisite (WPMS) from root.com to root/blogs?

For this example, we're moving a WPMS from ""root.com"" to ""root.com/blogs""

I understand that I need to update the paths in the database and wp-config.php appropriately. It seems I may also have to update .htaccess? I'm also aware of the serialization issue with search/replace and mysql query updates.

I have a WPMS that I've updated to 3.5. I've found the following tables with domain and path info

Existing working configuration before move to subdirectory

1. wp_blogs

select blog_id, domain, path from wp_blogs;
+---------+-------------+--------+
| blog_id | domain      | path   |
+---------+-------------+--------+
|       1 | root.com    | /      |
|       2 | root.com    | /matt/ |
+---------+-------------+--------+


2. wp_site

select * in wp_site;
+----+-------------+------+
| id | domain      | path |
+----+-------------+------+
|  1 | root.com    | /    |
+----+-------------+------+


3. The blog_id corresponds to the wp_#_options tables which contain:

select option_name,option_value from wp_2_options 
where option_name = 'home' or option_name = 'siteurl';
+-------------+--------------------------+
| option_name | option_value             |
+-------------+--------------------------+
| home        | http://root.com/matt/    |
| siteurl     | http://root.com/matt/    |
+-------------+--------------------------+


4. In my wp-config.php I have the following WPMS-specific lines:

define('WP_ALLOW_MULTISITE', true);
define( 'MULTISITE', true );
define( 'SUBDOMAIN_INSTALL', false);
$base = '/';
define( 'DOMAIN_CURRENT_SITE', 'root.com' );
define( 'PATH_CURRENT_SITE', '/' );
define( 'SITE_ID_CURRENT_SITE', 1 );
define( 'BLOG_ID_CURRENT_SITE', 1 );


5. Lastly, in my .htaccess, I have:

RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /
RewriteRule ^index\.php$ - [L]

# uploaded files
RewriteRule ^([_0-9a-zA-Z-]+/)?files/(.+) wp-includes/ms-files.php?file=$2 [L]

# add a trailing slash to /wp-admin
RewriteRule ^([_0-9a-zA-Z-]+/)?wp-admin$ $1wp-admin/ [R=301,L]

RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} -f [OR]
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} -d
RewriteRule ^ - [L]
RewriteRule  ^[_0-9a-zA-Z-]+/(wp-(content|admin|includes).*) $1 [L]
RewriteRule  ^[_0-9a-zA-Z-]+/(.*\.php)$ $1 [L]
RewriteRule . index.php [L]


Updates required to move the site

It seems to me that in order to move my site to the /blogs , I would:

1. Update wp_blogs to

mysql&gt; update wp_blogs set domain=concat(domain, '/blogs'), path=concat(path, 'blogs/');
select blog_id, domain, path from wp_blogs where blog_id &lt; 3;
+---------+-------------+--------------+
| blog_id | domain      | path         |
+---------+-------------+--------------+
|       1 | root.com    | /blogs/      |
|       2 | root.com    | /blogs/matt/ |
+---------+-------------+--------------+


2. Update wp_site to

update wp_site set domain=concat(domain, '/blogs'), path=concat(path, 'blogs/');
select * from  wp_site;
+----+-------------+------------+
| id | domain      | path       |
+----+-------------+------------+
|  1 | root.com    | /blogs/    |
+----+-------------+------------+


3. wp_#_options

+-------------+--------------------------------+
| option_name | option_value                   |
+-------------+--------------------------------+
| home        | http://root.com/blogs/matt/    |
| siteurl     | http://root.com/blogs/matt/    |
+-------------+--------------------------------+


4. wp_config.php

define('WP_ALLOW_MULTISITE', true);
define( 'MULTISITE', true );
define( 'SUBDOMAIN_INSTALL', false);
$base = '/blogs/';
define( 'DOMAIN_CURRENT_SITE', 'root.com' );
define( 'PATH_CURRENT_SITE', '/blogs/' );
define( 'SITE_ID_CURRENT_SITE', 1 );
define( 'BLOG_ID_CURRENT_SITE', 1 );


note: I'm not clear how this step is appropriately updated

5. .htaccess

I found vague ""update .htaccess appropriately"" instructions, but not specifics. Update RewriteBase? Which lines in .htaccess to I update when I move root.com to root.com/blogs?

Missing from the above process will be the paths founds in posts. My druthers are to use the search and replace tool for that, after I've made this more fundamental updates; or am I wrong?

Update bungeshea suggests that, yes, I point RewriteBase to the ""blogs"" subdirectory, i.e.,

RewriteBase /Blogs

2076,2076,3307,How to easily determine the results distribution for multiple dice?,"I want to calculate the probability distribution for the total of a combination of dice. 

I remember that the probability of is the number of combinations that total that number over the total number of combinations (assuming the dice have a uniform distribution). 

What are the formulas for


The number of combinations total
The number of combinations that total a certain number

",C. Ross,https://stats.stackexchange.com/users/1456,"There's a very neat way of computing the combinations or probabilities in a spreadsheet (such as excel) that computes the convolutions directly. 

I'll do it in terms of probabilities and illustrate it for six sided dice but you can do it for dice with any number of sides (including adding different ones).

(btw it's also easy in something like R or matlab that will do convolutions)

Start with a clean sheet, in a few columns, and move down a bunch of rows from the top (more than 6).


put the value 1 in a cell. That's the probabilities associated with 0 dice. put a 0 to its left; that's the value column - continue down from there with 1,2,3 down as far as you need.
move one column to the right and down a row from the '1'. enter the formula ""=sum("" then left-arrow up-arrow (to highlight the cell with 1 in it), hit "":"" (to start entering a range) and then up-arrow 5 times, followed by "")/6"" and press Enter - so you end up with a formula like =sum(c4:c9)/6  (where here C9 is the cell with the 1 in it).



Then copy the formula and paste it to the 5 cells below it. They should each contain 0.16667 (ish).



Don't type anything into the empty cells these formulas refer to!
move down 1 and to the right 1 from the top of that column of values and paste ...



... a total of another 11 values. These will be the probabilities for two dice. 



It doesn't matter if you paste a few too many, you'll just get zeroes.
repeat step 3 for the next column for three dice, and again for four, five, etc dice.



We see here that the probability of rolling $12$ on 4d6 is 0.096451  (if you multiply by $4^6$ you'll be able to write it as an exact fraction).


If you're adept with Excel - things like copying a formula from a cell and pasting into many cells in a column, you can generate all tables up to say 10d6 in about a minute or so (possibly faster if you've done it a few times).



If you want combination counts instead of probabilities, don't divide by 6.

If you want dice with different numbers of faces, you can sum $k$ (rather than 6) cells and then divide by $k$. You can mix dice across columns (e.g. do a column for d6 and one for d8 to get the probability function for d6+d8):

2683,2683,4277,Measuring Resistance of a Wire With an ADC,"I'm trying to design a circuit which can measure small resistances down to 0.1 Ohm and a max. of 10 Ohms. I won't be measuring actual resistors but rather large coil of wires, upto 500 m (as you can imagine, these wires are quite thick).

Here's the circuit I came up with:


The circuit works by maintaining a constant current through the device under test, R2. With a current of 100 mA, R2 would develop a voltage between 10 mV to 50 mV.

I think in an ideal world this would work but in practice I may have a hard time measuring 0.1 Ohms with this - mainly due to the ADC. Let's assume the ADC is 10-bit with VREF of 5V. This translates to 5mV per step. If R2 = 0.1 and Iout = 100 mA, then the voltage present at the ADC would be 50 mV - but I'm not sure how buried under noise this would be.

My question is, should I increase the gain to, say, 50. If the gain is 50, then the voltage present at the ADC would be 500 mV - but the max. measurable resistance would be 1 Ohms. To measure 10 Ohms, I would need to lower the current to 10 mA instead of 100 mA. A way to do that would be use an FET to switch out R1 and connect a 20 Ohm resistor at Iout.

I don't need the circuit to measure the resistance precisely - a tolerance of +/- 10% is fine.
",Saad,https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/3966,"First of all, this setup will not allow you to get a range of 0÷5V at the ADC input. Simply because the LM324 cannot swing up to its positive rail. It will also introduce potential offset voltages that will most certainly be able to ruin a 10 to 50mV measurement. 

I suggest getting an instrumentation amplifier or a selectable gain amplifier such as the MCP6G01. With a selectable gain from 1 to 100 you'll be able to maintain some accuracy within 2 orders of magnitude (e.g. from 0.1 to 10 Ohms).

4092,4092,6528,"Which is the older sense of the word ""linguist""?","I have been listening to some rants on YouTube against people learning a bunch of languages calling themselves ""linguists"".

I'm personally interested in both linguistics and languages as a hobby but I have no official training and certainly no qualifications in either.

My instinct was that the ranter was kind of right in his opinion that people who speak many languages are not linguists. But I was uncomfortable with his opinion that you had to have certain pieces of paper to be called a linguist, I think ""post doctorate"" from memory.

So I looked up ""linguist"" in some imperfect online dictionaries and was surprised to find both senses. Here's the defs from oxforddictionaries.com (chosen at random):


  
  A person skilled in foreign languages.
  A person who studies linguistics.
  


Now I don't have access to a better dictionary on historical principles from my current location.

I would like to know which of these senses is the original one?

My original opinion was the latter sense but on thinking about it I now expect it to be the former. I doubt the word would be a back-formation from ""linguistics"".

In the US, all products containing electronics that oscillate above 9 kHz must be certified. The law that governs this is FCC Part 15. The lawyers call this ""Title 47 CFR Part 15,"" meaning that it is the 15th subsection of the 47th section of the Code of Federal Regulations. In Europe, there is a similar regulation called CISPR 22. The requirements are almost the same, but slightly stricter about emissions at certain frequencies.

You can read 47 CFR 15 online. It's not as incomprehensible as you might expect. It seems overwhelming, but if you read the first few PDF's, you'll realize that most of it irrelevant for any single product.

Within 47 CFR 15, there are two classes of testing: Class A and Class B. Class A is an easier test to pass, intended for devices that are used in industrial settings. Class B is stricter, intended for devices that are targeted at consumers.

There is additional testing for ""intentional radiators,"" meaning radios, Wi-fi, Bluetooth and such. There may be an exception if your device is intended for use as a component in a larger system (like a microprocessor or memory card in a PC), but I'm not sure of the legal details there.

The major expense is renting the test chamber. This is what's called an ""anechoic chamber,"" instrumented with a pile of sensors for detecting electromagnetic radiation. To my knowledge, these cost around $1000/hour, and each testing session takes 2 or 3 hours. It's unlikely, but not impossible, that you will pass on the first try.

Here's a decent picture of a test chamber. The one I've been in was actually much larger, like a squash court. I think it was an Intertek facility in Menlo Park, CA.

Unless you're experienced with emissions testing, it is worth hiring an expert, which costs around $500/hour. They can tell you things like, ""Put a ferrite bead on that power cable, and that will reduce the emissions at this frequency."" The folks I've worked with arrive with a bunch of ferrite beads and inductors (and maybe caps?) of various sizes that you can use in the chamber to hack your device into compliance. 

(Perhaps it goes without saying, but I'm an engineer, not a lawyer. I have taken a few products through Part 15, but not in the last couple of years.)

to a sub-level.

Both. The menu is persistent on every page and a back button appears when needed.


Thanks for your help :)
",Leo,https://ux.stackexchange.com/users/25518,"I'd recommend iOS standards unless you really need to break from convention.  Standard iOS expectation is that you always have a back / up-level nav in the upper left corner. If you put 2 nav icons side-by-side in the upper left (Hamburger and Back Nav) that makes them both less usable and creates challenges - which is the one on the left most side?  Your #2 is the most common implementation.  Do users need to get back to the top most menu frequently enough to require having the hamburger nav on all screens? Then consider...

iOS standards also call for the use of the Tab Bar across the bottom - it is an option if you have a small (7) number of items in your nav (though it does persistently take up screen real-estate so isn't ideal unless the user needs to quickly access a few key screens).  

The big question for any use of Hamburger Menus is... what are you putting in there?  @Majo0od incorrectly states the reasons why hamburger menus are problematic.  Hamburger menus have been being maligned considerably lately and most of the critiques have zero to do with user experience.  List Menus (Hamburger Menus) work great when they provide a consistent list of items clearly delineated.  The majority of user testing with List Menus shows that users very easily understand what they are and often go there to find stuff if the thing they're looking for isn't obvious elsewhere on the screen.  This has led to some bad practice among designers who started tossing everything in there - this leads to a garbage pile of items which makes it difficult for users to find what they're looking for or to know what to expect on subsequent visits to that menu.  A similar List Menu metaphor used all over both iOS and Android is 3 dots on the right (doesn't look like a hamburger so it isn't as maligned but has identical problems when not used consistently).  This is usually used to show a contextual list based on where the user is rather than an omnipresent top left list menu. Going back to my point for this paragraph... what are you using it for?

Standard iOS expectation is that you always have a back / up-level nav in the upper left corner. If you put 2 nav icons side-by-side in the upper left (Hamburger and Back Nav) that makes them both less usable and creates challenges - which is the one on the left most side?  Your #2 is the most common implementation.  Do users need to get back to the top most menu frequently enough to require having the hamburger nav on all screens? Then consider...

iOS standards also call for the use of the Tab Bar across the bottom - it is an option if you have a small (7) number of items in your nav (though it does persistently take up screen real-estate so isn't ideal unless the user needs to quickly access a few key screens).  

The big question for any use of Hamburger Menus is... what are you putting in there?  @Majo0od incorrectly states the reasons why hamburger menus are problematic.  Hamburger menus have been being maligned considerably lately and most of the critiques have zero to do with user experience.  List Menus (Hamburger Menus) work great when they provide a consistent list of items clearly delineated.  The majority of user testing with List Menus shows that users very easily understand what they are and often go there to find stuff if the thing they're looking for isn't obvious elsewhere on the screen.  This has led to some bad practice among designers who started tossing everything in there - this leads to a garbage pile of items which makes it difficult for users to find what they're looking for or to know what to expect on subsequent visits to that menu.  A similar List Menu metaphor used all over both iOS and Android is 3 dots on the right (doesn't look like a hamburger so it isn't as maligned but has identical problems when not used consistently).  This is usually used to show a contextual list based on where the user is rather than an omnipresent top left list menu. Going back to my point for this paragraph... what are you using it for? Is it a clearly delineated list of concise items that is contextually relevant to where the user is in the app? Could it be better implemented using a different design pattern?

4019,4019,6416,XOR Gate design problem,"I just recently started trying out on electronics engineering, and have built a OR gate, NOT gate and a AND gate using NPN transistors. When building the XOR gate, this is my design:



However, SW2 will not activate the LED due to the current at the base of Q4 (activated by SW2) activates Q5 to bypass the LED. Thus, the Q3 &amp; Q4's AND gate does not work. Is there any way I can get the between Q4 and Q5 to not flow unless both Q3 and Q4 have been activated?

Thanks in advance! I'm such a newbie.

P.S. The simulation lets the current flow from the positive side to the negative side.
",ihsoy ih,https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/27005,"Conceptually, I can see why you implemented the circuit this way:


If either of SW1 or SW2 is closed - either Q1 or Q2 will conduct and the current will flow to the LED
However, if both SW1 and SW2 are closed - both Q3 and Q4 will conduct which will cause Q5 to conduct. When Q5 is conducting, there is not enough voltage on LED to turn it on


Good thinking, really.

However, BJTs have high current gain (\$\beta\approx100\$). It means that even a low current to the base of Q5 will be amplified and the LED won't turn on. But how comes there is a current to the base of Q5 when SW1 is open? Isn't Q3 behaves as an open circuit when SW1 is open? The answer is NO - BJT transistors have very interesting behavior when operated with floating base. They are not, in general, behave like an open circuit.

What can you do? Well, in real applications you wouldn't design and use such a circuit. However, given that you are educating yourself (and me too), I'd suggest you try to apply the following changes:


Why did you choose 9V power supply? Each BJT has a maximum rating for \$V_{CE}\$ - check the model file that you're using and change your power supply accordingly. How this may help? Well, reducing \$V_{CE}\$ of Q3 may cause it to behave more like an open circuit when SW1 is open.
Try to add pull-down resistors between bases of Q3 and Q4 and the ground (these resistors must be pretty large). This approach will prevent the base of Q3 from being floating when SW1 is open (respectively for Q4 and SW2).
If none of the above worked, I suggest you'll try to find a way of ""stealing"" the current from the led which is not that sensitive to small unwanted currents as a single transistor. You may try to replace Q5 with Q3 and Q4 directly (collector of Q3 is connected in place of Q5's collector, emitter of Q4 is connected to ground).

My idea is the following: instead of appending all the downloaded data in NSData and at the very end of the download, when I got all data, to store it to a file, I want to execute the download asynchronously in a separate thread and append to a file each received chunk and free my memory, but be certain that if the connection is dropped or the app crashes the download would resume automatically from the last chunk without corrupting the file.

I've been able to do it: 

Split[AA, First[#1] === First[#2] &amp;]


But I do not understand the theory behind it. This is how far I got


  Split[list, test] treats pairs of adjacent elements as identical 
  whenever applying the function test to them yields True. 


From this I get that Split is a function where AA is my list, and that it splits the data into groups when the test yields true. 

But I get confused here. 

First[#1] === First[#2] &amp;

First[{a, b, c}] 



  a


Based on this I get that it picks the first element of the list within the list, in my case ""KO"" This means that when First[#1] equals First[#2], it yields true. However, I don't understand the function of #.

How does this predicate function work? Does it take

Row 1 column 1 = Row 2 column 1 --&gt; False
Row 2 column 1 = Row 3 column 1 --&gt; True 
Row 3 Column 1 = Row 4 column 1 --&gt; True 
...


and then group all the True and all the False together and create seperate lists? 

Same function again: 

I'm just not sure what #1 does in the list and what #2 does in the list and why &amp; needs to be added at the end. 

Same function as above ---> Split[AA, First[#1] === First[#2] &amp;]

4453,4453,7066,Is it ethical to profit by having my students buy my textbook?,"This question was suggested to me by How can I sell my text book to my students in e-book format? which asked about the practicalities, but attracted many comments about the ethics.  So this question is to ask about the ethics directly.

Suppose I have written and published a textbook, and I want to use it as the text for a course I am teaching.  I receive royalties from each copy of my book that is sold, so if my students are required to buy my textbook for the course, I will make some money.  Is it ethical to do so?

Well-reasoned opinions would be useful answers, but even more useful would be pointers to institutional policies, professional codes of ethics, etc, that address this issue.

Of course, there are many ways to avoid profiting from the sale of my book to my students.  If my contract with my publisher allows it, I could distribute PDFs to my students, or have the university bookstore print out copies and sell them at cost.  Another approach I've heard of is to compute how much I earn in royalties on each copy, and refund that amount from my pocket to each student who buys a copy.  Or, use my royalty earnings to buy pizza for the class.  Certainly these are nice gestures, but I would like opinions on whether they are ethically required.

Edit: To address some questions that have arisen in the comments:


This question is hypothetical.  I haven't published any textbooks myself and have no immediate plans to do so.  In any case, my personal preference would be to make the book available to students for free, if at all possible.  So I've phrased this question in the first person for rhetorical convenience only.
I had intended the question to be only about the potential financial conflict of interest that could arise if I make money by assigning my own book.  Some of the answers feel that it is improper for me to assign my own textbook at all, whether I make money or not, but I don't think this point of view is prevalent within the academic community.  If it happens that my book (as a pithy but now-deleted comment put it) ""blows"", I think most would agree that my decision to assign it is pedagogically unfortunate, but not unethical.  
I don't literally mean that students would be required to buy the book, only that they'd be expected to have it.  I might assign readings or homework problems from the book, so that the student needs access to the book in order to do them, but they could certainly achieve this by getting a used copy or borrowing from a friend.  But probably most students would buy new copies anyway, since that is the most convenient way.

",Nate Eldredge,https://academia.stackexchange.com/users/1010,"Short answer: I think it is neither ethical nor good (in terms of education, independent of ethics) to force students to use your textbook.

(Assuming that we are talking about a ""normal"" lecture, as opposed to a workshop about your book.)



Long answer: I see 3 different (but connected) difficulties here. None of them needs to be a problem, but together, they can trap the students. 


requiring a particular textbook: to me this is less of an ethical problem if it doesn't boil down to forcing the students to buy that particular book.
Nevertheless, I think it preferable from an education point of view to teach students that they left the kind of school where exactly one solution exists, and now they are in a world with lots of sensible alternatives. Giving  recommendations* (plural!), IMHO it is a most important point to make that the library holds even more useful books [also on that topic].
more or less forcing students to buy a textbook  


(Recall that the origin of ""lecture"" is that a (text)book was read to the students. So historically, the lecture was a solution to the problem that books were too expensive for students to buy.)


I don't see why buying the textbook is necessary. Even if book and lecture are (naturally) close. 


  I might assign readings or homework problems from the book, so that the student needs access to the book in order to do them


Why would that be:


Is is that difficult to prepare a slide of the homework problem which is displayed at the end of the lecture or a pdf that can be downloaded?
Reading: I have to say that at university I've never experienced assigned reading from a textbook. So my question to you is: is it really necessary to assign reading chapter 7.4 as opposed to assign preparing the principles of pH electrodes? Also, I've seen reading materials for download.
Making small parts of the book available to the students is probably possible even if the contract with the publisher doesn't let you distribute pdfs to the students. At least, e.g. in Germany, it is even possible to hand small parts from any book (not only yours!) to the class for teaching purposes.
For the self-study aspect of the textbook, there is the textbook collection of the library. The university libraries I know have sensible numbers of the important textbooks to be borrowed by the students plus a number of copies that stay in the library so they are always accessible.  Are the books there really not sufficient? If so, why not? Why are the important books not there? How can books be bought?
(How to get your book into the collection is part of the next point:)

Possible conflict of interest because it is your own textbook.
This is the interesting part. But, if you take care of the first two problems, there is already much less space for an actual conflict of interest (≈ a real problem for the students) here.
Or, taking another point of view, I perceive taking unfair advantage of the position***  as a symptom of (un)ethical behaviour which is closely bound to the whole character. In that I perceive it less of a single problem that is solved or not by a particular line of action on this point but rather a problem that appears with some people and not with others.
In yet other words, people who take advantage of their position tend to do that in more ways than just this (e.g. in the combination of my three points - at which point @JeffE probably recommends to run). The formal action of not requiring their own textbook doesn't help much. Students will conclude from the general reputation/perception of taking unfair advantage that the book is required - whether it is stated openly or not. 


I guess it is one of the topics where those who do worry whether what they do is ethical are the ones who don't need to worry (because they do act ethically) - it would be far more important that those who don't would start to worry...

Whether to donate copies of your own textbook to the library, 
make a donation that reimburses the library for your royalties, or 
convince the library to buy it like any other book, and/or 
whether and how you want to reimburse students 
is IMHO unanswerable as a general question.
I think valid points can be made for and against** each of the options here.

Good and sensible decisions will depend a lot on the particular circumstances and even more on the personality of the professor.



Side note: 


  Or, use my royalty earnings to buy pizza for the class.


I object to this option on the following ethical grounds: If my problem is that I'm too poor to buy textbooks, I don't want to spend money on pizza but would rather like to save that money towards the next textbook. 



* A professor not recommending his own textbook sounds about as convincing to me as a vegetarian running a sausage factory. 

** Here's the advocatus diaboli against each of the points:


Donating books to the library? Someone is buying fame!
Reimbursing the royalties - same as above, but more greedy (or the one above was more desperate for fame...)
Convinced some committee to buy the books? Surely there is a textbook-buying circle emerging: You scratch my back and I'll scratch yours.  
reimbursing students who buy the book: that's an obvious attempt to whitewash the reputation
and so on

5368,5368,8527,"What do you call a customer's customer in a specification document, use case, or scenario?","My team and I develop software that our customers will use to interact with their customers.  Additionally, we also eat our own dogfood and use the software ourselves to interact with our customers.

Therefore, it can sometimes be difficult to explain use cases and scenarios, as our employees can be operators, our customers can be operators, and our customers' customers can be visitors.

However, our customers can also be visitors interacting with our operator employees, our customers' customers can be visitors interacting with our customer or our employee.

Here is a model where:

A is an employee
B is a customer
C is our customers' customer

X  interacts with  Y
Operator --&gt; Visitor
      A  --&gt;  B
      A  --&gt;  C
      B  --&gt;  C


Because sometimes our customers can play different roles, it's sometimes necessary to refer to the specific role, Operator or Visitor, instead of Employee and Customer.

It's also a mouthful to say ""customer's customer"" all the time.

I was wondering how other development shops handle these semantic details when writing their use cases and scenarios.  


Are there any one-word, generic terms that can apply to any product that involves a third-level actor?
Other than using the specific roles, Operator and Visitor, what words could be used to identify a customer of a customer?  


The word would need to be short enough as to be adopted within an organization.  If longer than a couple syllables, it's shortened form must still differentiate it from the other actors.

3459,3459,5509,How can I tell when music is live and not recorded?,"I was walking past a bar the other day and heard music coming out. I could immediately tell that the music was live, being played in the bar at that moment. This is something I have often noticed, I can tell whether music is recorded or being played live. 

This seems to extend to recordings of live music as well. I have often found myself identifying that the musical background of, for example, a youtube video was being played at the time and was recorded using the same microphone that recorded the ambient sound of the video.

First of all, I assume that I am not alone and that any musician or music lover can also make this distinction. So, why can we do this? What is it that allows us to recognize live performances? I assume it has something to do with the way they are recorded (or not as the case may be) and that a good sound engineer would be able to fix things so that I couldn't tell but what does it depend on?
",terdon,https://music.stackexchange.com/users/9576,"Recorded music has the acoustics of two rooms.  Strongly amplified live music actually tends to have a lot more problems than studio music because you have the mics also picking up the PA and the environment and the sound intended for other mics.  Of course, that does not hold for electric guitars and other instruments amplified without microphones.

Unplugged music is rather direct and clear.  Recorded music only picks up the sound at a number of defined points and gets mixed to two channels usually.  A lot of spatial information gets lost in that way.

That's one reason that Hammond organs have been semi-popular: the rotating Leslie speakers used with them create a great spacy sound in concert, but the effect is practically not recordable in a manner reproducing its character well.

Strongly amplified live music actually tends to have a lot more problems than studio music because you have the mics also picking up the PA and the environment and the sound intended for other mics.  Of course, that does not hold for electric guitars and other instruments amplified without microphones.

Unplugged music is rather direct and clear.  Recorded music only picks up the sound at a number of defined points and gets mixed to two channels usually.  A lot of spatial information gets lost in that way.

That's one reason that Hammond organs have been semi-popular: the rotating Leslie speakers used with them create a great spacy sound in concert, but the effect is practically not recordable in a manner reproducing its character well.  Neither for replay of recordings, nor for remitting over a big powerful PA.

With use of arc cosine, I think this would give me the correct result. But since arc cosine is a computational expensive function in computer programming, I need to avoid it.

$$\frac{cos^{-1}(a * b)}{180^°}-1$$

It is acceptable that the solution doesn't return the same values as the formula above. It's just important that the output depends (not necessarily linear) on the angle and is in the range from $-1$ to $1$.

1644,1644,2586,Rate-limiting in transition state theory,"Suppose an initial state $A$ can transition to either state $C$ or state $D$. Suppose further that both of these two processes are rate-limited by a transition to the same intermediate state $B$, as follows:



Note that $\Delta G_{AB}&gt; \Delta G_{BC}&gt;\Delta G_{BD}$.

According to transition state theory, rates are determined by the rate-limiting step. So the rate of each process will be the same,

\begin{align}
r_{A\to C}&amp;=r_{A\to B} \\
r_{A\to D}&amp;=r_{A\to B}
\end{align}

from which it follows that the number of transitions made during some large $\Delta t$ will also be the same,

\begin{align}
N_{A\to C}&amp;=r_{A\to B}\Delta t \\
N_{A\to D}&amp;=r_{A\to B}\Delta t
\end{align}

However, if we were to consider the two pathways collectively then we would predict more transitions to be made to state $D$ than $B$ since $\Delta G_{BD}&lt;\Delta G_{BC}$.

How do we resolve this apparent discrepancy?
",lemon,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/users/7265,"On remark: just because activation energy high/low it doesn't necessarily mean that reaction is slow or fast. You cannot tell this without the pre-exponential factor. 

The answer: Off course, the original statement should not applied as you do it. 
""According to transition state theory, rates are determined by the rate-limiting step."" doesn't mean automatically that all the reaction rates are equal.

A to B conversion is slow compared to other processes, is true, but still B to C and B to D are competing processes. The original statement only means that B will not build up in bigger quantities, so during the reaction all the final products (C and D together) are approximately equal with the used A after you consider stoichimetries.

Edited for clarification (sorry, pretty new to LaTex):

You should consider all the transformations as independent equations. Black magic is not involved, ""rate determining step"" and such only helps making approximations so one can solve the coupled differential equations on napkin.

Example 1. 

Let us assume a reaction system with $A \to B \to C$. The kinetics of the system can be describe by two independent equations

$A \to B$ with a corresponding $k1$ and  $B \to C$ with a corresponding $k2$

To describe conversions we can get different equations:

$$ \frac{d[A]}{dt} = -k1 [A] $$ 

$$ \frac{d[B]}{dt} = k1 [A] - k2 [B]$$ 

$$ \frac{d[C]}{dt} = k2 [B] $$ 

We see that it is already pretty messy, so assumptions like $k1 &lt;&lt; k2$ can help. The general way is that we say, this difference in the rate constants allows us to asume  $$ \frac{d[B]}{dt} \approx 0 $$. So we have  pipeline, and in first approximation have that much $B \to C$ conversion going as $A \to B$. I.e. the is no ""clogging"" in the middle. Not much magic here.

Example 2.

Now what if we have e.g. two slow reactions as second step instead of one? Noting special:
$A\to B$ , with $k1$,
$B\to C$ , with $k2$,
$B\to D$ , with $k3$ 
which translates to 

$$ \frac{d[A]}{dt} = -k1 [A] $$ 

$$ \frac{d[B]}{dt} = k1 [A] -( k2 [B] + k3 [B])$$ 

$$ \frac{d[C]}{dt} = k2 [B] $$ 

$$ \frac{d[D]}{dt} = k3 [B] $$ 

Now we have the same assumption that the first step is much slower than the others than 

$$ \frac{d[B]}{dt} = k1 [A] -( k2 [B] + k3 [B]) \approx 0$$

I think you can try it from here and see how the rates comes out.

317,317,509,Why don't banks give access to all your transaction activity?,"In the era of big data, I find it surprising that banks and credit card companies only offer access to a ridiculously small number of transactions - often only your last 180 days, if that. The longest I've seen was 720 days going back. I suspect they do store everything, but intentionally limit access.

These transactions are text only, take up extremely little space, and storing an individual's lifetime worth of transaction would take less than 10MB of data; about the storage required by two MP3 files, and about 250k records per person per lifetime, if we generously assume everyone makes 10 transactions a day. But I'd be happy with only the last 10 years of transactions, so about 1MB per customer. One of the largest banks, JP Morgan Chase, has ~70MM credit card customers. That means 70TB of data for 10 years of records - hardly impressive for a corporation of that size, with $17B of net income in 2013, when 1TB of cloud storage costs $10 retail per month.

By comparison, would you put up with Gmail or any online email provider keeping only the most recent 120 days worth of email? (And emails do take a lot more space than transactions, are far more numerous, and have to be instantly retrievable.)

Storage requirements for transaction activity are trivial in an era where we're throwing around petabytes and zetabytes.

Is there a sound reason for banks not offering access to all your transactions, other than legacy software on their side?

  ""Things are the way they are because they got that way.""
  - Gerald Weinberg


Banks have been in business for a very long time. Yet, much of what we take for granted in terms of technology (capabilities, capacity, and cost) are relatively recent developments.

Banks are often stuck on older platforms (mainframe, for instance) where the cost of redundant online storage far exceeds the commodity price consumers take for granted. Similarly, software enhancements that require back-end changes can be more complicated.

Moreover, unless there's a buck (or billion) to be made, banks just tend to move slowly compared to the rest of the business world. Overcoming ""but we've always done it that way"" is an incredible hurdle in a large, established organization like a bank &mdash; and so things don't generally improve without great effort. I've had friends who've worked inside technology divisions at big banks tell me as much.

I guess not.
It seems to me that science and copyright are not compatible. 

Let's say I wrote a very important paper in, say, cell biology.
Suppose I have the copyright for the paper(I think so under the copyright law of the US).
Then I also have the derivative-work copyright.
Can I exercise the right?
For example, can I refuse other people to use the original idea of my paper?
Or can I forbid them using an original technical procedure described in my paper? Or what about copying graphs or figures?

No, using your ideas is not enough to turn another paper into a derivative work.

No, copyright is not relevant.  It keeps people from copying your description of the procedure; instead, they have to rewrite it in their own words.  However, copyright has nothing to do with using the procedure.

Patents could be relevant, if the technical procedure is patented, but that's completely different from copyright (and there are no automatic patents, the way people automatically get copyright).  You could certainly debate whether patents are a problem for science, but this has nothing to do with copyright.

I believe the far right location is because you don't want user to accidentally click on delete. 

It depends. For a really long (tall) table, try using a sticky table header so it's always viewable.

1103,1103,1736,why ions and electrons are at different temperatures in plasma?,"In plasma, collision rate among ions or electrons is much larger than the collision rate between ions and electrons. why is that so?
",seeking_infinity,https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/57676,"Consider a plasma that just's been formed and then left alone. Being far from equilibrium, the plasma will evolve towards an equilibrium state. At this stage, it's not very useful to characterize the plasma with a temperature because the velocity distribution would bear little resemblance to a Boltzmann distribution, or really any kind of distribution function with meaningful moments. 

Let's assume that the plasma is being driven towards equilibrium by collision events. The particles will lose energy during each inelastic collision event, with some being more inelastic than others. The degree of inelasticity will depend significantly on the mass ratio: ion-ion collisions and electron-electron collisions will be inelastic compared to ion-electron collisions.

Since the $i-i$ and $e-e$ collisions are relatively inelastic, it often occurs that the ions and electrons quickly develop their own ""temperatures"". The ion velocity distribution rapidly approaches a Boltzmann distribution with temperature, and the electrons also rapidly approach a Boltzmann distribution with some different temperature. If you were to superpose the two, you'd get a funny-looking distribution with a tall top and wide tails, i.e. not global equilibrium. 

The ""centeredness"" or ""tailedness"" (basically kurtosis) of the total distribution tells you how far from equilibrium the plasma is. The further the system is from equilibrium, the faster it will try to equilibrate via collisions. So if the temperatures are very different, the $i-e$ collision frequency will be high. If the temperatures are not too different, the $i-e$ will be lower, but still higher than the $e-e$ and $i-i$ systems that have already approximately equilibrated with themselves.

Note: In laboratory experiments, it's common to produce plasmas whose ions and electrons do not settle to a Boltzmann distribution. In that case, the kurtosis argument flies out the window. Another major complication arises if the electrons and ions have different flow speeds, where so-called ""two-stream"" or ""bump-on-tail"" instabilities become important in the equilibration physics.

The size of my database is near about 4GB(Only .mdf file).

This is a huge table means everyday near about 80000 data inserted and same no. of records deleted. There are 30 days * 80000 records present in that table. This table is used very frequently. Hence it takes time to query large data. So my development team decided to create Partition of same table. Table11 has four columns in primary key. 
Primary Key Columns :


ChequeDate Date
RunNo Int
SorterNo Int
SequenceNo Int


We decided to partition the table on the basis of SequenceNo column.

I created a partition script and ran it which partitions an existing table. This works perfectly.
Next I run a ""rollback"" script to remove the partitioning. This also runs perfectly.

When I try to reapply partitioning on the same table it gives me the error mentioned in title. I found a manual solution that worked for me.

My problem is this process should run from a script only. No manual work should be necessary.

I assume that the problem is in the rollback script:

ALTER TABLE [dbo].[Table1] DROP CONSTRAINT [PK_Table1] with (move to [primary]);
DROP PARTITION SCHEME Table1PartSch
DROP PARTITION FUNCTION Table1PartFunc

This returned several false hits on HTML select tags, so I refined my command to

awk '/[^&lt;]select[^&gt;]/,/from/' *


which seems to have eliminated most of those hits.

However, I still get some false hits from occurrences of the word ""select"" in a comment, and those hits produce very many lines of noise each before they eventually hit a ""from"" or the end of the file.
What I would like is for the range pattern not to register a match if there are more than, say, 10 lines between the ""select"" and the ""from"".

My question is: Can I make the range pattern fail to match if the number of lines between the match of pattern1 and the match of pattern2 exceeds a given threshold, and if so, how?

4885,4885,7775,Do parallel realities take precedence over time travel in the Star Trek Universe?,"The 2009 Star Trek movie and its pending sequels are based on the concept of parallel realities introduced in the season 7 Next Generation episode ""Parallels,"" laying out that anything that could happen has happened in a parallel universe. The Enterprise and its crew from the most recent movie are part of a parallel reality that was created when Nero and Spock came back through the black hole created by red matter in an attempt to stem the destruction caused by a supernova. For clarification, this crew will be referred to as Chris Pine's and the older movies as Shatner's.

In the movie Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home, a probe shows up in 2286 at Earth looking for whales that had disappeared decades before. Shatner's crew is faced with travelling back in time to try and retrieve two humpback whales in order to stop the cylindrical probe from destroying Earth. They do this using a Klingon Bird-of-Prey that was stolen in the previous movie, going back to 1986 to find the whales.

I think it's safe to assume that in Pine's reality, the probe will probably make an appearance again, since the destruction of whales probably wouldn't change. So Pine's crew will also be faced with the dilemma of travelling back to find humpbacks (although probably without using a Klingon ship).

If Pine's crew also goes back to the same instant in 1986 as Shatner's crew to find whales (which seems highly improbable given that hitting the same time period as Shatner would be ridiculous), would they run into Shatner's crew or would it create another parallel reality stemming from 1986? If it created another reality, that seems like some kind of backwards causality since the event that would be causing the new stem wouldn't be the instant before the ships arrived but an event in the future.

2622,2622,4170,Have I Been Misplaying France in Diplomacy?,"France is considered one of the ""better"" countries to play in Diplomacy. That's true insofar as it a ""corner"" and not a ""center"" country like Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Italy.

In descending order, my favorite strategies are 1) Go for the Mediterranean, 2) Ally with England vs. Germany 3) Ally with Germany Vs. England. But I've found France a tough, frustrating country to play when one can't use a Mediterranean strategy (because of what's going on elsewhere). A couple examples:

In one game, England ""allied"" with me against Germany, than stabbed me, leading to a Franco-German alliance (my least favorite). Meanwhile, Italy stabbed Austria, A Venice-Trieste, and got two builds in 1901, three in 1902, and had her choice of allies: with Russia vs. Turkey and Germany, with England vs. France.

In another game, I had to ward off an Anglo-German invasion. But the English army that went to Belgium marched into the Ruhr, again leading to a Franco-German alliance. But by the time we reshuffled the alliance, Austria-Hungary had stabbed Italy, overextended in a Lepanto opening, captured Venice and Rome, and dominated the Med. With Turkey, Italy, and the Balkans, Austria and Russia had the 18 centers to declare themselves co-winners.

Have I been misplaying France? Or has my inability to control the Med been due to my northern troubles, and the Austro-Italian imbalances? Can I hope for a more ""fortunate"" result playing France in future games, against, say, random opponents?
",Tom Au,https://boardgames.stackexchange.com/users/1344,"It sounds to me like both games you've failed to negotiate an alliance with England.

It sounds like in both games you stumbled into an FG alliance that was not in a strong position.  You might do better if you attempted to negotiate the FG alliance from the start.  That way you can be directing the flow of the conflict, rather than reacting to it.
England is likely worried that in an EF alliance, F usually grows faster and is in a more solid position after taking down Germany, while E ends up overextended.  So you'll likely need to give him the better side of the split, and make it clear that you are committing to the South so that E knows he isn't the next target.  You can also make things easier by making sure that England has a good path to grow after the initial attack on Germany, which generally means you want a weak Russia.  At the same time, don't make yourself too inviting of a target for E.  Many alliances are broken due to people who are too trusting and make it too easy for their partner to stab.

736,736,1169,Why don't banks give access to all your transaction activity?,"In the era of big data, I find it surprising that banks and credit card companies only offer access to a ridiculously small number of transactions - often only your last 180 days, if that. The longest I've seen was 720 days going back. I suspect they do store everything, but intentionally limit access.

These transactions are text only, take up extremely little space, and storing an individual's lifetime worth of transaction would take less than 10MB of data; about the storage required by two MP3 files, and about 250k records per person per lifetime, if we generously assume everyone makes 10 transactions a day. But I'd be happy with only the last 10 years of transactions, so about 1MB per customer. One of the largest banks, JP Morgan Chase, has ~70MM credit card customers. That means 70TB of data for 10 years of records - hardly impressive for a corporation of that size, with $17B of net income in 2013, when 1TB of cloud storage costs $10 retail per month.

By comparison, would you put up with Gmail or any online email provider keeping only the most recent 120 days worth of email? (And emails do take a lot more space than transactions, are far more numerous, and have to be instantly retrievable.)

Storage requirements for transaction activity are trivial in an era where we're throwing around petabytes and zetabytes.

Is there a sound reason for banks not offering access to all your transactions, other than legacy software on their side?

5164,5164,8205,Chaining deferreds,"I have a lot of functions that currently look like this:

function LoadFromURL(url) 
{
    var d = $.Deferred();
    $.get(url).then(function(text)
    {
        LoadFromText(text).then(function(obj)
        {
            d.resolve(obj);
        }, 
        function(err)
        {
            d.reject(err);
        });
    }, 
    function(err)
    {
        d.reject(err);
    });
    return d.promise();
}


This function takes a URL and loads the text within a promise. The text is then passed to the LoadFromText function which returns another promise. If this succeeds, the outer deferred is resolved. If the URL cannot be loaded, or the LoadFromText function fails then the outer deferred is rejected.

Is there a way that I can chain the result of the resolve / reject and end up with something like this:

function LoadFromURL(url) 
{
    return $.get(url).then(function(text)
    {
        return LoadFromText(text);
    }, 
    function(err)
    {
        return $.Deferred().reject(err);
    }).promise();
}


I've seen some implementations of promises that allow this - returning a promise within 'then', means that the eventual result of the promise is used. 

I realise this doesn't work at the moment (the result is the promise, rather than the result of the promise), but hopefully someone can suggest a way to make this work so I can tidy up the sometimes confusing mess of the first example.

I hope this makes sense. Thanks.

As you can see, the bottom-right point of the diamond is perfectly on the path, but the top-left point is clearly above the path.  It appears that the diamond lies on the tangent line of the path at the bottom-right point of the diamond.

Question:

How can I place this open diamond arrow tip so that both points of the diamond are on the path?

Bonus Question:

What is the best solution to make the area inside the diamond completely white? I don't want to see the path in the inside of the diamond.  I currently have a solution that I feel is a hack, which is to place a white (closed) diamond arrow tip in the same spot first:

27,27,38,Why is the potential function defined differently in physics and calculus?,"I am very familiar with the concept of a potential function, and potential energy, from calculus-based physics.

For instance, if we have the familiar force field $\mathbf{F} = -mg \,\mathbf{j}$, then a potential function is given by $U = mgy + C$. (Since potential energy is relative, we have an infinite number of potential functions.)

Notice that the gradient of the potential function is the negative of the force field: $$\nabla U = \nabla(mgy + C) = mg \,\mathbf{j} = -\mathbf{F}.$$

That was perfectly fine with me. But now in vector calculus, I am reading that the potential function $f$ of a vector function $\mathbf{F}$ is such that $\nabla f = \mathbf{F}$. A negative sign appears to have been lost when migrating from physics to calculus.

It seems confusing to call $f$ a ""potential function"", since it cannot be interpreted as potential energy in the real world. So why is the calculus nomenclature as it is (i.e., why not call this something else and then say the potential function is the negative of it)?

4487,4487,7115,How does the colour of ambient lighting affect colour rendition?,"How does the colour of ambient lighting affect colour rendition?

For example:

If I stand under a sodium-vapour (orange) streetlight and calibrate my camera's white balance, what effect would this have if I were to take a photo of a colour test chart?  Presumably, white would still render as white due to the white balance calibration, but how would other colours be rendered?

How would the result differ under primary and secondary coloured lighting, e.g. a red or yellow light?

Thanks.
",gjb,https://photo.stackexchange.com/users/3775,"The issue with these sorts of light sources isn't the color temperature, but rather the spectrum provided by the light.

A camera (or your eyes) can only record colors which are reflected from the objects in the scene (not counting objects which have fluorescent properties). If the light shining on the object doesn't contain a certain color, it can't bounce to you, and therefore the color of the object can't be recorded in the way it might be under full spectrum light.

In your specific example of a sodium-vapor light, the color spectrum looks like this:

CC-BY-SA image from Wikimedia Commons, author Philips Lighting

You can see that there's a very narrow spike of light just short of 600nm, which is quite yellow. Everything you see (or photograph) will be in terms of how the object reflects light in that narrow band. So your assumption is correct — you can shift what is recorded as neutral grey/white, but your chart will probably look quite strange and ""inaccurate"". And there's really nothing you can do about it besides bringing in other lighting.

If your other lighting is also narrow-spectrum, that will improve rendition of the colors it adds — pretty simple, except when it comes to getting everything in your scene lit the way you'd like it to be with each different color.

A camera (or your eyes) can only record colors which are reflected from the objects in the scene (not counting objects which have fluorescent properties). If the light shining on the object doesn't contain a certain color, it can't bounce to you, and therefore the color of the object can't be recorded in the way it might be under full spectrum light.

In your specific example of a sodium-vapor light, the color spectrum looks like this:

CC-BY-SA image from Wikimedia Commons, author Philips Lighting

You can see that there's a very narrow spike of light just short of 600nm, which is quite yellow. Everything you see (or photograph) will be in terms of how the object reflects light in that narrow band. So your assumption is correct — you can shift what is recorded as neutral grey/white, but your chart will probably look quite strange and ""inaccurate"". And there's really nothing you can do about it besides bringing in other lighting.

If your other lighting is also narrow-spectrum, that will improve rendition of the colors it adds — pretty simple, except when it comes to getting everything in your scene lit the way you'd like it to be with each different color. And your white balance will need to be more of a compromise (probably you'd pick something which would preserve both strong color casts, rather than attempting to neutralize them).

In my mind, this is the wrong question.  For many ""bad comments,"" it would most likely be better to not comment at all, and simply use the voting and moderation tools.

Ultimately, the answer isn't some sort of awk or perl script that will turn a rude comment into a constructive comment, but to change our attitudes from dealing with questions as efficiently as possible to dealing with human beings with questions.

The only thing more frustrating than a rude comment is a ""polite"" comment given through gritted teeth, or belied by every other aspect of the person's behavior.  A 30 minute hold time is not soothed by the recorded reminder that ""your call is very important to us"" every 20 seconds.

5173,5173,8220,How can I enable HttpOnly cookies in EE,"Update:
Thanks to Dom Stubbs, I have an extension to accomplish this now.  It is up on devot-ee and also up on GitHub.  Thanks Dom!

The Original Question

I am nearly through a security review of a new EE2 version of an existing EE1 site that I hope to launch soon.  One of the final issues remaining is to make the cookies HttpOnly.  I've tried doing that through this line in the apache config:

Header edit Set-Cookie ""(?i)^((?:(?!;\s?HttpOnly).)+)$"" ""$1; HttpOnly""


Using the dev tools in my browser I can see that it does indeed append HttpOnly to the Set-Cookie headers, but the issue then becomes that I cannot log in.  When I asked Ellislab they tell me that the cookies should not be being dealt with in javascript, which was what I expected the issue might be.

ExpressionEngine does not seem to use the session libraries from codeignitor, if it did I could set a config variable to turn httponly on, but it looks like the session handling code is in the expressionengine side of things.

The real question that I need answered is how can I make HttpOnly cookies work, but I guess that breaks down into some potential subquestions:


Am I missing an addon that would allow me to do this without a lot more heartache?Is there something wrong with my apache approach?  Are you able to log in if you enable that in Apache, log out and try to log back in?
Is there something wrong with my apache approach?  Are you able to log in if you enable that in Apache, log out and try to log back in?
Failing these, can anybody give me a hint as to where cookies are being set in expressionengine so I can dig in there and try to fix this?

",UltraBob,https://expressionengine.stackexchange.com/users/268,"I've not attempted to implement HttpOnly cookies with EE, but doing so should be relatively straightforward. If you go to line 805 of Functions.php you'll see the setcookie() call EE uses. Directly above that is the set_cookie_end hook.

They are attacking the village because they are evil, they are stealing the princess because they are evil, etc.

Over time, my group needs have grown to need more complicated and detailed villains. It is important to consider motives.  What is it that defines them as 'evil' to the party?  In terms of a fantasy setting, what would you consider to be an interesting villain?

What qualities make a villain that inspires your party to rally against him?  What kind of villains have worked for your games in the past?

Example:


  A member of nobility is using trade connections to move valuable pieces of art into another country that is secretly paying him quite well and is framing a member of the party to take the fall.  In addition, someone important to the party member has been taken hostage with a promise of release once they party member takes the blame for the crime.

Original key components. Frame, fork. (Aluminum frame, carbon fork)

A few visible minor dings here and there.


Question: Is the frame/fork safe? I can sell it or trash it. 
",none,https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/users/4389,"If it were a steel frame and fork there would be no question -- steel lasts nearly forever, even when moderately rusty, and can take all sorts of abuse.

Aluminum is a bit less robust, but if it only has ""a few thousand"" miles on it (and not 30,000) and has not been abused (or hit by a car) then it should be good.  The problem with aluminum is that it can develop hidden cracks, but you've given us no reason to suspect that of this bike.

The carbon fork is also less robust than steel, and can develop hidden cracks.  But again, unless there's something in its history to make it suspect then it should be fine.

Certainly age is not a problem.  Nothing really ""ages"" on a bike beyond the tires (and, to a slight extent, the lubes).  (It could be true that the carbon fiber will deteriorate after 50 years or so, but that's something for your grandchildren to worry about.)

167,167,264,Voltage ratings of capacitors: ceramic vs electrolytic,"Now I know when it comes to electrolytic capacitors it's usually good practice to use a voltage rating 1.5x - 2.5x the maximum rating you ever expect the capacitor to be exposed to, as the lifetime can be significantly reduced by running it near its limits.

But does the same protocol apply to ceramic capacitors? For example, assume a 25V ceramic capacitor - will running it at 24V reduce its lifespan significantly?

I'm currently designing a PSU which needs to be reliable, so at the moment I'm using 50V caps for a maximum 20V input (35V caps aren't available), but I'd like to switch to 25V caps if possible.
",Thomas O,https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/1225,"You do not have the same lifespan issues with ceramic caps. You will lose 
capacitance as the voltage increases. The amount you lose is dependant
on the dielectric.

When choosing the electrolytics you also need to look at the ESR, temperature
rating and the maximum operating temperature. Since the lifetime is predicted
using the Arrhenius activation energy law running using a 105°C rated
cap will give you a significant increase over running a 85°C cap (assuming
all other conditions are the same). There are some 5000 hour rated electrolytics.

5884,5884,9320,"What is the Goal of ""Hot Network Questions""?","There has been a tug-of-war in the hot-questions list.

Community members like JonW seem to be unhappy with the traffic that it brings to their site:


  'But we want to encourage people to post, that's the whole point of the HQ list!' I hear you cry. I disagree. We want to encourage people to the site not just to that question.


The SE Community Team seems to have a different opinion as Shog9 points out (emphasis mine):


  the results have been... Not great so far: a significantly smaller number of people are clicking through to randomly-selected questions than to the top questions, which hints that the algorithm may've been doing a better job of identifying general-interest questions across topics than some expected.


Disclaimer: This should not be taken as a slight of the community team whatsoever, nor do I think this is some cause for revolt or a boxing match as the below prose may indicate. These are just poorly applied literary tools to emphasize the drastically different approaches to the same list between two groups.

In the Red Corner, the Community Members

The goal of the hot questions should be to drive up interest in the site. The hot questions should be a lure to encourage SE network users to contribute to other content, not just do a drive-by on the hot question.

In the Blue Corner, the Community Team

The goal of the hot questions should be to drive traffic to general-interest questions. After all, the Hot Network Questions used to be more accurately named as ""Popular Questions"".

What is the Goal of Advertising Network Questions?

Before discussing how to calculate hotness, or how the list should be ordered, we need to come to an agreement on what the heck we are actually trying to achieve. Once we know what we are looking to accomplish, we can find the best way to do that.

The list of questions from a variety of sites is in a great location screen-wise, it is readily accessible and does get a lot of eyes on it. But as with any marketing, the goal isn't just to grab eyes, it's to grab the right eyes.*

* I have nothing against left eyes. Most of my friends have left eyes too. And they are awesome. But in the context right eyes are not a geospatial thing, but rather in the 'correct' sense.

So what are the right eyes? What type of people do we want to attract to our site? What would we determine as 'success'? How can we measure that success?

Please do not limit yourself to the very narrowly scoped topic above. Think outside the box if you'd like. On every page across the network we have a nice piece of real estate for showing off the rest of the network. How can that space best be used if not on a list of questions picked by an arbitrary algorithm?

How does &quot;be altruist to those who are similar to you&quot; evolve?

Altruism that is


Not reciprocal
Not familiar


has little explanation. One possible explanation is that the trait itself may correlate well with genetics. One great answer there is that often the cost of altruism is small anyway. It can explain why people vote. Here the expense is small anyway.

Still there seems to be some factors that are even bigger.

Let's take a look at people that die for their ideology. Christian martyrs, Muslim suicide bombers, or Communist guerilla fighters. They seem to get so little and well, die.

And that's pretty common. It seems pretty easy for a leader or pedagogue to rouse men to be soldiers. Of course, becoming a soldier is a pretty shitty job, yet most men don't mind.

These people make a huge sacrifice for the sake of their country, ideology, or people that are not even genetically related to them.

Why?
",J. Chang,https://biology.stackexchange.com/users/554,"Your question is quite broad and asks for explanations for various behaviours which can lead to self-sacrifice. 

Religious reasons: The genetic influence here may be a predisposition to let others influence you. This is what gives rise to culture in the first place, in other words: the predisposition to at some point maybe sacrifice yourself because you are taught to do so can only die out if the basic behaviour which gives rise to culture dies out. Cultures which lead their members to die may decimate their own numbers, but they will not wipe out culture itself because in the bigger scale, those with culture do better than those without. (Plus, those who sacrifice themselves may have children as well, so any genetic influence on their behaviour can be carried on.) This also goes far into the field of memetic evolution, which is disputed but may be interesting to read about.

Political reasons: As in, dying for one's nation or country rather than because of teachings. This probably has a defensive behaviour towards one's own group as the genetic influence. Also, reputation plays a big role: see shigeta's excellent answer.

You also mention willingness to subordinate oneself which is a very common pattern not only in humans. Richard Dawkins touches on this in The Selfish Gene, but there are probably papers more focussed on this particular topic out there as well.

I think it is far-fetched to assume a genetic inheritance of in general ""willingness to die for something"" (which would be required for genetic evolution to work on it).

Is there a way to trigger a time-based (or permanent) ban to an IP address that tries to access ""x.php"" anywhere on my site?

Perhaps I need a custom 404 PHP page that captures the fact that the request was for ""x.php"" and then that triggers the ban? How can I do that?

  persists, then they will be served up

5189,5189,8243,IPython Qt Console doesn't have a title in GNOME app switcher,"  

When I use the app switcher in GNOME 3.16, the IPython Qt Console (version 3.1.0) doesn't have a title under its icon (see image, and compare with Chromium). I also noticed that the icon doesn't have a title in the GNOME dock, nor is it present in the GNOME bar at the top.

I thought that maybe the title would be set in the .desktop file, but then I had a look at my /usr/share/applications/ipython-qtconsole.desktop and it doesn't look any different from other applications (i.e. it has a Name label set to an IPython value).

Is there a way to add a title manually?

I'm on Arch Linux using GNOME 3.16.1.

Gnome Shell uses the WM_CLASS property to associate apps to their "".desktop"" files. Reference

You could create a .desktop file without a name that would temporarily fix your problem but any other app with no WM_CLASS property would mapped to that one too.

1884,1884,2995,Kyoto Cabinet / Berkeley DB : Hash table size limitations,"I am having a hard time storing hundreds of millions of key/value pairs of 16/32bytes with a hash array on my SSD.

With Kyoto Cabinet: When it works fine, it inserts at 70000 record/s. Once it drops, it goes down to 10-500 records/s. With the default settings, the drop happens after around a million records. Looking at the documentation, that is the default number of buckets in the array, so it makes sense. I increased this number to 25 millions and indeed, it works fine until around 25 millions records. Problem is, as soon as I push the number of buckets to 30 millions or over, the insert rate is down to 10-500 records/s from the beginning. Kyoto Cabinet is not designed to increase the number of bucket after the database is created, so I cannot insert more than 25 millions records.

1/ Why would KC's insert rate get very low once the bucket number exceeds 25M ?

With Berkeley DB: The best speed I got is slightly lower than KC, closer to 50000 record/s, but still ok. With the default settings, just like KC, the speed drops suddenly after around a million records. I know BDB is designed to extend gradually its number of buckets. Regardless of that, It tried to increase the initial number, playing with HashNumElements and FillFactor, but any of these attempts made the situation worst. So I still cannot insert over 1-2 millions records with DBD. I tried activating non-synchronized transactions, tried different rates of checkpoints, increased caches. Nothing improves the drop down.

2/ What could cause BDB's insert rate to drop after 1-2 million inserts ?

Note: I'm working with java, and when the speed is dropping, the CPU usage lowers to 0-30% while at 100% when working at correct speed.
Note: Stopping the process and resuming the insertion changes nothing. So I don't think that is related to memory limits or garbage collection.

Thx.
",Kai Elvin,https://stackoverflow.com/users/1767126,"Below is how I managed to store billions of records despite the writing limitations encountered with KC.

With much effort, I still haven't solved the problem for neither Kyoto Cabinet nor Berkeley DB. However I came up with an interesting workaround using Kyoto Cabinet.

I noticed I cannot write more than 25M records on one KC file, but read has no such limitation −it is always fast, regardless of the size of the database. The solution I found is to create a new KC file (a new database) for every 25M new records. That way the reading happens on many KC files and is still fast, and the writing happens only on the last created file and is fast as well. Only remaining problem was to allow update/deletion of the records on the previous files. For that, I copied the SSTables approach, which is :


All the 0 to N-1 files are read-only, file N is read+write.
Any insert/update/deletion is written in file N.
Reads look into files N to 0, and return the first-seen/last-written insertion/update/deletion.
A bloom filter is attached to each file to avoid accessing a file that doesn't have the wanted record.
As soon as file N reaches 25M records, it becomes read-only and file N+1 is created.


Notes :


Just like with SSTables, If a lot of updates/deletions are performed, we might want to perform compaction. However contrary to SSTables, compaction here doesn't require to rewrite the file. Outdated records are simply removed from the KC files, and if a KC file gets very small, it can be either removed −reinserting the records in file N− or reopenned for new insertions −provided the next files are compact.
A deletion does not delete the record, but write a special value that identifies the record as deleted. During compaction, deleted records are removed for real.
Checking if a record exists usually requires to look into the database. Thanks to the bloom filters, most of the negative answers can be given without any disk access.

Use the CodeModuleManager methods getModuleDownloadTimestamp() or getModuleTimestamp() (not sure which one would give the proper information) to look up the ""install time"" of the module, then store it in persistence.

1980,1980,3154,Harvesting parts from slain creatures,"In general: if you kill a monster with a body part that has some known (or suspected) property, is there any mechanic around harvesting the body part and using it as-is (or with minimal processing required)?

Specifically: We're fairly low level and just found ourselves fighting a Dretch. While none of us did very well on our knowledge checks, it became apparent during the fight that it had a fair number of buffs, including DR and elemental resistances.


Which of these are properties of the skin, and which are properties of the creature itself?
Would such properties persist in the skin after removal (and tanning, I assume)?
Would tanning/crafting produce armor, a wondrous item, a trophy, or what?


I read some comments about how his is sort of frowned upon since it disrupts the economics of the game... and, ultimately, I understand this is totally subject to DM's approval, but... just thought knowing how this is handled generally is appreciated.

(I asked another question about repurposing magic items which is somewhat similar to this, but I don't think this is a duplicate, since this is specifically about harvesting nearly-ready-to-use parts of creatures, whereas the other one dealt mainly with using magic items to create new items).
",Patrick87,https://rpg.stackexchange.com/users/8737,"Pathfinder, like its predecessor D&amp;D 3.5, follows careful guidelines regarding the amount of treasure awarded and the value of items with magical properties.

That means while it's up to you as DM to decide what monster body parts are worth and what items can be crafted from them, be aware that you're effectively giving out treasure.


While there are no official rules, it stands to reason that the corpse has the creature's physical properties. A red dragon's hide is still tough and fire resistant even after separated from the dragon. However, magical properties (like a displacer beast's displacement) might degrade over time unless fixed in place with enchantment.
A house rule in our 3.5 games is that the item itself may have some properties of the creature, but the item does not confer these abilities to its wielder. For example, a red dragonhide shield won't protect you from a fireball, but the next adventurer to stumble upon your charred remains will find the shield undamaged. In fact, this rule made its way into Pathfinder's rules on dragonhide armour. While the armour doesn't confer energy resistance, the price to add the energy resistance enchantment is reduced by 25%.
You can craft weapons, armour, trophies and other items from slain creatures. Here's what I suggest:


Weapons/armour: You're essentially just crafting a normal item using the creature's corpse as special materials. Make craft checks as normal, but you don't pay the raw material cost. The GM decides what special properties the material has, if any, what items can be made, and what those items cost (for the purpose of craft duration and sale price). Properties shouldn't normally be as powerful as a permanent magic enhancement (but if they are, the GM should be aware of the treasure value he's awarding every time he uses that creature).
Wondrous items: Mundane crafting isn't enough to create a permanent magic item. You need rituals to fix the magic property in place. At best, a creature's body provides a discount of up to 25% on crafting an item: e.g. a displacer beast hide to make a cloak of displacement.
Spell components: 250gp for powdered horn sounds like a great way to get rich. However, that's the buy price, so you'd sell it at 125gp, and that's after processing: as per the craft skill, raw materials are only worth 1/3 of the finished item. So at best, body parts harvested for spell components are worth a fraction of the part's price.
Trinkets: Preserved monster hearts, heads on plaques and so forth should only be worth a few gp at most. Use the craft skill as a guideline. You can normally make half your craft check per week in gold as a profession anyway, so this isn't out of bounds.



If your players try to carry back every animal part for gold, this will lead to a lot of boring bean-counting and extra gold. Remind players that their carrying capacity is limited and body parts weigh a lot. Have the market saturate and suddenly nobody wants to buy all these grell beaks. Or abstract it away: say ""you sell all the collected monster parts for 50gp"", or you can craft as a profession for double value for two weeks after you have been on an adventure where you collected parts.

  Let $G = (V_1, V_2, E)$ be a bipartite graph on $n$ vertices with $|V_1| = m$ and $|V_2| = n-m$. Assume without loss of generality that $|V_1| \leq |V_2|$ so $m \leq \left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor$. If $G$ is complete bipartite then it has $m(n-m)$ edges since each of the vertices in $V_1$ is connected to each in $V_2$. Thus, the total number of bipartite graphs with parts of size $m$ and $n-m$ is $2^{m(n-m)}$. In order to find the total number of possible bipartite graphs on $n$ vertices we sum over all possible $m$:
  \begin{align}
\sum^{\left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor}_{m=1} 2^{m(n-m)}

2767,2767,4410,"Embedded devices Authentication, Integrity and Confidentiality","Embedded devices send messages to the server. The server occasionally sends messages to individual devices(Reboot, upgrade firmware etc)

After some research this is my ad-hoc solution:

1) Each devices gets a unique id(like MAC address) and a public/private key pair when first programmed at the factory. The server will have a copy of the unique id and the public key for each device.  

2) The server has a public certificate.

3) When the device wants to send a message: If it wants confidentiality it can encrypt the message using symmetric encryption and the key,salt etc will be encrypted with the servers public key. Then it can use it's private key to digitally sign the message which gives the message Authentication and Integrity. 

4) The same process could be reversed when the server wants to send a message to the client. 

5) Timestamps will be part of the message to resist replay attacks. The time needs to be fairly synchronized (within a minute of each other) for data collection purposes. 

Are there any flaws with doing it this way? The devices are fairly resource constrained so have to pick fast public key algorithms.

Use per user or session indirect object references. This prevents attackers from directly targeting unauthorized resources.

Check access. Each use of a direct object reference from an untrusted source must include an access control check to ensure the user is authorized for the requested object. [italics mine]

168,168,265,Why is the pixel count of RAW images from the Panasonic LX5 slightly larger than the generated JPEGs?,"I'm new to working with RAW images, and I'm capturing simultaneous RAW+JPGs with my new Lumix LX5, and using Bibble to view/process the results.

I'm very surprised that the RAW images taken at 24mm wide 16x9 seem to capture a different (and larger) sensor area compared to the JPGs. The RAW images seem to contain the equivalent of about 100 extra pixels on left and right sides, and a smaller number top and bottom. I say ""equivalent"", because the actual pixel counts of RAW and JPG are only slightly different, which implies some resizing must be going on...?

JPG: 3968 x 2232
RAW: 3976 x 2238

I guess this small difference is because JPG images must be 16x16 multiples>

The raw image displays noticeable vignetting in the extra pixels, and there's a fair bit of chromatic aberration. I can crop off the 'extra' pixels, but then my RAW image has fewer pixels in it than the JPG, which doesn't feel right. 

I'll try and add samples shortly.
",Roddy,https://photo.stackexchange.com/users/562,"I think this is happening because Bibble (at least the version you're using) isn't applying the metadata in the LX5's RW2 file that tells it how to correct for the lens' deformations. Perhaps this is a setting in Bibble, or a missing feature in their RW2 converter. I'll bet if you convert your RW2's to DNG with Adobe's free DNG converter, Bibble be able to read and apply that data and produce a 'corrected' image. 

I've come to this conclusion (and found your question) by noticing the same artifacts you mentioned when using Picasa 3.8 to view images created using Adobe DNG Converter 6.4.0.139 from my LX5's RAW files. This happens when I ask Adobe DNG Converter to create files for ""Camera Raw 5.4 and later"", the max setting. This theory was backed up by the fact that the JPG preview looks corrected when compared to the image rendered by Picasa when it renders the DNG. Not only that, but the JPG preview rendered by Adobe DNG converter matches the JPG's that came straight from the camera for the same shot (clearly the converter is applying the same transformations that the camera did internally to make the JPG).

After playing around a bit, I discovered that the artifacts go away in Picasa 3.8 when I have the DNG Converter create files for ""Camera Raw 4.6 and later"". I assume this means Picasa 3.8 doesn't understand Camera Raw 5.4, but it CAN understand Camera Raw 4.6, and will apply the correction automatically to conforming DNG files. No more corner vignette and barrel distortion on the resulting DNG files in Picasa, and in theory all the information from the RW2 is in the DNG!

Also - I wouldn't be put off by the correction - it's a good thing - and supposedly no information is thrown away. The DNG / RW2 files contain the raw sensor data plus additional information on the lens / camera aberrations, and viewing software can elect to apply these transformations or not. The 'true' sensor data can always be accessed.

Are there other examples of cubic graphs that do not admit a perfect matching and, unlike the above example, do not contain a vertex that lies at the intersection of three bridges (i.e. an edge whose removal increases the number of connected components in the graph)?
",Anthony Labarre,https://mathoverflow.net/users/3356,"Substitute your central vertex in your graph with a 3-cycle $abc$ so that the graph stays cubic. Now subdivide each edge in this 3-cycle.

3041,3041,4849,Differences in student load at liberal arts colleges vs. research universities,"Do students at liberal arts universities have 'harder' courses than students at research universities? 

Computer Science curricula at large research universities have 5 to 6 courses per semester. The Liberal Arts model dictates roughly 4 courses per semester. If the load on the student is considered to be equivalent, there must be something special to the teaching in the Liberal Arts model.

How is it that a 4 course Liberal Arts semester is as intensive as a 6 course research university semester?

UPDATE: Many of the comments below say the course load I mention above is inaccurate. I have obtained the figures as follows.


The Liberal Arts Computer Science Consortium (LACS) has released 3 LACS curricula in response to ACM/IEEE CS curriculum recommendations. The first in 1986 in response to the 1978 recommendation, next in 1996 in response to the 1991 recommendation and the most recent in 2007 in response to the 2001 recommendation. The 4 year course breakdown in all the LACS recommendations is roughly the same:

4 courses per semester
30-35% CS courses, 10% math, 5% science, and the rest, i.e. 50% or more courses on arts, humanities and social sciences.

A typical graduation requirement at a research university is at least 120 credits, which comes to 5 3-credit courses per semester. Many require more than 120 so 6 course semesters are not uncommon.

",wsaleem,https://academia.stackexchange.com/users/14572,"As with other commenters, I think the premise here is flawed.

I teach at a public liberal arts college which is typical of many. (Certainly our curriculum and requirements are in line with other schools in the COPLAC Council of Public Liberal Arts Colleges.)

Our students are required to complete 120 credits to graduate, which over four years averages to 15 credits a semester, or five 3-credit courses. I don't believe there is any serious difference in student course load when compared to large research universities (but maybe someone will prove me wrong).

The main distinction about teaching at a liberal arts college is that the overall curriculum is broader, and students do not focus on specialization as much as integration of diverse subject areas. Instead of taking 70 or 80 credits of (say) computer science, our students take only 40-45, with the other two-thirds of their degree consisting of courses in other areas. In this way, students build a broad, integrated perspective which incorporates their major into a study of the world at large. The focus at liberal arts colleges is to help students become better critical thinkers, decision makers, and problem solvers, rather than becoming subject matter experts in a narrow discipline.

Since I've done that, I'm having a hard time getting the camera to focus and take photos in lower light.  I can hear it (and see it) hunting to focus, but the bottom right flashes the image suggesting I use the flash and it won't let me take a picture.

I've ensured that it's set to AF-C, but I'm still not able to force the photo to be taken.  This happens with multiple lenses, including my prime which is fairly decent in low light.  Often the exposure information on the screen shows me that I am close to perfect exposure (and sometimes just a bit underexposed).

What's going on?  Is there something wrong with the camera?  What other settings can I check?

Some other tidbits, I have it set to Manual, and I'm able to take the photos if I manually focus--but that doesn't work for me since my eyesight isn't great.

1268,1268,1998,How to specify which resources to protect with Spring Security OAuth2 provider configuration,"I'm currently implementing a Spring MVC application that is both an OAuth client (in the sense that it consumes data from third party service providers), and an OAuth2 Service Provider (in the sense that it should provide the means for third party oauth clients to consume data from this application from a dedicated REST api). 

While I have no issue with the implementation of the application in its capacity as OAuth client, my OAuth2 service provider configuration is interfering with the applications ability to authenticate with service providers- if I enable the Oauth2 config, it appears to intercept callbacks to the application from third party service providers. Disabling it returns the application back to its normal working state.

I'm assuming that this is because I am not specifying which urls I want to the oauth2 provider to govern exclusively- but I can't see any way of specifying this. 

To simplify the question how do I configure Spring Security OAuth2 provider to manage one url root (e.g. '/restapi/*'), and this url only, with it ignoring all other urls entirely? I've had a look at the resources at the projects homepage, but nothing is jumping out at me... 

This may well be down to how I've defined my security intercept-urls, in which case it may not be an OAuth2 specific question, but how to apply different security schemes to different url schemes. Any advice on how to do that would be great!

4367,4367,6946,How to calculate the size of the image circle at infinity focus?,"How can I determine the diameter of the image circle (i.e. the diagonal size of CCD required to fully utilise a telescope's optics) at near-infinity focus? I have looked around online and found this calculator, but I am more interested in how the figure was calculated than knowing the figure itself. 

Background: I am new to astrophotography and recently bought a Celestron Nexstar 130 SLT telescope with a Barlow lens, T-adaptor and T-ring to connect it with my Nikon D80 to take photographs of the night sky in prime focus. The telescope dimensions are 130mm aperture and 650mm focal length. With the 2x Barlow lens (required to diverge the focus enough to mount the camera outside the optical tube assembly) it effectively becomes a telescope with 1300mm focal length. I can measure a picture of an object with known angular size (e.g. the moon) and use crop factors to establish a ratio, but this method doesn't help me understand how a bigger/newer telescope would fare on the same CCD. 

Edit:
Since this question now has a bounty, I would like to emphasize the real question is How to calculate the size of the image circle at infinity focus?, and not the follow-up question of 
Would the image circle size decrease if I was able to ditch the Barlow lens?
",Jono,https://photo.stackexchange.com/users/13946,"You can think of a lens focused at inifinity as simply a pinhole for the purpose of figuring out what gets projected where.  Consider this simplified diagram of a camera:



The box is the camera, the fat line on the left the image plane (where the sensor or film is), and the small hole at right represents the effective point thru which the lens projects the outside view onto the image plane.  In this drawing, F is the focal length and S is the size of some projection onto the image plane.  From basic high school geometry, the tangent of the view angle is S/F:

&nbsp;&nbsp;tan(Ang) = S/F

Therefore obviously

&nbsp;&nbsp;Ang = arctan(S/F)

Yes, it really is that simple.  You didn't say how big the sensor is in your camera, so I'll use a 35mm frame, which is 36x24mm.  The largest circle it can fit is therefore 24mm in diameter or 12mm in radius.  You say your final effective focal length is 1300mm.  Arctan(12mm/1300mm) = 0.529&deg;.  That was the angle from the center to the edge, so double that to make the total view angle of the largest circle on your sensor, which is 1.06&deg;.

To put this in perspective, the view angle of the moon is about 0.5&deg; (it varies, but this is within its variation).  That means for a 1300mm lens and a ""35mm"" sensor, the moon will fill about half the height of the image.

For a cropped sensor, it would appear bigger.  Actually, the projection of the moon onto the sensor is the same regardless of how big the sensor is, but for a smaller sensor it takes up a proportionately bigger portion of the frame.  This would be reflected in the equations above in that the 12mm value would be smaller, since this was the radius of the largest circle that could fit into the sensor frame.

Also note that the simplified geometry of a camera diagrammed above works for the effective focal length.  This will be the actual focal length when the lens is focused at infinity, but can be different when the lens is focused close, depending on the lens design.  However, you are asking about astrophotography, so the focus will always be at infinity and I won't go into that further.

First, Y86 does not have any efx, egx, and ehx registers, which is why you are getting the invalid lines when you pour the code through YAS.

Second, you make conditional branches by subtracting two registers using the subl instruction and jumping on the condition code set by the Y86 ALU by ways of the jxx instructions.

123,123,194,Running something in a cron environment?,"Cron executes whatever program is sent to it in such a fashion that anything written to STDERR causes either the kernel (or cron I'm unsure) to receive SIGPIPE.

",Evan Carroll,https://unix.stackexchange.com/users/3285,"
  ""How does this functionality work?""


What you are describing is not really functionality, it's dysfunctionality caused by a misconception. It's not cron that sends the SIGPIPE, but it is because of the way you are using it.

By default cron emails the stdout and stderr of a process to the owner of the crontab using sendmail (see man cron; if you don't have an MTA installed, the output is just discarded), unless they are redirected.  To do this, it must wait for the process to complete.  However, if you have backgrounded the process with &amp;:

* * * * * /bin/someprogram &amp;


It won't wait, and if the program now tries to write to stdout or stderr, it will get a SIGPIPE, because the pipe is broken (the read end was closed). [This might also happen to a non-background process on older crons if your MTA is missing and you have a lot of output]

So I am going to guess that you have something like this in your crontab:

* * * * * /bin/someprogram &gt; log.file &amp;


Meaning the stdout is redirected to a file, but the stderr pipe is still broken.  This has led you to the erroneous conclusion that ""cron executes whatever program is sent to it in such a fashion that anything written to STDERR causes ... SIGPIPE"".

You can fix your crontab by either removing the backgrounding &amp; or redirecting stderr too:

* * * * * /bin/someprogram 1&gt;&amp;2&amp;&gt; log.file &amp;


If you want.  WRT duplicating this yourself, as qqx says, just close one end of a pipe and then write to it.

IDE is ""Integrated Device Electronics"" - also known as ""ATA"" or ""ATAPI"" (ATA Peripheral Interface).

SATA is ""Serial ATA"" - the same ATA protocol but serial instead of parallel.

USB is a serial communications bus which can communicate with any number of devices, not just hard drives and other storage devices.  It speaks a completely different protocol to the ATA family.

PCI (and the derivatives PCIe, etc) are much closer to the CPU and generally provides much more direct access to the CPU.

970,970,1536,How to configure ssh tunneling with Putty between two RHEL servers?,"I'm trying to allow ssh access from a remote RHEL server to a local RHEL box via Win/Putty gateway. Basically, I'd like to be able to do 'ssh localhost -p 512' on a remote server so that it would connect to the RHEL server in the local network. The local network is beyond a firewall so I can connect from my Win PC to the remote server with Putty/ssh but not vice verse.

LclSrv----WinXP/Putty-----||-----RmtSrv

So, I've added the following tunneling settings to the current RmtSrv session in Putty (actually I use Kitty but doesn't matter):

R512 LclSrv:22

I expect that this would create a process on the remote server that listens port 512 and transfers the connections to a local network/LclSrv port 22.

After pressing start button, Putty opens a regular ssh terminal session successfully but nothing happens. (options show active port forwarding). I've checked with netstat -l that port 512 is not listening on RmtSrv. ssh on this port returns 'connection refused'. What am I doing wrong? May be there is something in the sshd_config that needs to be changed in order to allow the tunneling? Could it be user privileges on RmtSrv that prevents me from creating tunnels? I have sudo btw.

1366,1366,2149,How does multitasking work,"I am completely clueless about the inner workings of an operating system, but I can more or less guess the approximate behaviour of many functions. One thing that I am not able to figure out, though, is multitasking.

In theory, the operating system manages time, according the CPU for small intervals to the various programs running. But it is not clear how this really works.

Say the operating system wants to start my program. The machine code is loaded somewhere in RAM, starting at a certain address. I guess then a jump should be performed to that address, allowing my code to execute. But in this way, the OS cannot regain control until I jump back.

Basically, I can imagine just two ways of making this work, but neither seems really suitable:


The operating system could read the machine instructions I want to perform and emulate them instead of executing them directly. I am intentionally vague, since I do not know how this would work, but it seems like it would slow down the program considerably.
Alternatively, the operating system could wait until I make a system call. In that moment it regains control and can check how long I have been running and do its timesharing stuff. This may work, but it seems unreliable, as I could make a long calculation which does not involve system calls and hang everything for a while.


So, it seems neither mechanism would work very well. How is multitasking actually performed?
",Andrea,https://programmers.stackexchange.com/users/15072,"It varies from system to system.

In nonpreemptive multitasking systems (such as the original Oberon, or the original Apple Macintosh), the operating system periodically ""polls"" all tasks, giving them an opportunity to do work.  The tasks are expected to play nicely together.  If they just have a little bit of work to do, they do it and return to the OS.  If one task has a BIG chunk to do, it is expected to break it into little pieces, and work one little piece each time it is polled.

Hardware interrupts (disk drive DMA completions, serial port interrupts, what have you) cause interrupt routines to run.  These interrupt routines may in turn notify tasks of work to be done when the task next runs.

In nonpreemptive multitasking systems, the occurrence or non-occurrence of an interrupt does not affect which task is running after the interrupt routine finishes.

In preemptive multitasking systems, it is possible for an interrupt routine to force a scheduling change.  In a traditional round-robin preemptive multitasking system, a periodic timer interrupt does exactly that.  The timer interrupt fires, the timer interrupt routine does some black magic to cause the return-from-interrupt instruction to return to the operating system's preemptive schedule, rather than to the running task, taking the processor away from the current task, and (POSSIBLY) giving it to another task.  If no other task is ready to run at that point, the current task will get the processor again, having only lost some time.

Preemptive multitasking can cause a LOT of troubles.  All of that annoying stuff about mutexes and critical sections and deadly embraces and ... show up when the processor gets taken away from you without warning.  You have to use all those things to tell the operating system that you are in the middle of mixing nitroglycerin and taking the processor away from you right now is likely to result in a large smoking virtual hole in the middle of the server room floor.

5249,5249,8346,C++ new memory allocation fragmentation,"I was trying to look at the behavior of the new allocator and why it doesn't place data contiguously. 

My code:

void memTest()
{
    T * pLast = new T();
    for(int i = 0; i &lt; 20; ++i) {

So I ran this with char, int, ci. Most allocations were a fixed length from the last, sometimes there were odd jumps from one available block to another.

sizeof(char) : 1
Average Jump: 64 bytes

sizeof(int): 4
Average Jump: 16

sizeof(ci): 8 (int has to be placed on a 4 byte align)
Average Jump: 9

4831,4831,7679,How can I speed up the rate at which putty dries?,"We're (slowly) renovating the sash windows in our house and the current window is causing problems. What should have been a quick job (especially at this time of year!) has turned into a marathon because the putty won't dry.

We had to replace a couple of panes of glass (one was cracked and we broke another when using a heat gun to remove the paint) so we knew it would take a little while. On a previous window the putty took over three weeks to dry enough to paint partly because (as we thought) there was too much oil. So this time we rolled the putty on newspaper first to try to remove the excess oil. It seemed to work, but after two weeks the putty is still soft to the touch.

We've tried standing the windows next to a radiator but all that seemed to do was make it softer (which was obviously going to happen in hindsight).

So given that we don't want to reputty the windows what can we do to speed up the drying process.

We've had to seal off the room and cover the window as best we can in the meantime.

I've found this advice on DoItYourself.com which doesn't really help as it says use other materials!

The answers to this post on DIY-Forums are confusing at best and possibly contradictory as one recommends exposing the putty to moisture(!) to speed the drying process.

What Riker says to Troi when she passes largely implies that being a command-level officer requires the right frame of mind more than anything else - something which cannot be taught in school (especially without ending up with people who know what it should be and fake their way through).

In TNG 7x16, Thine Own Self, Beverly Crusher mentions that she had took the test and was promoted to Commander, even though she had previously only been a doctor.
Motivated by the events of TNG 5x05, Disaster, and a class reunion just prior to Thine Own Self, Troi is motivated to do similar - she had previously only been the ship's counsellor, and had been thinking of it since the events of Disaster, where she was unexpectedly thrust into taking command.

530,530,834,Using pstool with beamer,"I would like to use pstool with beamer to create a presentation in pdflatex with figures processed by psfrag. However, as the simple example below shows, the figures are processed using the beamer documentclass, so that they each have a full beamer ""frame"" around them. Is there a way around this?

\documentclass{beamer}

\usepackage{lmodern}
\usepackage{graphicx}

    \end{figure}

I suspect that if it's possible to override the documentclass used by pstool to process the figures, that would be a solution, but I haven't found how to do this.

367,367,580,Why is the pixel count of RAW images from the Panasonic LX5 slightly larger than the generated JPEGs?,"I'm new to working with RAW images, and I'm capturing simultaneous RAW+JPGs with my new Lumix LX5, and using Bibble to view/process the results.

I'm very surprised that the RAW images taken at 24mm wide 16x9 seem to capture a different (and larger) sensor area compared to the JPGs. The RAW images seem to contain the equivalent of about 100 extra pixels on left and right sides, and a smaller number top and bottom. I say ""equivalent"", because the actual pixel counts of RAW and JPG are only slightly different, which implies some resizing must be going on...?

JPG: 3968 x 2232
RAW: 3976 x 2238

I guess this small difference is because JPG images must be 16x16 multiples>

The raw image displays noticeable vignetting in the extra pixels, and there's a fair bit of chromatic aberration. I can crop off the 'extra' pixels, but then my RAW image has fewer pixels in it than the JPG, which doesn't feel right. 

I'll try and add samples shortly.
",Roddy,https://photo.stackexchange.com/users/562,"Firstly there are a couple of general reasons raw and JPEG images differ in size, and raw differs from the actual number of pixels on the sensor:

Whilst JPEG image dimensions don't have to be multiples of 16 (or 8 if not using chroma subsampling) it is more efficient to do so, as it allows you to rotate the images without re-encoding (lossless rotation). So that can account for a small image size difference, as you say.

Even raw image sizes typically differ from the actual number of pixels as most sensors have strips masked pixels (that receive no light) down each side in order to detect banding issues with uneven amplification. Further, the size you see in your raw viewer will differ from the actual raw data as some image processing operations use a form of averaging which doesn't work at extreme edges (because there's no data beyond the image to use when averaging) so they get cropped off when the image is viewed/converted.

Secondly the Panasonic Lumix LX3 and LX5 have a different sensor design to most cameras, which is partially responsible for the difference in coverage between raw and jpeg you are experiencing:

The maximum 16:9 image size is actually wider than the maximum 4:3 image size. You would expect them to be the same width but different heights.

This is because they've made the sensor a bit wider for 16:9, employing a non rectangular design and it's pushing the very edges of the lens image circle, this explains the vignetting and CA you observe with the raw. This diagram shows the irregular design: 



As John Cavan suggests, the JPEG image pipeline is doing some correction, including barrel distortion correction, given that 24mm equiv. is very wide for a compact, and the sensor is pushing to the very edge of the image circle. 

Barrel distortion correction makes straight lines straight again, but will cause the image edges to bend in response. In response to this the correcting transformation enlarges the image slightly and crops to get straight edges again. 

Can you see any differences in the appearance of straight lines between the raw and JPEG? It might be quite subtle but get revealed if you overlay them.

When I first purchased my bike, I knew I needed to lube my chain when i did regular maintenance.  I purchased some White Lightning Self Cleaning Bicycle lube, which suggested to me that I only needed to put that lube on the chain and everything would be fine.  

I recently purchased another brand of lube, and it didn't say anything about self cleaning.  I've read in several places that a degreaser is needed and a cloth and some soap to clean a chain properly, and then lubing takes place afterwards.  

If I buy White Lighting self cleaning lube, do I need to go through the regular chain cleaning steps?  or can i just lube my chain and go?
",meltdownmonk,https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/users/4883,"I've used white lightening and thought it was good. I never use oil based lubes now - they're just too messy and you end up paying double because you need to first buy the oil and then also buy expensive degreaser to wash them off again.

I do get through wax based lubes faster than oil - you have to reapply more often. Compared to the faff of oil based lubes though, it seems worth it.

You do have to still clean your chain and cogs off every so often. How often depends on the weather, distance and type of terrain you've been cycling through. But, it seems like far less mess and time is required than oil based lubes. To clean I soak the chain in a mix of hot water, washing up liquid and something like kitchen/hob surface cleaner.

I think my girlfriend appreciates it too as I make less of a mess when doing any bike maintenance.

I forgot how nasty oil based lubes can be until recently when I stopped on a trail to help a guy with a broken chain. His chain was gunked up nastily. The oily emulsion looked like it held particles of grit in it well, so I'm sure he was grinding through his chain and transmission with it.

When I first bought my bike and I knew I needed to lubricate my chain, I did regular maintenance. I bought some white lightning self-cleaning bicycle lubricating oil, which for me, I just need to put the lubricating oil chain on, everything will be OK.","I've used white lightening and thought it was good. I never use oil based lubes now - they're just too messy and you end up paying double because you need to first buy the oil and then also buy expensive degreaser to wash them off again.

I do get through wax based lubes faster than oil - you have to reapply more often. Compared to the faff of oil based lubes though, it seems worth it.

You do have to still clean your chain and cogs off every so often. How often depends on the weather, distance and type of terrain you've been cycling through. But, it seems like far less mess and time is required than oil based lubes. To clean I soak the chain in a mix of hot water, washing up liquid and something like kitchen/hob surface cleaner.

I think my girlfriend appreciates it too as I make less of a mess when doing any bike maintenance.

I forgot how nasty oil based lubes can be until recently when I stopped on a trail to help a guy with a broken chain. His chain was gunked up nastily. The oily emulsion looked like it held particles of grit in it well, so I'm sure he was grinding through his chain and transmission with it. Also, I gave up trying to wash the stuff completely off my hands after I got home, and ended up with marks that lasted a few days until my body shed a layer of skin.

76,76,119,How to plan for the future when installing a new roof?,"We're hiring a contractor to take off the existing roof, repair/replace any rotted sheathing and rafters, and install a new roof. We've also asked that they add a new plumbing vent stack for a new bathroom we'll add later, a bathroom exhaust vent, a whirlybird to vent the attic, a dryer vent, and supports in case we want to install a roof deck later. 

This is a 4 floor row house with shallow pitch roof in mid-Atlantic US. There's a 6"" to 3' pitched attic area with r30 batts on the ceiling joists. Also have HVAC compressor on roof and unit in attic. 

What else should we think about along these lines? Green roof supports? Solar panel mounts? Additional insulation? What should we prepare for now, or at least consider?
",jlpp,https://diy.stackexchange.com/users/535,"The three things that I ask people to consider when they're replacing a roof is if they're in a wind or hail damage region, and if they're in a region with high solar gain (such as Texas) or an area prone to ice damming (such as New England or the upper midwest.)

If you're in an area that is prone to wind or hail damage (thunderstorms or hurricanes), you might want to look into a more resilient form of roofing material. Stone-coated steel shingles (which look just like standard asphalt shingles) are a great product that will resist most forms of damage that can be dished out. Your insurance may give you a discount on them because they have a longer lifetime. 

If you're in a high solar gain area, look into some of the energy-star rated shingles. They again look just like stone coated asphalt shingles, but they'll help keep your attic cool in the summertime. 

If you're in an area that gets a decent amount of snow, make sure that they install an ice &amp; water barrier around any roof penetrations (like skylights or places where they replace a vent) and along the edge of the roof where you could develop ice damming problems. This material is a sticky membrane that self-sticks to the roof deck and basically keeps water from seeping through at all. Common brand name for this product are ""Grace Ice &amp; Water Shield"" ... I also personally use it in roof valleys, gable crotches, and several other places where water tends to get blown up inside something and you really don't want it to soak through. 

You definitely want to get your insulation up to the max, but that's something that you can do at any time using blown-in insulation. If you are replacing roof decking and have it open, you should make sure that you have plenty of soffit vents and that your soffit vents are baffled properly. (I like the Berger Accuvent, personally...) 

You want to make sure that any damaged or rusted flashing is replaced, and that tar paper is replaced. Look into what kind of tar paper they're using (heavier the weight, the better...), because that's actually your roof. Make sure you know what kind of valleys you're getting. For standard asphalt shingles, I prefer woven valleys, but they're harder to do and therefore are more expensive.

So my question is, do cold-blooded animals generate any heat in their conversion of stored energy (food, fat, etc) into motion?  If they generate heat, why are they cold-blooded?
",Jeff,https://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3031,"As the others have said, animals and insects (and even plants) generate heat through metabolism and can regulate their temperature this way.

2677,2677,4268,What is Cold Iron actually?,"It came up in Dresden Files, but is not limited to that game, you can find the term in DnD as well. I would like to know what it means.

This would imply everything made mostly from Fe is cold iron. Clearly, this is not the case, in every game Cold Iron is something special, the every day sword is not made out of it. 

The Dresden Files rulebook is not very specific about it:


  something that anyone could reasonably get access to, but usually doesn’t carry on them (like cold iron) page 185.


What is cold iron?
How do I create cold iron?
How do I get cold iron?   

To make the question easier to understand, compare Cold Iron to Holy Water. You know how it is different from usual Water, you know how you get it or create it.

However, my doubt is based on the fact that, according to the documentation, JTR does not include a specific attack mode for repeating patterns. JTR, and presumably other brute force tools, can be customized for any arbitrary attack mode. But we can't know how often attackers bother to customize attacks in this way. So then the question becomes mathematical. Please forgive the awkward pseudo mathematical notation. 

T = brute force cracking time

PL = pattern of characters of length L

N = number of times PL is repeated

R(LN) = string of random characters of length (L times N)


Would it be true that

T(PL*N)= T(R(LN))


If true, then a repeating pattern password would not affect brute force cracking time. But is it true?
",Luke Sheppard,https://security.stackexchange.com/users/12057,"The knowledge of the password pattern could give you really speed-up in the brute-force method. If you know, that brute-forcing password is a repeating pattern password, you can reduce the cracking time.

If you know, that the password consists of N the same parts, then, all you have to do is find that part. So to speed the cracking process up, you need to add a few lines into your brute-force function. Let's say that the brute-force algorithm checked if your password is abba. Before you let it go to the another step (checking abbb), you should ""glue"" that try and check passwords like abbaabba, abbaabbaabba and so on.

The desired MSE is application dependent, so there can be no general

increase the filter length to obtain a better match.
There is no straightforward way to change the FIR Wiener filter solution to an IIR solution because the IIR formulation results in a set of nonlinear equations which have no closed-form solution.

1967,1967,3133,Potential Impact of Pass/Fail vs. Letter Grade in Elective Courses,"The current grading system of my university allows graduate students to either receive a letter grade (A through F) or receive a Pass/Fail grade (where A-C is Pass) in any course offered. Each student must indicate his/her grading preference for each course within the first 2 weeks of the term. Most departments have a strict requirement that all ""required"" courses must be taken for a letter grade; however, elective courses can either be taken for a letter grade or Pass/Fail. Many of these elective courses are advanced versions of ""required"" courses, or they might be intermediate to advanced courses in other departments that are still related to one's research area.

When it comes time to apply for postdoc or junior faculty positions, could choosing to take elective courses Pass/Fail negatively impact hiring or funding decisions? For example, suppose a postdoc advertisement states that the position requires knowledge of a technique or area covered in an elective course. Would the fact that an applicant received a ""Pass"" in the course be considered the same as if the grade was instead an A or B? Alternatively, is it better to risk getting a B (or C) in a hard elective course instead of ""playing it safe"" by electing to Pass/Fail the course (where A, B, and C all get the same grade)? Are there any situations where the choice between letter grade vs. Pass/Fail can impact anything negatively or positively?

I've often heard that grades don't matter as much in graduate school compared to things like research output and networking, which may make this question a bit irrelevant. Still, I would be curious what others think.

5451,5451,8652,How do you deal with amends from a client?,"I'm a web designer currently working with a very demanding client.

I presented them with designs back in May and I'm still working through amends with them. They are making changes to everything and although I know amends are to be expected, it's really getting to be frustrating. I'm currently working every evening on the list of new amends they have. Tiny things like ""make this blue"" or ""change the width of this"" or ""make this gap smaller"".

I know amends need to be made and that's fine, but how do you handle when there are just too many? I've counted the comments on inVision and there have been 185 amends on 6 pages of a website design. 

Some of them change, and then change again, and then change again and again. For example they wanted to add a strapline, so I added it, adjusted all the menus to accomodate is across the 6 pages. Then they wanted to change the text, so I changed it and updated it across all 6 documents. Now that it's changed, they want to make the menu smaller so now I have to go back and change the menu again.

I quoted based on time I thought it would take to complete the designs with some time for amends but I've more than tripled the time. I haven't explained to them early enough in the process that amends beyond the normal would cost them more so I'm going to have to swallow the cost this time, but should I lay this out better with future clients?

How do you handle amends? Do you put an estimated time on them at the beginning, and then charge more if they go over this? Or do you do something different?

Can anyone tell me how to improve Indian English Accent or get rid of Indian English Accent. Please tell me how to improve specific pronunciation of alphabets, that can help other understand me clearly.
",raj,https://ell.stackexchange.com/users/4219,"StoneyB's answer is really excellent and I will only add a few words to his keyword imitation.

Imitation includes mimicking. When you learn a foreign language you are playing a part. So listen and watch as much as you can when natives speak. Speaking certain sounds is a complex activity that necessitates to place your phonatory  organs in a particular way (lips, tongue, cheeks...), and it is all the more difficult when wanting to produce sounds that don't exist in your native language. And don't hesitate to exaggerate the mimicking in the first steps of the exercises. I'll take the example of my native language French ; the French often have difficulties saying dental consonants  /θ/ and /ð/, so I used to tell the kids I taught  not to hesitate to stick out their tongues at me when saying it. They loved it of course, but as they became more confident and at ease they would forget the tongue sticking bit but still keep the reflex of not sticking the tip of their tongue on the upper part of their palate, but have it slightly protrude between their upper and lower teeth. 

Obviously one doesn't always have natives at hands that one can imitate. For a motivated adult I'll recommend English Pronunciation/Listening on the website of this Canadian College. It is really very good with videos in which you can see people pronouncing some of the difficult sounds specific to English, and diagrams of the phonatory organs, face and profile, as well as exercises with mp3 recorded files.  

Another useful site with videos and diagrams is on the website of The University of Iowa.

The whole body is used in speaking, not only the phonatory organs. When speaking an English person, a German person or a Chinese person will not make the same body movements. Trying to imitate the hands, torso, head, shoulders, etc. movements will have you fit into the native speaker's shoes, and be more like him and come closer to your imitation of sound producing.

I can understand that passwords are stored as salted hashes in good systems so even if the passwords are discovered on the db you cant use them to login.

Is that pretty much it? 

Before we talk about password reset - in this case a good system cannot remind you of your password as it is not recoverable! It can only reset it for you and again isn't this sent plaintext over the net ??? So why cant that get stolen..

The issue is when the real plain text passwords are known by anyone or any system other than the user then identity is lost.

4929,4929,7848,How are potions made?,"Where does majority of the energy for the magical effect of a potion comes from? 

Does it all comes from the brewer? Or does most of it comes from the ingredients? 

I know JKR said that you have to use magic at some part of the process of brewing (hence no muggle potion brewers) [what about a squib?]

If brewer provides all of the energy then why aren't NEWT students magically exhausted after every potion class? Hermione successfully brewed batch of Polyjuice Potion (a very potent NEWT level potion) in first semester of her second year, and while brewing it was very time-consuming and required a lot of concentration she never showed any signs of exhaustion as far as I remember.

In Chemistry (which potion-making is a clear magical equivalent of), there's a concept of catalyst. A catalyst is a chemical which facilitates a given chemical reaction, without actually being consumed as part of it. Usually a fairly small amount of catalyst is enough to affect the reaction.

It seems to me, based on what small info was provided in the books/interviews, that magic in brewing the potions is strongly equivalent to the catalist in a chemical reaction. It aids the potion-making, but isn't there to provide ""energy"" to it. 

This is confirmed by the fact that you tend to boil your cauldrons in Potions using fire - this is what would have provided the energy.


  ""I suppose you added the porcupine quills before taking the cauldron off the fire?"" (same source).


This pretty much answers your main question - the majority of the energy comes from the fire, as is frequently the case with chemical reactions. But some of it can come from the ingredients themselves when reacting.

As such, it seems unlikely that magic involved in making potions is in need of being especially energy-draining, even if it may be somewhat tricky or complicated.

Explanation


Making diagrams (including function plotting) can be accomplished by using PSTricks (recommended because it is faster and easier to learn yet powerful) or TikZ  or others. The code above is written in PSTricks, you need to load \usepackage{pst-plot}.
To get a tight page, use 

\documentclass[pstricks,border=12pt]{standalone}

Define a canvas on which you draw.

\begin{pspicture}(-4.25,-1.25)(4.25,2.25)
 ... drawing codes go here ...
\end{pspicture}


(-4.25,-1.25) represents the bottom left point of your canvas and (4.25,2.25) is the top right point.
Define the function to plot.

\def\f(#1){sin(2*#1)+0.5}


In this example I chose y=sin(2x)+1/2.
Draw the coordinate axes.

\psaxes[labelFontSize=\scriptscriptstyle,ticksize=-2pt 2pt]{-&gt;}(0,0)(-4,-1)(4,2)[$x$,0][$y$,90]

Plot the graph.

\psplot[linecolor=blue,algebraic]{-\psPi}{\psPi}{\f(x)}

Put a label if necessary.

 \rput[tl](*1 {\f(x)+0.5}){$y=\sin(2x)+\frac{1}{2}$}


In PSTricks, we can specify a point in several ways. (*&lt;x-value&gt; {the value of expression in x for the given x}) is one of them. Thus (*1 {\f(x)+0.5}) mathematically means a point (x,y) where x=1 and y=f(1)+0.5.
Compile the input file with xelatex or the combo sequence latex-dvips-ps2pdf.
Done!

The plotpoints can be used to increase the number of points used to plot the graph. But be wise, the greater its value is, the smoother the plot is but the bigger the file size becomes. For most extreme case, plotpoints=1000 should be more than enough.

In a work place PC has a data acquisition card which is 16 bit and has 16 single ended channels. One of the channels is outputting a constant DC voltage which can be controlled by a user via a program in the PC. 

The output voltage is feeding a VFD. The VFD takes the voltage value and controls the frequency of the AC motor depending on the voltage applied.

There is an isolation amplifier between DAQ analog output and the VFD as in the figure. 
When I measure the analog output of the DAQ and the output of the isolation amplifier with a voltmeter I see the same value.

What might be the reason then for this amplifier?

2540,2540,4046,How do I create a great fantasy villain that inspires the party to rally against them?,"In my early years of GMing it was simple enough to say that the badguys were evil and that was all the justification we needed.  They are attacking the village because they are evil, they are stealing the princess because they are evil, etc.

Over time, my group needs have grown to need more complicated and detailed villains. It is important to consider motives.  What is it that defines them as 'evil' to the party?  In terms of a fantasy setting, what would you consider to be an interesting villain?

What qualities make a villain that inspires your party to rally against him?  What kind of villains have worked for your games in the past?

Example:


  A member of nobility is using trade connections to move valuable pieces of art into another country that is secretly paying him quite well and is framing a member of the party to take the fall.  In addition, someone important to the party member has been taken hostage with a promise of release once they party member takes the blame for the crime.

",Maximillian,https://rpg.stackexchange.com/users/18,"Providing context for your setting. Define enough of your cultures, religions, and society so that there is conflict. This will generate motives for PCs and NPCs alike. 

For example all the gods in my setting hates demons which are considered universally evil. One of the common traits of my ""evil"" gods  are extreme philosophies in dealing with Demons. For example Set believes in absolute order, a rigid hierarchy, blind obedience. Mitra likewise believes in order, hierarchy, and obedience but tempered with virtues like justice and mercy. So this aspect of my campaign setups a three way conflict.

You don't have to be a Tolkien, a M.A.R. Barker (Tekemal) to do this. Just think about the consequences of some of the assumptions you and the rules make about the fantasy setting and write up it in a page or two. 

Then fit your NPCs motivations within that framework and play it out from there. On the flip side give PCs a background embedded in that framework. Make their association with the various elements of the framework beneficial. This give a bigger chance that they will care about the Villain NPC's motives and truly despise him for it.

",raj,https://ell.stackexchange.com/users/4219,"Without hearing you speak it's difficult to say what you should work on. Indian English embraces native speakers of many different languages and dialects, and each brings different problems to English pronunciation.

But in general I&lsquo;m going to guess that the biggest problem your hearers face is not your pronunciation of individual sounds but the tonal contour of your phrases and sentences&mdash;what linguists call &lsquo;prosody&rsquo; or (as in the linked article) &lsquo;supra-segmentals&rsquo;. English listeners tolerate a great deal of variety in the pronunciation of phonemes, but rely very heavily on stress patterns to identify the &lsquo;shape&rsquo; of sentences; and as the article tells you, Indian languages use stress very differently.

To attack this problem I suggest simple imitation. Find recordings of fairly long passages by native speakers of the particular dialect you wish to emulate&mdash;General American or Australian or British Received Pronunciation or Estuary English, or whatever. The recordings should be fairly conversational in tone, not readings from technical or highly &lsquo;literary&rsquo; works; interviews with practised public speakers will do very well, particularly if they are telling stories rather than just giving brief answers to questions. Sit down with the recordings, for twenty or thirty minutes at a time, playing stretches of two or three sentences or so, and try to reproduce exactly what you hear. It will feel very odd and artificial for quite a while, but at some point everything will &lsquo;click&rsquo;: your voice and the recording will have the same lilt and feel.

3588,3588,5730,Is a Photoshop EPS file a vector format?,"If I save my file from Photoshop as a Photoshop EPS is that going to be okay as a vector across the board (ie will it be resizeable in whatever it's opened in)? I know if you open a .psd in Photoshop and resize the image, it holds it's quality, so that's fine, but when people need an EPS file because they might want to print it on the side of a building one day (or whatever) is a Photoshop EPS going to be okay? Or is there something else I need to be doing? 

All my designs are always vectors within Photoshop, so text/shapes/designs done with the pen tool - I just need to know that they'll still be a vector for people who don't have Photoshop and can't open it in there to resize it.
",Willow,https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/users/3494,"To a degree.....

With the exception of Live Type, Photoshop creates vector containers with raster fills. What this means is the edges of shape layers will remain crisp and clear when resized because the shape/vector layer edge is saved as a vector and it is recalculated when resized.

However, what is inside the shape layer is not vector. For example, if you create a shape/vector layer and then apply a pattern overlay, an inner glow, and a drop shadow, all those layer styles are not vector and will not scale infinitely. Layer styles are always raster and are bound by raster limitations.

Live type is vector and will remain vector and scalable when used in a Photoshop file and saved as an EPS. However, at times live type can be converted to outlines in eps files to maintain appearance. When converted to outlines, the type loses it's hinting properties and although it is vector, it may not look ideal at smaller sizes. Type is generally not a problem for anything above 12-14 points though.

As DA01 pointed out, eps is merely a file wrapper. Simply saving as an eps does not mean something is vector. EPS can contain 100% raster content or 100% vector content or a mix of the two. When using Photoshop, you always get a mix of the two if you have type and/or shape/vector layers.

1726,1726,2730,Adjustable sample size in clinical trial,"Most clinical trials I see have a fixed sample size.  In some cases they have prior data that allows estimating the effect size and the variance or distribution of values, and calculate the sample size from that for a certain power.  In other cases it is just a guess.

Why wouldn't people run a clinical trial in which the sample size was determined during the trial?  (for example, by increasing it until the confidence interval narrowed to a certain size specified in advance)  Is there any reason this would not be a valid design?  Are there any examples of trials like that, and any references for designing a trial like that?

That is to say, if a sequential design is used, initial patients are recruited and treated. Part way through the study, the currently collected data gets analyzed. Three possible actions can occur at this point: the data may show a statistically significant result and the study will be stopped because efficacy has been demonstrated, the data many statistically significantly show that there is no strong effect (for example, the upper end of the confidence interval is below some clinically significant threshold) and the study is stopped due to futility or the data is not yet conclusive (i.e. both a clinically significant effect and a clinically insignificant effect are contained in the confidence interval) in which more data will be collected. So you can see that in this case, the sample size is not fixed. 

An important note about this: you can't just run a standard test each time you ""check"" your data, otherwise you are doing multiple comparisons! Because the test statistics at different times should be positively correlated, it's not as big an issue as standard multiple comparison issues, but it still should be addressed for proper inference.

204,204,328,Does this C++ static analysis rule make sense as is?,"I'm implementing some C++ static analysis rules, and one of them prohibits a function from returning a reference or pointer to a reference parameter of the function, i.e. the following are all non-compliant:

int *f(int&amp; x) { return &amp;x; } // #1
const int *g(const int&amp; x) { return &amp;x; } // #2
int&amp; h(int&amp; x) { return x; } // #3
const int&amp; m(const int&amp; x) { return x; } // #4


The justification given for this is that ""It is implementation-defined behaviour whether the reference parameter is a temporary object or a reference to the parameter.""

I'm puzzled by this, however, because stream operators in C++ are written in this way, e.g.

std::ostream&amp; operator&lt;&lt;(std::ostream&amp; os, const X&amp; x) {
    //...
    return os;
}


I think I'm pretty confident that stream operators in C++ do not in general exhibit implementation-defined behaviour, so what's going on?

According to my understanding as it is at present, I would expect #1 and #3 to be well-defined, on the basis that temporaries cannot be bound to non-const references, so int&amp; x refers to a real object that has lifetime beyond the scope of the function, hence returning a pointer or reference to that object is fine. I would expect #2 to be dodgy, because a temporary could have been bound to const int&amp; x, in which case trying to take its address would seem a bad plan. I'm not sure about #4 - my gut feeling is that that's also potentially dodgy, but I'm not sure. In particular, I'm not clear on what would happen in the following case:

const int&amp; m(const int&amp; x) { return x; }
//...
const int&amp; r = m(23);
",Stuart Golodetz,https://stackoverflow.com/users/499449,"In C++11, #2 and #4 can be made safe if there are also rvalue reference overloads. Thus:

const int *get( const int &amp;x ) { return &amp;x; }
const int *get( const int &amp;&amp;x ) { return nullptr; }

void test() {
    const int x = 0;
    const int *p1 = get( x ); // OK; p1 is &amp;x.
    const int *p2 = get( x+42 ); // OK; p2 is nullptr.
}


So although they are dodgy, they do have safe uses if the programmer knows what they are doing. It'd be draconian to forbid this.

(Perhaps safer would be if the const rvalue reference overload was made private, left undefined, or otherwise caused a compile-time or link-time error. This is especially true for the #4 case, where we return a reference but there is nothing good to return a reference to and the language doesn't allow references to null.)

Other than that I'd say, if you are concernced about your mail being marked as spam, consider setting up SPF and DKIM. That helps very much.

  How can I set the processor affinity of a process on Linux?  




Computer CPUs have many cores insde them nowadays.

I have always wondered if there is a way to, when I start a process on the Linux command line, specify which particular core or cores that process might use?

For example, can I start a massive grep task and say ""use ALL of CPU2 for yourself"".

Or could I start a find task and say ""never leave CPU3"".

Or maybe I could start a video decoding task and say ""use whatever is available on CPU1 and CPU2""

OR, is there no way to do this because it is not needed and the OS is doing this kind of stuff intelligently by itself (based on nice levels and general resource usage of the process etc)

4213,4213,6718,Crystal Reports 14.0.2.364 + Oracle 11g Stored Proc + ODBC Connection Error 42000,"I have developed Stored Procedures in Oracle 11g and need to access them through Crystal Reports 14.0.2.364. When I developed the reports, I used a direct Oracle server connection (server address, username/password, SID, port, etc.) and the report worked perfectly. As a limit on our LMS, we're told that we must use ODBC connections instead of a direct Oracle Server connection, but, when I connect the Crystal Report to the Stored Procedure in this manner, I get a persistent Error 42000:[Oracle][ODBC] Syntax Error or Access Violation error.

We have double-checked the drivers and we're up to date. We have verified there are no actual syntax errors in the code. We have verified the username we're logging in as has the correct privileges to run the Oracle Stored Procedure. We've verified that, when supplied with the correct parameters, the Stored Procedure runs.

What I'm seeing that I cannot explain is this. There are 4 input parameters to the report and there are 36 returned columns in the recordset that comes back from the stored procedure. Inside Crystal Reports, when I got to Database &gt; Show SQL Query, I get the following:

{CALL ""SABA_REPORT"".""HDT_CORE_GETDATA_DDS_V110""(NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL,
NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 
NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'STR0115', '4260', NULL, 
'course')}


Which shows the 36 returned columns as INPUT parameters (which it should not) as NULL values and then the 4 input parameters: 'STR0115', '4260', NULL, 'course' which are correctly listed.

So, I think there's a mismatch between the parameters that are being passed to the Stored Procedure and what the Stored Procedure expects, generating the error.

For reference, here's the header of the Stored Procedure:

create or replace PROCEDURE HDT_CORE_GETDATA_DDS_V110
 (
      DataReturn IN OUT HDT_CORE_MAIN_V110.CORE_REC_CURSOR
      , ParamOrgCode IN VARCHAR2 DEFAULT NULL
      , ParamCourseNumber IN VARCHAR2 DEFAULT NULL
      , ParamNameKeyword IN VARCHAR2 DEFAULT NULL
      , ParamReportType IN VARCHAR2 DEFAULT 'course'
 )


The DataReturn SysRefCursor is what contains the 36 returned columns. 

How can this error be cleared? 

Thanks in advance for any insight.

2816,2816,4484,Programming on Raspberry Pi device?,"I am new with raspberry pi. Actually I am coming from Java background. Which programming should I use for raspberry pi tasks? The choices are given below:-


Java

Kindly suggest me which one of them should I choose?
",Zeb,https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/users/10852,"This is largely a matter of opinion; these are two different languages with their own strengths and weaknesses.

That said, the rpi community seems very partial to python, and so you have various python libraries for doing pi (or: linux based GPIO dev board) specific things.  If you are interested in connecting I2C devices from retailers like adafruit, there is often python helper code and corresponding tutorials.

However, you don't actually need python to do any of that.  The I2C interface is a native C API (and very very simple), so if you know C, you could incorporate than into Java via the JNI, which someone else has already done (so if you don't know C, you should be able to use that).

As explained here the GPIO interface uses file nodes and is therefore in fact language agnostic: other than basic I/O, you don't need any additional libraries at all.

So there's nothing you can do in python in the pi that you can't do in java as well.  My personal suggestion, if you don't already know one of the big 3 ""dynamically typed object oriented"" languages -- python, perl, and ruby1 -- is to try one.   Java is great, but dynamic typing is a very interesting contrast and knowing one of those (my own preference is perl) is definitely worthwhile.

1 To be fair PHP should round that out to four, since it can be used in a general purpose way and not just for web-dev.  Javascript fits in with these too, but still isn't used much as a general purpose language and the possibilities for such are more limited.

4219,4219,6730,What lightweight telephoto lens are available for Nikon bodies?,"I'm looking for a lightweight telephoto lens for my Nikon D700 body, with a focal length around 300mm, good sharpness and AF. After several days with the 70-200 vrII handheld, I found this lens too big and heavy. I usually prefer the prime lenses, but all the good ~300mm prime I know weight 1.5kg or more.

I will use it mostly for sport, wildlife and landscape. A bonus point if it is bright enough for a use in dark concert stages :)

The only two lightweight options I considered for now are


Nikon 70-300mm VR (750g, F5.6@300mm)
Nikon 180mm (760g) + 1.4x TC (F4@250mm)


Have you any recommandation on these possibilities ? e.g. with third party lenses.

I think I can call myself ""fluent"" in C#, because I know the language and runtime very well, and I'm very familiar with the .NET framework's APIs and classes, etc.

I would like to claim the same thing for Python and C++.
But while I can program in Python (I did so for an entire summer, making a website with Django), for example, I would not call myself fluent because my code isn't always ""Pythonic"" (e.g. using map/filter vs. list comprehensions), and I'm not too intimate with some aspects of the language and standard library yet (e.g. the introspection API, etc.).

Basically, I'd like to be able to do 'ssh localhost -p 512' on a remote server so that it would connect to the RHEL server in the local network. The local network is beyond a firewall so I can connect from my Win PC to the remote server with Putty/ssh but not vice verse.

LclSrv----WinXP/Putty-----||-----RmtSrv

So, I've added the following tunneling settings to the current RmtSrv session in Putty (actually I use Kitty but doesn't matter):

R512 LclSrv:22

I expect that this would create a process on the remote server that listens port 512 and transfers the connections to a local network/LclSrv port 22.

After pressing start button, Putty opens a regular ssh terminal session successfully but nothing happens. (options show active port forwarding). I've checked with netstat -l that port 512 is not listening on RmtSrv. ssh on this port returns 'connection refused'. What am I doing wrong? May be there is something in the sshd_config that needs to be changed in order to allow the tunneling? Could it be user privileges on RmtSrv that prevents me from creating tunnels? I have sudo btw.

225,225,359,Wrapper classes for objects returned by 3rd party APIs,"I am building a WPF application which uses a third party library to fetch objects which I want to allow the user to interact with.

The objects are returned as interface types. Am I right in thinking it is good practise to create wrapper classes for these objects instead of binding directly to the interface returned e.g (ICustomer)?

If so, what is the best way to do this? My current thinking is to inject the service into my view model. Then create my own version of the customer class (ClientCustomer) on the client. When I call get customers on the service it will return a list of ICustomer. For each of these, I will create a new instance of ClientCustomer passing in the ICustomer object and client customer can simply return the underlying properties. This will leave me with a list of ClientCustomer objects which I can bind to instead of binding directly to the List of ICustomer.

public class ClientCustomer
{
  public ClientCustomer(ICustomer c)
  {
    this.customer = c;
  }

  public string Name
  {
    get { return this.customer.Name;}
  }

  //Other properties in a similar way to Name
}

public class CustomerViewViewModel : ViewModelBase
{
  ICustomerService svc;

  public ViewModel(ICustomerService svc)
  {
    this.svc = svc;
    Customers = new List&lt;ClientCustomer&gt;();
    var custs = svc.GetCustomers();
    custs.ForEach(c =&gt; Customers.Add( new ClientCustomer(c));
  }

 public List&lt;ClientCustomer&gt; Customers {get;}
}


Is this a good approach? I'm also unsure how to handle complex types which ICustomer contains. For instance ICustomer has a List of Bank accounts IBankAccount. Do I need to wrap the Bank Account object in a similar way as well?
",Tiggy,https://codereview.stackexchange.com/users/67042,"You're almost there. You have the right idea, but you missed the execution of the idea a little bit. 


public class ClientCustomer
{
  public ClientCustomer(ICustomer c)
  {
    this.customer = c;
  }

  public string Name



You've put a boundary in between yourself and the third party interface, but then you've turned around and coded against an implementation. We should code against interfaces whenever possible. 

Right now you're probably confused. 


  But I can't code against that interface. I need to insulate myself from it. 


You're right. You do need to insulate yourself from the third party interface. It's their boundary, not yours. You need the Adapter pattern. 

You need to create your own interface that your code will work with. 

interface IClientCustomer
{
    string Name { get; }
}


Then your class implements your interface. 

public class ClientCustomer : IClientCustomer


And all of the client code works with classes implementing the IClientCustomer interface. 

  public ViewModel(ICustomerService svc)
  {
    this.svc = svc;
    Customers = new List&lt;IClientCustomer&gt;();


This way, if you ever swap the libraries out, you're truly insulated. You create a new class that implements your interface and it is much easier to swap one for another. If you make this small change, I'd say you've got it right.

close + no changes => close


The close button will be removed in the near future, but the functionality and behaviour remain as on a desktop you will always have the ""X"" button by which you can close a form. The inclusion of a separate close button was really to provide a bigger target...

Edit

Just for good measure, here is Joel's view on disabling/hiding menu items (which is ""DON'T"") http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2008/07/01.html

I have come to the conclusion that it applies to buttons as well.

In response to JohnGB's comment

The back button in a browser never submits a form, it always has the implicit meaning of a cancel. Any app, whether on a desktop, in a browser or on a mobile, that supports ""back"" navigation should really stick to that unwritten standard. And it doesn't even matter whether you follow an explicit save or an auto-save paradigm. It just means that using an explicit save paradigm you will have to provide a ""save"" button and in an auto-save paradigm ""back"" is just that ""back"".

I would like to claim the same thing for Python and C++.
But while I can program in Python (I did so for an entire summer, making a website with Django), for example, I would not call myself fluent because my code isn't always ""Pythonic"" (e.g. using map/filter vs. list comprehensions), and I'm not too intimate with some aspects of the language and standard library yet (e.g. the introspection API, etc.).

2794,2794,4453,Manually adding 's' to 'http',"I did a Wireshark capture of my login into a drupal-based website. The website does not use https. And so, quite obviously, I was able to capture my username and password in plain text by simply  using the http.request.method==POST filter in Wireshark. 

Then, I tried to access the same web page by manually adding a s to http in the url. Quite naturally, my browser showed this:



Then I went ahead and did my login again, and did the Wireshark capture again. 

To my surprise, I do not have the any captures corresponding to the http.request.method==POST filter. 

So, my questions:


When I am not really using https, why wasn't I able to capture login id and password in plain text?
What effect did manually adding s to http have?

",pnp,https://security.stackexchange.com/users/9778,"Despite what you may think, you actually were using HTTPS.  This is perhaps an over-simplification, but here's more or less what happened:

When you accessed the website with http:// as the protocol in your Address Bar, you effectively told your computer ""Make a request for this webpage, from this server, and send that request to port 80 on the server"".  If the server is configured to allow access via plain HTTP (apparently, it was), the server will respond and your session (unless re-directed) will continue over HTTP.

By changing the protocol to https://, you instead directed your computer to attempt an SSL/TLS handshake via port 443 on the server and then send the HTTP requests through that tunnel.  Obviously, this worked or you would not have been able to access the page.  Since the SSL/TLS connection was successful, that meant that all subsequent HTTP requests sent through that tunnel would be secured from casual eavesdropping (e.g.: via Wireshark).

But now, you ask, what about that nasty red slash through https, and the ""x"" on the lock?  These indicators do not mean that the SSL/TLS connection was unsuccessful, or that your communications to the website are not encrypted.  All these negative indicators mean is that the website is not signed by an authority your browser recognizes.  This is often the case for the web interfaces on SOHO networked equipment, business applications, or websites where the administrator has chosen to use a self-signed certificate instead of purchasing one from a well-recognized authority (e.g.: VeriSign).

This is analogous in some ways to selling alcohol in a jurisdiction where such sales are age-restricted.  Since I don't know all the intricacies of the real-world laws, let's say for the sake of argument that the law only goes so far as to say it is illegal to sell alcohol to a person who is younger than a given age.  What the law in this hypothetical case does not specify is whether you are required to check I.D. prior to a sale, or which forms of I.D. are considered to be valid proofs of age at time of sale.  Authoritative proof of the buyer's age is only ultimately required in court if the legality of the sale is ever challenged.  However, it is still of course a good idea to check I.D.s on every sale just to be safe.

Here, you are a clerk at a convenience store in the great state of Comodo.  Most of your customers will be fellow Comodoans, and so you are naturally able to easily recognize and verify their I.D.s which are issued by the Comodo Government.

One day though, you get a customer from the distant state of VeriSign.  What do you do now?  Fortunately, your store has a book called Trusted Root Certificates which has pictures and tips on how to verify I.D.s issued from various states in your country.  You check your book, compare the customer's I.D. to the relevant photograph and notes, and judge that the I.D. is indeed issued by an authority trusted by your store.  Given this, you can now trust that the information on the I.D. (particularly, stating the customers identity and age) is accurate, and therefore be comfortable in knowing that you are making a legal sale.

On another day, a customer comes in from overseas.  His name is Drupal, and he hails from the land of DigiNotar.  He says he is old enough to buy alcohol, and his DigiNotarian Government I.D. concurs with his statement.  However, your Trusted Root Certificates book does not have any information to help you verify an I.D. from his country.  What do you do here?

Strictly speaking, by the letter of the law in this hypothetical country, your sale would still be legal if your customer is in fact as old as he says he is.  You could choose to assume he is telling the truth and, if he actually is, go on with your life without ever being convicted of any crime related to that action.

But, without any documentation from an authority you recognize, you are still taking the risk that he is not telling the truth.  It's very possible that he is not of the proper age, despite what he and his I.D. may claim.  In this case, the sale will still be completed.  The product will still only be transferred between you and your customer (not immediately available to anyone else, unless your customer chooses to distribute it), but now the problem is that the alcohol has been given to someone who legally should not have it - and you could be in trouble for this.



TL;DR:  As long as your browser shows https:// as the protocol, you can be assured that the data in your communications are secured between your computer and some endpoint.  If there's any warning signs around that https:// area though, that means that the browser does not trust that endpoint to be what it claims to be.  It is then up to you to decide whether you trust the endpoint's claims to identity enough to transfer sensitive data over the connection.

489,489,763,Why IntegerPart[x/(x/2)]=1?,"Consider this code

x = 0.109354682484;
IntegerPart[x/(x/2)]

Why does it give 1 ?

Update:

If we use an undefined variable, IntegerPart[x0/(x0/2)] gives 2. Since Mathematica never gives warnings about this x0, I'm assuming for any x0 it is true.

If we calculate the same integer part using fortran, we get 2 instead of 1.

program main
implicit none

real(8):: x=0.109354682484
real(8):: y=1.4

write(*,*) int(x/(x/2))
write(*,*) nint(x/(x/2))
write(*,*) int(y)

end program main


compiled with ifort -O0 main.f90

output of above fortran code is

       2
       2
       1


according to here, int is a fortran intrinsic function that calculate the integer part.

Is this a bug?

That's goofy! I'm not even using Drupal 6! There wasn't any updated version of this later in the file; this was the only database connection info. It makes sense that this was in here, since it was originally a D6 site that I upgraded, but it's unusual that it worked so long without an updated array of DB connection info. 

So I pasted this in from another D7 install and changed the un/pw accordingly:

$databases = array (

Ok, I showed that $k(x)$ is irreducible since it it a quadratic and has no linear factors.

A field constructed with $k(x)$ would have order $11^2=121$...and so the multiplicative group would have $120$ elements. If $x$ generates this group under multiplication modulo $k(x)$, then I would know that $k(x)$ is primitive. However, I would have to calculate $x^1,x^2,...,x^{120}$ to show this...

I figured that it would be ridiculous for a question like this to result in $k(x)$ being primitive, but what if it were? Would I really have to calculate $x^1,x^2,...,x^{120}$ in order to demonstrate this? Is there a much more efficient way of solving a problem like this?

To speed up checking you can furthermore make the  observation that if $\alpha^{120/p}\neq1$ for all prime factors $p$ of $120$ (s0 $p=2,3$ or $5$), then the order has to be maximal, i.e. $\alpha$ is a primitive element (or $k(x)$ is a primitive polynomial). Of course, it may turn out that $\alpha$ is not primitive, in which case you will see evidence of this at some point.

3387,3387,5399,What is the best way to show the user large amounts of data?,"I am working on an application with a team that has roughly 2 years of data. This data is shown through multiple visualization methods. Part of the application is a settings panel, which lets the user control various things about the application (How much data they see, color schemes, etc.)

In the settings panel, one of the options allows the user to view their data in table format (report style). Because there is about two years worth of data, it's been broken up in to Month and Year increments. If the user wants to export a particular month, they can export that data to a .csv which can then be opened in a third party program like Excel or Calc. This is what it currently looks like with the entire visualization screen:



Close up view:



Even with the data broken up, there is still a substantial amount in each table (probably about 150 rows). This means the user still has to scroll to view the data. My co-workers think this is the best option, however I want to take a different approach.

I personally think that everything in the settings should be something to change the way the data looks or to get some of the data to take somewhere else.

My solution would be to show the user some sample data (maybe 3-4 rows), then give them the option to export as the main function (as opposed to reading it in browser). I think this makes more sense since the user won't have the ability to sort, select, change, etc. like they would in Excel. Mine would look something like this:



It's not perfect, but it should give you a general idea of the look I'm going for. So down to the actual question...

Question

Which scenario makes more sense?


Display this much data to the user in browser (in a settings panel)
Give the user sample data and let them export it and do what they please with it

296,296,477,What are the benefits of owning a physical book?,"I have seen this question about updates of the D&amp;D 4th Edition books, and it got me thinking.
Since I got my Kindle I have not read a single paper novel; they have fewer drawbacks compared to digital copies than rpg rulebooks.


Dead-tree types have some benefits like looking good on a bookshelf, but any ebook reader weighs less with 100 novels than the usual hard-cover book. 
If you want to look for the damage of Ares Alpha, even with a half-decent tablet it takes less than 2 seconds.  
Digital copies do not get worn, they never get unwanted earmarks, but you can bookmark them.
Rulebooks do get updates, and unless you are willing to take a pen to your book, your hard copies will never contain them. The pdfs can be edited and resent to the buyers. 
Even better is the WotC approach with the DDI, you can look up any monster or item or (almost any) rule, in the most recent form, for 3 years at the cost of seven books. 


I think this is the way to go, even considering the horribly slow character builder. Although I must admit good illustration can help build the athmosphere.

So what am I missing? Why are people buying rpg rulebooks in paper format? Why are books even published, I do not need to know if feats are supposed to be on the right page and skills on the left, I just want a list of them, filterable any way I want. 

Is this just a necessary part of earning money? I understand that pdfs are copied illegally, but the Compendium is not. 
",András,https://rpg.stackexchange.com/users/9552,"I own an ebook, and I find it more comfortable linear reading than in physical books. Also, it's very handy when looking for exact words.

But I find flipping the pages looking for something that is not bookmarked or you don't know exactly where it is, (and you don't know what words look for) or doing diagonal reading on several pages much easier in physical books.

One thing that it's not very important to me, but it is to a lot of people is the aesthetic and emotional factors. A good physical book is something pretty that you can have and manipulate on your hands and that looks well on your bookshelf. Also, in time you can be emotionally attached to your manuals (especially if you own only a handful), but is rarer to feel the same to a digital file.

Still, it's probable that if you have a good and fast ebook reader, the advantages of digital formats are more than the disadvantages, but answering your question, these are the benefits of physical books that come to my mind.

It was about to complete but I have to create ripple effect for one of the weapon that I have used.

First question I want to ask is that is it feasible to use ripple effect for such purpose?
Because suddenly fps goes down.

I have created ripple effect for live wallpaper. But I don't know how to create it for normal game activity.

",Siddharth,https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/users/14941,"The ""ripple"" effect you are showing is just a radial sinewave: sin(t), where t is the distance from some center.



Image from here

Doing this kind of deformation in a vertex or pixel shader is easy: just set up the center of the wave as a uniform variable waveCenter, then move every vertex in z (where z is the ""up"" direction) by MAGNITUDE*sin( FREQUENCY*t ), where t is the distance the vertex has from that waveCenter.  FREQUENCY is how fast you want the wave to ripple.  You can even make the wave fade out by dividing MAGNITUDE by the distance from the waveCenter.

","The ""ripple"" effect you are showing is just a radial sinewave: sin(t), where t is the distance from some center.



Image from here

Doing this kind of deformation in a vertex or pixel shader is easy: just set up the center of the wave as a uniform variable waveCenter, then move every vertex in z (where z is the ""up"" direction) by MAGNITUDE*sin( FREQUENCY*t ), where t is the distance the vertex has from that waveCenter.  FREQUENCY is how fast you want the wave to ripple.  You can even make the wave fade out by dividing MAGNITUDE by the distance from the waveCenter.

1864,1864,2962,Order of footnotes with packages afterpage and footnote,"I need to have footnotes in captions of figures and therefore use the afterpage package to keep the footnotes and the figure on the same page (also using package footnote for footnotes in figures). I need to write my PhD thesis in a style that was defined in Word, but I wanted to write in Latex. Word always puts footnotes at the bottom of the page. So basically, I'm forced to put footnotes at the bottom. Others seem to have the same problem (other question, accepted answer puts footnote on bottom of page, but is manual; also for tables that might float and floats in general, where I found the idea with afterpage; also in other places on the web), so I though I might share my progress made so far and get input from others on the issue.

When using floats in an afterpage environment, the ordering of the footnotes at the bottom gets mangled up in some parts of the document. I managed to fix the ordering of the footnotes at the bottom with a dirty hack (see below), but the footnote number of the figure is not always the first footnote number appearing on the page. So I now have basically two questions:


What does my dirty hack do? I just tried some things and somehow it worked, now I'd like to understand why and whether it might have effects on other parts of the document.
How can I get the correct footnote number, i.e. the lowest footnote number on that page, for the footnote of the caption?


My dirty hack (using \patchcmd from etoolbox): 

\usepackage{etoolbox}

\makeatletter
\tracingpatches
\patchcmd{\AP@savetop}{\global\setbox\AP@footins\box\footins}{}{}{}
\patchcmd{\AP@@}{\insert\footins{\unvbox\AP@footins}\fi}{\setbox\footins\vbox{\unvbox\AP@footins}\fi}{}{}
\makeatother


What I get without my dirty hack:


  
  Footnotes on same page as figure
  Footnotes order not correct
  Footnote number of caption not first number on page

If you really want this output style (I can see no good reason for it, a float is by design a distinct object not in the main flow of text on the page, and so having its footnotes in the page just seems wrong) then you need to use non floating figures.

1950,1950,3109,Does the function which sends a right angled triangle to its area produce infinitely many numbers having hardly any prime factors?,"Let $T$ be the set of pythagorean triples, that is, triples of integers (a,b,c) satisfying a2 + b2 = c2. We think of $T$ as the set of right angles triangles with integer lengths. And let $f : T \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}$ be the function $(a,b,c) \mapsto \frac{ab}{12}$ which computes the area of a triangle (divided by 6, which seems to always be a factor for some reason). 

I was wondering: what are the number theoretic propertires of $f$? It seems to produce numbers with few prime factors. What is the reason for this? For instance, $f(3,4,5) = 1$, $f(36,77,85) = 3 * 11 * 7$, and $f(65,72,97)=39*5*2$. Can we put a bound on the number of prime factors in the numbers that $f$ spits out? Or at least, can we give a 'generic' statement such as 'The output of $f$ almost always spits out numbers with less than 8 factors' or something?

This is horrible user experience. What is a good way to make this seem instantaneous (having to host our own mailserver is not an option at this point)? Some way to execute this in the background? Maybe using some type of queuing mechanism?

I'm using the LNAMP stack on a CentOS 5 x64 machine. App is using CodeIgniter.

EDIT:

It seems using a local mailserver to use as a relay is a common solution. But how does one log or track whether or not email was delivered correctly by using this method? 

Sidenote: Some ESPs provide a REST API for email delivery (ours do too). We currently use SMTP and not their REST API.

4873,4873,7753,Differences in meaning when the verb tense changes (headlines),"What is the difference between the examples below?

Then why are headlines written in ways that says: He Kills (shouldn't it be: He Killed)?

For example:

Parliament passes bill

Parliament passed bill

Also

He kills his friend

Please help. 
",user4084,https://ell.stackexchange.com/users/4084,"Why news headlines are written as ""He says ..."" or ""He kills ..."" instead of ""He said ..."" or ""He killed ...""?

That is because news headlines are written in a compressed telegraphic style, also known as Headlinese.

It might be the best for learners to read this writing style differently from ordinary English. This style has its own special rules of grammar. Short forms, contractions, and abbreviations are usually used. The main reason is to save space.

Here are some useful grammar rules for headlines (the examples are all real news headlines):


Headlines often omit articles and the verb to be. 


  Venezuelan opposition leader in custody -- the leader is in custody
  Old London Air Raid Shelter Becomes Vegetable Farm -- no articles
  Husband Finding Peace After A Terrorist Attack -- the husband is finding peace

Most verbs are in the present tenses (as opposed to progressive or perfect forms). The simple present tense is used for both present and past events.


  Heavy snow triggers collapse
  Obama Wants Tougher Fuel Standards For Big Trucks
  Detroit Maps Entire City To Find Bad Buildings

The future is usually expressed as ""to"" followed by a verb.


  Damon Albarn And St. Vincent To Play NPR Music's SXSW Showcase
  Comcast deal to face antitrust hurdles

Auxiliary verbs are usually dropped from passive structures.


  'Trapped' South Africa miners rescued -- the miners were rescued
  Yemen: 12 killed, 14 soldiers captured in clashes with militants -- 12 people were killed and 14 soldiers were captured





To recap, the simple present tense is preferred. And one good reason to avoid the past tense is because the verb to be is often omitted, which makes the passive voice look like the past tense.

So your tentative headlines could be explained or rephrased like these:


  Parliament passes bill -- we prefer the present tense
  
  He kills his friend -- also the present tense is preferred; using the past tense form could hint the passive voice (see below)
  
  He killed last night -- he was killed last night

I dont want to hardcode the URL, User ID and password in the Java Code of the Service Layer so I would like to put them into the applicationContent.xml file but I dont know how to access them from the service layer.

Can someone please help me out with this..  example code would be great.

5336,5336,8477,How can I detect a power outage with a microcontroller?,"I have the following power supply configuration:
AC MAINS -> UPS -> 24V POWER SUPPLY -> 5V VOLTAGE REGULATOR -> PCB (microcontroller).
What's the best solution to detect the power outage on the mains with the microcontroller?
I also need to detect the zero-crossing so that I can control the speed of an AC motor.
",m.Alin,https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/4906,"Since you also need the zero-crossing you'll get the power outage detection virtually for free.
Best is to use an optocoupler to detect zero-crossings. Put the mains voltage via high resistance resistors to the input of the optocoupler. Vishay's SFH6206 has two LEDs in anti-parallel, so it works over the full cycle of the mains voltage.  



If the input voltage is high enough the output transistor is switched on, and the collector is at a low level. Around the zero crossing, however, the input voltage is too low to activate the output transistor and its collector will be pulled high. So you get a positive pulse at every zero crossing. The pulse width depends on the LEDs' current. Never mind if it's more than 10% duty cycle (1ms at 50Hz). It will be symmetrical about the actual zero-crossing, so the exact point is in the middle of the pulse.   

To detect power outages you (re)start a timer on every zero-crossing, with a timeout at 2.5 half cycles. Best practice is to let the pulse generate an interrupt. As long as the power is present the timer will be restarted every half cycle and never time out. Upon a power outage however, it will timeout after a bit longer than a cycle, and you can take the appropriate action. (The timeout value is longer than 2 half cycles, so that a spike on 1 zero-crossing causing a missed pulse won't give you a false warning.)
If you create a software timer it won't cost you anything, but you can also use a retriggerable monostable multivibrator (MMV), for instance with an LM555.  

note: depending on your mains voltage and the resistor type you may need to place two resistors in series for the optocoupler, because the high voltage may cause a single resistor to breakdown. For 230V AC I've used three 1206 resistors in series for this.  



Q &amp; A time! (from comments, this is extra, in case you want more)  

Q: And the input LEDs of the optocoupler will work at 230V? The datasheet states that the forward voltage is 1.65V.
A: Like for a common diode the voltage over a LED is more or less constant, no matter what your supply voltage is. The mandatory series resistor will take the voltage difference between power supply and LED voltage. The answers to this question explain how to calculate the resistor's value. Extreme example: a 10 000V power supply for a 2V LED. Voltage over the resistor: 10 000V - 2V = 9 998V. You want 20mA? Then the resistor is \$\frac{9 998V}{20mA}\$ = 499.9k\$\Omega\$. That's 500k, that's even reasonable. Yet, you can't use an ordinary resistor here. Why not? Firstly, a common 1/4W PTH resistor is rated at 250V, and will definitely breakdown at 10 000V, so you'll have to use 40 resistors in series to distribute the high voltage. Secondly, and worse, the power that the resistor would have to dissipate is \$P = V \times I = 9 998V \times 20mA = 199.96W\$, a lot more than the rated 1/4W. So to cope with the power we'll even need 800 resistors. OK, 10kV is extreme, but the example shows that you can use any voltage for a LED, so 230V is also possible. It's just a matter of using enough and the right type of resistors.  

Q: How does the reverse voltage affect the lifetime of the LEDs?
A: The second, anti-parallel LED takes care of that by ensuring that the reverse voltage over the other LED can't become higher than its own forward voltage. And that's a good thing, because a reverse voltage of 325V\$_P\$ would kill any LED (most likely explode), just like any signal diode, by the way. The best way to protect it is a diode in anti-parallel.  

Q: Won't the resistors dissipate a lot of heat?
A: Well, let's see. If we assume 1mA through the resistors and ignore the LED voltage, we have \$P = V \times I = 230V_{RMS} \times 1mA = 230mW\$, so even a 1206 can handle that. And remember, we're using more than 1 resistor, so we're safe if we can work with 1mA (The SFH6206 has a high CTR \$-\$ Current Transfer Ratio).

But if I run the exact same $filter query directly on the OData service I get the results I am looking for. Only when I go through SharePoints ECT and use any of the date functions in the $filter to I get an error.

Is this a bug in SharePoint 2013?

Also, I noticed that if I filter with a startsWith in the $filter its not returning all the matches.  Is there a row limit that it searches.  So if I have a startswith that should return 2 records but the second record is at the end of the list (say at the 1500th place) it doesnt seem to return it.

3281,3281,5228,How much did the 'The Evil Queen' rule in OUAT?,"In Once Upon a Time when Regina became queen, how much did she rule over? Was it only the entirety of the Enchanted Forest?

How long/far did her power extend to? Did she own every single part of land in the Kingdom?
",Izumi-reiLuLu,https://scifi.stackexchange.com/users/20797,"Much like the fairy tales they are based on, the show has been very vague about exactly what Regina was ""queen"" over when she was the Evil Queen. However, I think it was less than your questions imply, because we've seen more than one king/queen ruling within the bounds of the Enchanted Forest:


Regina married Snow White's father, King Leopold.
David (Charming) is the adoptive son of King George.
David also has to do a favor for King Midas
Maleficent was nomimally the Queen of her own kingdom.
Princess Aurora was presumably the daughter of yet another King/Queen.


So, legally, I suspect Regina was ""only"" the Queen of one of several kingdoms in the Enchanted Forest, though the boundaries of that kingdom are never spelled out.

However, Regina was also one of the most powerful rulers in the Enchanted Forest, in particular because of the powerful magic that she possessed. Thus, I assume that once she became The Evil Queen, she would have started to enforce her will beyond it's normal borders. We can sort-of imply this by the fact that no one ever mentions going to other Kings for help with Regina, e.g. Charming never even considers asking his father for help with Regina. In fact, other than flashbacks, we don't see much of anything out of the other rules of the Enchanted Forest (except possibly Maleficent, who appeared to still be ruling over her kingdom when Charming encounters her.)

As far as how much of the land in her kingdom did she own, that's a bit of a tricky question that relates to medieval politics and ownership laws. Generally speaking, if her kingdom were modeled after a typical feudal society (as evidenced by the existence of titular knights), all of the land would have initially been owned by the king/queen, but would have been given to various lords as rewards for their fealty. Those lords would typically own the land and lease it to peasants and other working-class citizens in exchange for taxes or tithes.

How much did she rule? Just the whole magic forest?","Much like the fairy tales they are based on, the show has been very vague about exactly what Regina was ""queen"" over when she was the Evil Queen. However, I think it was less than your questions imply, because we've seen more than one king/queen ruling within the bounds of the Enchanted Forest:


Regina married Snow White's father, King Leopold.
David (Charming) is the adoptive son of King George.
David also has to do a favor for King Midas
Maleficent was nomimally the Queen of her own kingdom.
Princess Aurora was presumably the daughter of yet another King/Queen.


So, legally, I suspect Regina was ""only"" the Queen of one of several kingdoms in the Enchanted Forest, though the boundaries of that kingdom are never spelled out.

However, Regina was also one of the most powerful rulers in the Enchanted Forest, in particular because of the powerful magic that she possessed. Thus, I assume that once she became The Evil Queen, she would have started to enforce her will beyond it's normal borders. We can sort-of imply this by the fact that no one ever mentions going to other Kings for help with Regina, e.g. Charming never even considers asking his father for help with Regina. In fact, other than flashbacks, we don't see much of anything out of the other rules of the Enchanted Forest (except possibly Maleficent, who appeared to still be ruling over her kingdom when Charming encounters her.)

As far as how much of the land in her kingdom did she own, that's a bit of a tricky question that relates to medieval politics and ownership laws. Generally speaking, if her kingdom were modeled after a typical feudal society (as evidenced by the existence of titular knights), all of the land would have initially been owned by the king/queen, but would have been given to various lords as rewards for their fealty. Those lords would typically own the land and lease it to peasants and other working-class citizens in exchange for taxes or tithes. Exactly how much ownership transferred and what rights the king/queen still had over the land would depends on the specific laws of the country.

But again, in practice, if the king decided he wanted to reclaim ownership of some plot of land in his kingdom, no one would really stop him. Given Regina's strength, that goes even moreso for her.

Don't want to change the server doc? That's okay, but conceptually a chat join isn't a chat message. So you should definitely have a meta field for stuff like this in your chat documents.

But supposing you don't want to do that. I'd do something like this:

var userIdToName = function(userId) {...}; // some kind of userId to name helper

Template.chatroom.msg = function() {
  var messages = Chat.findOne(Session.get(""currentChat"")).messages; // msg in your code?
  return _.reduce(messages,function (newMessages, currentMessage) {
    var lastMsg = newMessages[newMessages.length-1];
    if (currentMessage.type == MESSAGE_TYPES_JOIN) {
       if (lastMsg &amp;&amp; lastMsg.type == MESSAGE_TYPES_JOIN &amp;&amp; currentMessage.user == lastMsg.user) {
          currentMessage.timesJoined = lastMsg.timesJoined+1;
          newMessages.shift();
       } else {
          currentMessage.timesJoined = 1;
       }
       currentMessage.chatMsg = userIdToName(lastMsg.user) + "" joins the chat &amp;mult;"" + currentMessage.timesJoined.toString();
    }
    return newMessages.concat(currentMessage);
  },[]);
}


This is a bit of a doozy. Suffice it to say, it ""reduces"" all the join messages it finds in the chat's current messages down to one message. You dynamically add the property timesJoined; it does not appear in the document. But you should have a type field that lets you know the difference between a join message and a regular message is.

If you don't even have that metadata at minimum, then your chat application isn't going to work very well. Don't hesitate to change your model!

  Programmatically Create XML File From XSD  
  XML instance generation from XML schema (xsd)
  How to generate sample XML documents from their DTD or XSD?
  




Here's the scenario: I've created an application that hooks into a commercial CRM product using their web service API, which unfortunately has a different schema for every installation, based on how the users create their custom fields. This schema can also be modified at any time. This application will be installed at the customer location, and will need to function even when they change their field structure.

In order to insert or update a record, I first call their Project.GetSchema() method, which returns the XSD file based on the current set of fields, and then I can call the Project.AddProject() method, passing in an XML file containing the project data.

My question is: What's the best way to generate the XML from the XSD file at runtime? I need to be able to check for the existence of fields, and fill them out only if they exist (for instance, if the customer deleted or renamed some fields). 

I really don't want to have the application attempting to recompile classes on the fly using xsd.exe. There simply must be a better way.

[update] My current solution, that I'm working on, is to basically parse out the XSD file myself, since the majority of the schema is going to be the same for each installation. It's just an ugly solution, and I was hoping there was a better way. The biggest problem I have is that their schema uses xsd:sequence, so putting things in a different order always breaks validation.

3481,3481,5557,Mazda Air Mass Meter - where can I buy one?,"I have a 1993 Mazda 323 estate (GLXI 1.6l petrol).
It's not been terribly reliable and has suffered from inconsistent idle - sometimes idling fast (~1500 rpm) and sometimes erratically and sometimes cutting out when stopped at lights.
The last mechanic I took it to said it was probably a problem with the air mass meter - he did some 'bodges' on it to try and get it working but the car has still failed to start on one occasion. It seems to start and drive ok at the moment, but I'm not sure how much longer it will continue to do so!

Is this likely a problem with the air mass meter or is it likely to be something else?

Also, does anyone know where I could get hold of a new one? (I'm based in the UK)

How have the rules regarding sneaking around changed from Dungeons and Dragons 3.5 to Pathfinder?
",KRyan,https://rpg.stackexchange.com/users/4563,"Skill Consolidation

Hide and Move Silently are now one skill, Stealth. A nice perk for rogues; a nicer perk for those who don&rsquo;t have 8+Int skill points and still want to be sneaky. Also very nice that it&rsquo;s only one roll: less chance of rolling very low and messing up your attempt to sneak. Or, if you do roll high, you don&rsquo;t have to worry about having a mediocre roll on the other.

On the flip side, Spot and Listen have also been consolidated into one skill, Perception. This is still to your benefit when you&rsquo;re sneaking, though, since it means those trying to find you only get to roll one check; there&rsquo;s less chance of an abnormally high roll.

Changes to the effect of Hiding

In 3.5, the effect of hiding was left vague until Rules Compendium. Thankfully, Rules Compendium clarified some things, including the fact that those who fail their Spot check treat you the same way they treat invisible creatures, which means they are flat-footed with respect to you. This is important because that&rsquo;s one of the conditions that qualifies for Sneak Attack.

In Pathfinder, not so much: a successful Stealth check gets you Concealment. In most cases, this is basically useless because you usually need Concealment to use Stealth in the first place. That is, Stealth is often literally giving you what you already had. You can use Stealth with Cover instead of Concealment, in which case you get both, but Cover is much more difficult to manufacture, which makes it much less reliable.

With Hide in Plain Sight, you can give yourself Concealment when you wouldn&rsquo;t have had it. That&rsquo;s nice, but the costs of getting Hide in Plain Sight are very high, and Concealment just isn&rsquo;t that good. All Concealment does is give attackers a 20% chance to miss you. It does not improve your attack or damage in any way. Notably, Concealment is insufficient to trigger Sneak Attack.

Changes to triggering Sneak Attack

On the plus side, constructs, plants, and undead are no longer immune to Sneak Attack. Elementals and oozes still are, as are the new proteans, and things with the incorporeal subtype are immune unless you have Ghost Touch. The 3.5 rogue could overcome these limitations, but it was tricky (required particular wands or feats or ACFs, and often still only did half damage), so this is good.

The good news ends there. As stated, Stealth cannot trigger Sneak Attack. Nor can grease in most cases (and the rules are ambiguous about the cases where it would work), and the blink spell is right-out. Alchemical weapons no longer work either, which is a shame for low-level rogues. Marbles no longer exist. That means a lot of the ways for a solo rogue to generate the conditions required to get Sneak Attack are gone.

As such, you are either going to have to ignore the &ldquo;Sneak&rdquo; aspect of Sneak Attack entirely (and just use Flanking to trigger it), or you&rsquo;re going to need magic, preferably greater invisibility. Rogues get Use Magic Device, but that&rsquo;s an expensive wand.

I've seen on youtube a long-time mechanic who uses a cigar as a cheap alternative to a smoke test machine.  But I'm not sure if something like that could be used if you have no idea where the leak is coming from.

So I ask those who are far, far more experienced than me.  What ares some methods I can use if I have a vacuum leak, but I literally don't have a clue where it could be?

Thank you.

That book would not use the /ɔ/ and /ʌ/ sounds, but when I look in my American English Dictionary for some words, such as more, door, and love, they are reported to be pronounced /mɔr/, /dɔr/, and /lʌv/.
How should I pronounce these words, if there are no /ɔ/and /ʌ/ sounds?  Should they be /mɑr/, /dɑr/, and /ləv/?
Can /ɑ/ sound replace /ɔ/, and /ə/ replace /ʌ/ in every word?

",Kas,https://english.stackexchange.com/users/10792,"The /ɔ/ as described by Wikipedia is an unelisioned ""aw"" sound, as in the pure Latin vowel ""o"" for those singers out there.

In most American English dialects/accents, the mouth is held in a more open, relaxed position while speaking than for most British accents. This can tend to make ""aw"" sound more like more like ""ah"", and ""ah"" like an open short ""a"" as in ""bat"". Similarly, the opening of the lips leads to closing off the back of the throat to provide nuances between vowels, which can make ""uh"" sound like ""ugh"", ""oo"" sound like ""eu"", etc. Vocal coaches tear their hair out over this natural accent, especially in the deep South and Texas, where the ""twang"" pollutes the ""pure"" Latin vowels normally desired for singing in almost any language.

However, I doubt you will find an English dialect where a particular vowel shape is never heard. First of all, there will always be a word in the language that even a heavily-accented speaker will pronounce using the shape you're looking for. It may be misplaced, but it'll be there.

ADDITIONAL INFO

I've recently noticed that when this ""running water"" sound occurs that it is more prominent when the engine is running faster (e.g. during acceleration).  This leads me to believe maybe this has something to do with the water pump, or some other liquid pump, that is run by the engine and not moving enough liquid to fill the pipe, hence a sloshing / running water sound.

However, I still heard the shaking behind the sprint. Does anyone know what this might be? Thank you.","some cars have a grille just forward of your w/screen.If so remove to access drain

132,132,211,How best can I discover what is up with my electrical bill?,"This might be subjective, I don't know. However, it's a serious problem for me. My electrical bill is outrageous. It's three times as large as my next-door neighbor, and four or five times the size of my neighbor's across the street. It's worse in the summer (I live in central TX), but I've had the air conditioner inspected, and while the house is right at the maximum capacity for our unit, the unit should still be able to take care of the load. That also doesn't explain why our winter bills are larger than the comparables.

What I would like to do is check the amount of current drawn by each running appliance and calculate where all my money is going. I just don't know how to go about doing this.
",moswald,https://diy.stackexchange.com/users/168,"You could invest in a clamp on Ammeter like this



Then open up your electrical panel and measure the draw on each circuit, this will show you which circuits are drawing the most.

Also as Mike Powell pointed out, you could clamp on to the main lines and then turn off each breaker noting how much the value drops. (You will have to do this for each leg of the main). 

Once you know which circuits are drawing the most power, you can start eliminating devices on that circuit until you find the largest consumers. 

If you want you can figure out how much your devices cost to run like this.

 Watts = Amps * Volts
 Kilowatts = Watts/1000
 Kilowatt-hours = kilowatts * Hours used
 Cost = kilowatt-hours * cost per kilowatt-hour


Or

 Cost = (((Amps * Volts)/1000) * Hours Used) * Cost per Kilowatt


You could also do like I did and split an old extension cord (so you can clamp on to a single wire), then plug one end into the wall, and your device into the other end. Then you can measure the draw of just that device.

But with it I cannot tell if there is an operation made for a file like a particular file has been renamed or deleted as since if I rename a file fro abc to xyz. If I get a response then I will look for the changes related to the file xyz which I will not find in my existing database so logically I will be making the events as deleted abc and added xyz, where as the reality is renamed abc to xyz.

1203,1203,1892,How to easily determine the results distribution for multiple dice?,"I want to calculate the probability distribution for the total of a combination of dice. 

I remember that the probability of is the number of combinations that total that number over the total number of combinations (assuming the dice have a uniform distribution). 

What are the formulas for


The number of combinations total
The number of combinations that total a certain number

",C. Ross,https://stats.stackexchange.com/users/1456,"Exact solutions

The number of combinations in $n$ throws is of course $6^n$.

These calculations are most readily done using the probability generating function for one die,

$$p(x) = x + x^2 + x^3 + x^4 + x^5 + x^6 = x \frac{1-x^6}{1-x}.$$

(Actually this is $6$ times the pgf--I'll take care of the factor of $6$ at the end.)

The pgf for $n$ rolls is $p(x)^n$.  We can calculate this fairly directly--it's not a closed form but it's a useful one--using the Binomial Theorem:

$$p(x)^n = x^n (1 - x^6)^n (1 - x)^{-n}$$

$$= x^n (\sum_{k=0}^{n} {n \choose k} (-1)^k x^{6k} )( \sum_{j=0}^{\infty} {-n \choose j} (-1)^j x^j).$$

The number of ways to obtain a sum equal to $m$ on the dice is the coefficient of $x^m$ in this product, which we can isolate as

$$\sum_{6k + j = m - n} {n \choose k}{-n \choose j}(-1)^{k+j}.$$

The sum is over all nonnegative $k$ and $j$ for which $6k + j = m - n$; it therefore is finite and has only about $(m-n)/6$ terms.  For example, the number of ways to total $m = 14$ in $n = 3$ throws is a sum of just two terms, because $11 = 14-3$ can be written only as $6 \cdot 0 + 11$ and $6 \cdot 1 + 5$:

$$-{3 \choose 0} {-3 \choose 11} + {3 \choose 1}{-3 \choose 5}$$

$$= 1 \frac{(-3)(-4)\cdots(-13)}{11!} + 3 \frac{(-3)(-4)\cdots(-7)}{5!}$$

$$= \frac{1}{2} 12 \cdot 13 - \frac{3}{2} 6 \cdot 7 = 15.$$

(You can also be clever and note that the answer will be the same for $m = 7$ by the symmetry 1 &lt;--> 6, 2 &lt;--> 5, and 3 &lt;--> 4 and there's only one way to expand $7 - 3$ as $6 k + j$; namely, with $k = 0$ and $j = 4$, giving

$$ {3 \choose 0}{-3 \choose 4} = 15 \text{.)}$$

The probability therefore equals $15/6^3$ = $5/36$, about 14%.

By the time this gets painful, the Central Limit Theorem provides good approximations (at least to the central terms where $m$ is between $\frac{7 n}{2} - 3 \sqrt{n}$ and $\frac{7 n}{2} + 3 \sqrt{n}$: on a relative basis, the approximations it affords for the tail values get worse and worse as $n$ grows large).

I see that this formula is given in the Wikipedia article Srikant references but no justification is supplied nor are examples given.  If perchance this approach looks too abstract, fire up your favorite computer algebra system and ask it to expand the $n^{\text{th}}$ power of $x + x^2 + \cdots + x^6$: you can read the whole set of values right off.

This selector works for regular checkbox's, but for this, its not working, its just showing the unchecked state even if I click it.

Also, how can I put some space between the text and the checkbox?

",raj,https://ell.stackexchange.com/users/4219,"The two main problems in following Indian speakers of English are a) the sounds t, d, and r, and b) aspiration.
For t and d - these need to be pronounced using the tongue against the alveolar ridge, just slightly back from the teeth. It's important not to touch the teeth when pronouncing these sounds. The r is pronounced with the tongue pulled slightly back from the alveolar ridge. Never pronounce any of these sounds with the tongue against the hard palate.
The sounds p, t, k (including hard c) should be slightly aspirated - if you hold a piece of thin paper in front of your mouth it should move when you say these sounds. The aspiration is probably the biggest issue in being intelligible.

2085,2085,3321,Programmatically and efficiently create a graphical ripple effect?,"I was developing tower of defence game for a long time.
It was about to complete but I have to create ripple effect for one of the weapon that I have used.

First question I want to ask is that is it feasible to use ripple effect for such purpose?
Because suddenly fps goes down.

I have created ripple effect for live wallpaper. But I don't know how to create it for normal game activity.

I was not able to understand many things from it. If any one has some knowledge on this then please provide.

Edit :
I include the image for ripple effect that I think I have to use for weapon fire.

Also I include code that I use to create ripple effect. Similar code with some changes I used to create live wallpaper and it work perfectly. But in normal game activity I don't able to find my mistake. So please guide on this

No match: a new user is created and logged in (no problem).

A match:  I want to log the user on.  The problem is that I have the hashed password and I cannot use MembershipService.ValidateUser(logOn.UserName, logOn.Password) to log the user on.

If I just use FormsAuthentication.SetAuthCookie, the user doesn't appear as logged in.

I could set enablePasswordRetrieval to true in the web config and then just get the actual password, but I don't want to.  I want this to be secure.

Does anyone know a way to log a user onto ASP.NET Membership just using the user name?  I have looked at the MembershipProvider class for alternative methods but I cant find any.

As for user16885, I suspect that you said something in the interview that indicated you would be doing ""employment"".  If you have a transcript (which you don't, because there is no appeal from a State Department decision on things like this) I could probably pick it out.

6036,6036,9580,"In Alien Frontiers, how does Raider's Outpost work after a ship has been teleported to another Orbital Facility?","Scenario setup:


A player uses the Raider's Outpost by docking a 3-4-5 set of ships.
Same player uses an Orbital Teleporter to move the 5 ship to another Orbital Facility.


Do the 3 and 4 ships remain in the same position after the 5 is moved, or do they shift? What if the 3 or 4 were moved instead?

A higher value set of ships is required to use the Raider's Outpost when it is occupied. If the 5 ship had not been teleported, a 4-5-6 set would be required. However since the 5 ship has been moved, it's not clear what is now required to use the Raider's Outpost. Since it only has the 3-4 ships remaining, is a 3-4-5 set sufficient? Or is it played as if the 5 ship were still there, meaning a 4-5-6 set is required?
",Todd,https://boardgames.stackexchange.com/users/159,"Actually, there has been official errata posted on this very question:


  Bumping Ships from The Raiders' Outpost
  
  A question has been raised about how the ""Bump Rule"" works for the Raiders' Outpost if one or more ships in the original run have been removed, either by the Plasma Cannon, the Orbital Teleporter, or by losing control of the Relic Ship. Does the new run have to be bigger than the original run or just bigger than the ship that are left over?
  
  Here is the text from the rulebook...
  
  Raiders’ Outpost
  
  You must dock a set of three sequentially numbered ships to use the Raiders’ Outpost. There are docking ports for one set of three ships. If the Raiders’ Outpost is occupied, you may dock a higher-value sequence here and move the original ships to the Maintenance Bay.
  
  While docked at the Raiders’ Outpost you may steal a total of four resources from any mix of players or one alien tech card of your choice from one player. If you steal an alien tech card that you already have, the stolen card is discarded immediately and you gain no benefit from doing so.
  
  Example : If a 1-2-3 is docked at the Raiders’ Outpost and the next player rolls a 2-3-4 then that player may remove the 1-2-3 and dock their 2-3-4 at the facility to conduct their own raid. If another player rolls a 3-4-5 or a 4-5-6 then they may remove the 2-3-4 and dock their own sequence and conduct their own raid.


The addition of a second example should clear up this question.


  Example 2: RED has docked a 3-4-5 at the Raiders' Outpost. On his turn GREEN uses the Plasma Cannon to send the 5 back to the Maintenance Bay, leaving a 3 and 4 on the Raiders' Outpost. To dock a higher-value sequence at the Raiders' Outpost GREEN must use a run of three ships that totals more than the sum of the ships currently docked there. The remaining ships total 7 so GREEN may not dock a 1-2-3 since they only total 6. GREEN may dock a 2-3-4 (total 9), a 3-4-5 (total 12) or a 4-5-6 (total 15) to use the Raiders' Outpost.

2551,2551,4062,How to identify if sentence is passive Voice or Indicative sentence?,"Examples: 


  ""One car was parked outside of the gate."" 
  ""Your work volume is increased or not""
  ""He was arrested""
  ""She was raped""
  ""After accident he was taken to hospital""
  ""He was informed about this""
  “My heart was broken”


All above statements can be in the stative form if we do not mentioned the agent.
But if we use the agent i.e. By Driver, By Boss,  By Police, By  boyfriend, By  friend, By  father, By  husband respectively, then sentence become as passive voice.

My questions are 
a) How to quickly make out whether a sentence is in the passive voice or just a simple sentence (Stative)?

B) If i use had been in above sentence does it mean the same?
",user4084,https://ell.stackexchange.com/users/4084,"You said ""if we use the agent, the sentence becomes passive voice"".  I have to disagree.  In every one of your examples, the subject of the verb is the patient of the action.  Regardless of whether the agent is mentioned, those statements employ the passive voice.

You're asking how to distinguish something that doesn't need to be distinguished.  The question of passive vs. active voice is completely different than the question of stative vs. dynamic verbs -- in the same way that the question of how curly your hair is happens to be completely different than the question of how dark your hair is.

In an active voice construction, the subject causes the action.  In a passive voice construction, the subject receives the action.  It's easy to see that all of your sentences are passive voice constructions because its easy to find the active voice equivalents:

Someone parked the car. 
Something increased your work volume. 
Someone arrested him.


and so on.

Although the stative vs. dynamic distinction exists in English semantics, it isn't present in English grammar.  One rule of thumb is that stative verbs do not work well when employing the continuous aspect.  For example, ""I am knowing the answer"" is a poorly-formed sentence because the verb to know is stative.  It seems that every one of your passive voice examples uses a dynamic verb.

One car was being parked outside the gate when I left.
Your work volume is being increased during the holidays.
He was being arrested while I calmly walked away.


and so on.

A stative verb can be used in either the active or the passive voice:

My manager knows me to be an excellent employee.
I am known to be an excellent employee.


A dynamic verb can be used in either the active or the passive voice:

I parked the car outside the gate.
The car was parked outside the gate.


So, how do you distinguish between passive and stative?  You don't.  You distinguish between active and passive.  You distinguish between dynamic and stative.  You do those two things separately.  They are not related to each other.

&nbsp;



Now, as to your follow-up question, let's use the dynamic verb to park in the passive voice and indicative mode:

The car was parked -- past tense, indefinite aspect
The car is parked -- present tense, indefinite aspect
The car will be parked -- future tense, indefinite aspect

The car had been parked -- past tense, perfect aspect
The car has been parked -- present tense, perfect aspect
The car will have been parked -- future tense, perfect aspect


Does the meaning change?  Yes.  Aspect carries a different kind of meaning than tense, but both aspect and tense carry meaning.  Tense has to do with location in time.  Aspect has to do with a relationship with time.  Often tense and aspect are taught as a single, combined thing, but I find them easier to understand when they are examined as separate properties.

Changing the aspect does not change the tense.  Changing the aspect does not change the voice.  Changing the aspect does not change the nature of the verb, whether stative or dynamic.  

Because the perfect aspect has an explicit relationship with time, it makes the most sense when the time frame is also made explicit, as in ""The car has been parked there for several weeks"" or ""The car had been parked there for a month before anyone noticed it.""

&nbsp;

Whether a verb is stative or dynamic has very little impact on English grammar.  Certain verb forms don't make sense for stative verbs, and that's about it.  The properties of voice, tense, aspect and mode have a great deal of impact.  Changing any one of those requires changing something about the verb's form.



Let me see if I can clearly summarize all of that.


Which of the example sentences are passive voice?  All of them. 
Which of them are indicative sentences?  All of them. 
Which can be interpreted as having a participial subject complement?  All of them.
Which are stative?  None of them.   


Most of those are unrelated items. One pair is an identity.  The passive voice construction is a subset of the participial subject complement construction.

3730,3730,5943,Is it possible to cryptographically prove when was the last time a ciphertext was decrypted/encrypted?,"I want to provide a service that encrypts and decrypts documents and I want to provide the users with proof that I haven't stolen their secret key and read their documents.

I know I can prove when a document was last modified with cryptographic timestamping.  Is it possible to prove a document was or was not encrypted/decrypted in a given time period?

Off the top of my head, I'm thinking maybe there's some way to arrange that some kind of proof-of-work would be needed to encrypt/decrypt a document, but I'm not comfortable with inventing my own crypto.
",Michael,https://crypto.stackexchange.com/users/4311,"Updated answer:

No, this is not possible with cryptography.
You have the ciphertext and you have the key.
For all anyone knows, you could have made a copy of those to some other computer and decrypted the ciphertext without telling anyone.
There's no way (with cryptography) to prove you haven't done that.

One approach would be to implement a secure service and hire an independent auditor to audit your code and architecture and certify that you appear to have set things up in a way that protects your customers' data.  You could hire an independent security pro to review your system and write a public report that customers can view.  I don't know if this would give potential customers a better sense of comfort or if it would be worth the money.

The only approach I can think of, to solve this through technical means, would be to use trusted computing.  Trusted computing relies upon trusted hardware (TPMs), and its support for remote attestation would allow you to prove to others what code you are running.  You could publish the source to your software to allow anyone to verify that your software doesn't make a copy of their keys or their data, and use remote attestation to prove that you're using that good software.

However, using trusted computing in this way is extremely complicated.  Trusted computing is bleeding-edge stuff; it's an engineering and management hassle of major proportions.  Moreover, most customers probably won't have the patience, skills, or desire to undertake all of the tasks that would be required to verify that your system works properly.

So, I think there's no technical solution for your problem.  You'll have to rely upon your customer's trust, your reputation, contractual guarantees, and other social/legal means, instead of technical solutions.

A comment: your problem is more an information security problem than a cryptography problem.  Are you familiar with IT Security?



Original answer:

I think you need to define the problem better, to identify who are the principals/participants and what is the threat model.

If the decryptor knows the ciphertext and decryption key and wants to subvert the protocol, you cannot prove that the decryptor didn't decrypt the ciphertext.

The decryptor can prove that he did decrypt the ciphertext (using a zero-knowledge proof of knowledge, possibly with some timestamping).  However, he cannot prove that he read the decrypted message or paid attention to it or acted on it, so I suspect this will be basically useless in practice.

If you can limit access to the ciphertext or the decryption key, then you can prove some partial statements.  For instance, if you don't release the ciphertext to anyone until time $t$, you can prove that no one could possibly have decrypted it before time $t$.  If you know the key, though, you won't be able to prove that you didn't release it before time $t$ (except possibly through use of TPMs / trusted computing), so you'll probably need to be trusted for this to be meaningful.

There are many other possible scenarios -- to propose a specific solution, we'll probably need to know the threat model and requirements in a bit more detail.

2448,2448,3907,Two different analytic curves cannot intersect in infinitely many points,"A curve in Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^n$, $n \geq 2$ is $analytic$ if the coordinates of its points $x= x_{1},...,x_{n}$ can be expressed as analytic functions of a real parameter $x_{i}=x_{i}(t)$, $i=1,...,n$ and $\alpha \leq t \leq \beta$ and the derivatives $x'(t_{0})$ do not simultaneously vanish for any $t_{0} \in [\alpha, \beta]$.
I search for a proof of the following fact:

If the set of intersection points of two analytic curves is infinite, then these curves coincide.

Can we prove the same as above if we relax the condition that the coordinates are analytic to the condition that the coordinates belong to the class $C^{\infty}$?

Edit: Thanks to below remark by Ramiro, to obtain the above implication, we have to assume that any two curves $K_{1}, K_{2}$ as in the question are such that $K_{1} \cap K_{2}$ is not another analytic curve.

2nd edit: As suggested Peter, we can reformulate our question as follows:
   Consider two immersed curves which are parameterized real analytically on compact intervals. If they have an infinite number of different intersection points, then their union is again a real analytic immersed curve. 
",Grzegorz Tomkowicz,https://mathoverflow.net/users/31376,"Wrong: $t\mapsto \binom{t}{\sin(t)}$ and $t\mapsto\binom{t}{\cos(t)}$.

Edit: Grzegorz pointed out that $t$ is in a compact interval $[\alpha,\beta]$.
Under this assumption the statement is correct.

Proof: Let $f,g:[\alpha,\beta]\to \mathbb R^n$ be the two real analytically parameterized curves which intersect in $f(t_i)=g(t_i), i=1,2,\dots$ different points. Then the $t_i$ have accumulation points in $[\alpha,\beta]$, thus $f$ and $g$ coincide on $[\alpha,\beta]$.

In the $C^\infty$ case the statement is wrong: Let $[\alpha,\beta]=[0,1]$ and consider
$$f(t) = \binom{t}{e^{-1/t^2}\sin(1/t)},\qquad g(t)=\binom{t}{0}.$$

2nd edit: Noam pointed out that my proof above was not conclusive. 
So let me try again: Suppose that $f(t_i)=g(u_i)$ for sequences of distinct points.
The $t_i$ have accumulation an point $t$ and the $u_i$ have an accumulation point $u$.
By continuity, $x=f(t)=g(u)$. Now we change both parameterizations as follows:
Choose a line $r\mapsto x + r.v$ for a vector $v$ such that both curves are transversal to the hyperplane $v^\bot$. Since both curves are immersions (if I understood the question right),
such $v$ exists. Now consider the orthogonal projection of both curves onto this line. In a neighborhood of $r=0$ these are real analytic diffeomorphisms, so their inverses gives us new parameterizations of both curves in the parameter $r$. There are still infinitely many intersection points of the two curves near $x$, but these intersections happen now at the same 
parameter values $r_i$ with $r_i\to 0$ without loss. Now my proof from above applies. 

I hope that I did not overlook something else this time. Many thanks for pointing out my mistakes. 

3rd edit: I overlooked again something (Thanks SJR and Ramiro). So what I proved is:
The intersection of the two curves contains an open interval in each curve. Note that each curve, as an immersion, is locally a real analytic submanifold.  

4th edit: Grzegorz, to the new question you posed in the comment, the following comes to my mind:
By a theorem of Whitney, any closed set in $\mathbb R^n$ is the zero locus of a smooth function. So take a set in $\mathbb R$ like the Cantor set which in uncountable, and a smooth function on $\mathbb R$ vanishing exactly on this set. The graph of this function and the $x$-axis are two $C^\infty$-curves which intersect in this set.

What do mean by: $K_1\cap K_2$ is not $C^\infty$?

5th edit: Grzegorz, instead of excluding Ramiro's example in your edit of the question,
you could reformulate as follows:

Consider two  immersed curves which are parameterized real analytically on compact intervals.
If they have an infinite number of different intersection points, then their union is again a real analytic immersed curve.

Edit: Grzegorz pointed out that $t$ is in a compact interval $[\alpha,\beta]$.
Under this assumption the statement is correct.

Proof: Let $f,g:[\alpha,\beta]\to \mathbb R^n$ be the two real analytically parameterized curves which intersect in $f(t_i)=g(t_i), i=1,2,\dots$ different points. Then the $t_i$ have accumulation points in $[\alpha,\beta]$, thus $f$ and $g$ coincide on $[\alpha,\beta]$.

In the $C^\infty$ case the statement is wrong: Let $[\alpha,\beta]=[0,1]$ and consider
$$f(t) = \binom{t}{e^{-1/t^2}\sin(1/t)},\qquad g(t)=\binom{t}{0}.$$

2nd edit: Noam pointed out that my proof above was not conclusive. 
So let me try again: Suppose that $f(t_i)=g(u_i)$ for sequences of distinct points.
The $t_i$ have accumulation an point $t$ and the $u_i$ have an accumulation point $u$.
By continuity, $x=f(t)=g(u)$. Now we change both parameterizations as follows:
Choose a line $r\mapsto x + r.v$ for a vector $v$ such that both curves are transversal to the hyperplane $v^\bot$. Since both curves are immersions (if I understood the question right),
such $v$ exists. Now consider the orthogonal projection of both curves onto this line. In a neighborhood of $r=0$ these are real analytic diffeomorphisms, so their inverses gives us new parameterizations of both curves in the parameter $r$. There are still infinitely many intersection points of the two curves near $x$, but these intersections happen now at the same 
parameter values $r_i$ with $r_i\to 0$ without loss. Now my proof from above applies. 

I hope that I did not overlook something else this time. Many thanks for pointing out my mistakes. 

3rd edit: I overlooked again something (Thanks SJR and Ramiro). So what I proved is:
The intersection of the two curves contains an open interval in each curve. Note that each curve, as an immersion, is locally a real analytic submanifold.

197,197,317,"Learning how to be a good rhythm guitarist before becoming a lead guitarist, where to start?","I have recently been trying to hone in my improvisational skills. I'm stuck in the first position of the Am pentatonic box and can't move away from it. Whenever I try to move out of it, I randomize the next box that I go to, which most of the time leads to bad sounding improvisations.

I have narrowed the problem down to it being me having a bad sense of rhythm. I think I've got technique as a rhythm guitarist, but in regards to musicality, I don't. 

I don't know which chords go together well, what goes after a chord, how minors, majors and 7ths are formed (don't know if this is important to be a good rhythm guitarist though), etc.
",reverb,https://music.stackexchange.com/users/6204,"I think there's some possibility for confusion of terms because lead and rhythm means different things depending on what precise area you're talking about.

In a rock band, there's usually a division between the rhythm guitar whose job is primarily harmony and chords (the left hand of the piano) and the lead guitar whose job is to play little melodies and solos (the right hand of the piano). You don't need to learn rhythm first. Rhythm isn't any less musical than lead playing. And playing lead well requires lots of rhythmic ability.

Definitely work on your rhythm-playing even if you don't intend to be a rhythm player. Many lead-guitar effects like syncopation and suspension require a keen rhythmic sense to accomplish. Sometimes a lead can be as simple as copying the rhythm part, replacing full-chords with power-chords, or replacing power-chords with dyads or just the root notes. 



If you try to view the two guitarists as team whose job it is to play the song, then you can steer away from the view that the lead is more important and the rhythm should be delegated to the junior of the two. Rhythm and lead both have a function to serve and sometimes the rhythm is more important, sometime less important. Sometimes you gotta tell the soloist to chillax a few bars and let this groove breathe. The lead is the driver, but the rhythm is the horsepower. 

And lead playing can be very rhythmic. Listen to some Louis Armstrong trumpet solos where he's just wailing the hell out of one note. But all the bending and wiggling is in rhythm.

I just want to copy all the field and layer configuration information from the original file. I do this now:,"Use Fiona of Sean Gillies , a very simple wrapper of the OGR library (The Fiona User Manual)

All the elements of a shapefile (schema, records) are processed using Python dictionaries:

schema of one of my shapefiles as example:


  {'geometry': 'LineString', 'properties': {u'faille': 'str:20', u'type': 'str:20', u'id': 'int'}}


one record in the shapefile:


  {'geometry': {'type': 'LineString', 'coordinates': [(269884.20917418826, 151805.1917153612), (270409.89083992655, 153146.21637285672), (272298.05355768028, 154047.38494269375), (272941.74539327814, 155484.96337552898), (272169.31519056071, 156117.92701386689)]}, 'id': '1',  'properties': {'faille': u'de Salinas', 'type': u'normale'}}


so to duplicate a shapefile:

from shapely.geometry import mapping, shape
import fiona
# Read the original Shapefile
with fiona.collection('original.shp', 'r') as input:
    # The output has the same schema
    schema = input.schema.copy()
    # write a new shapefile
    with fiona.collection(''file1.shp', 'w', 'ESRI Shapefile', schema) as output:
        for elem in input:
             output.write({'properties': elem['properties'],'geometry': mapping(shape(elem['geometry']))})


If you want to split a large shapefile into many smaller ones, everything takes place in the for loop but all the schemas of the original shapefile are preserved in the dictionary with schema = input.schema.copy() and {'properties': elem['properties']

patch your changes. Are there bigger changes to the sectioning

5623,5623,8918,How can I enable HttpOnly cookies in EE,"Update:
Thanks to Dom Stubbs, I have an extension to accomplish this now.  It is up on devot-ee and also up on GitHub.  Thanks Dom!

The Original Question

I am nearly through a security review of a new EE2 version of an existing EE1 site that I hope to launch soon.  One of the final issues remaining is to make the cookies HttpOnly.  I've tried doing that through this line in the apache config:

Header edit Set-Cookie ""(?i)^((?:(?!;\s?HttpOnly).)+)$"" ""$1; HttpOnly""


Using the dev tools in my browser I can see that it does indeed append HttpOnly to the Set-Cookie headers, but the issue then becomes that I cannot log in.  When I asked Ellislab they tell me that the cookies should not be being dealt with in javascript, which was what I expected the issue might be.

ExpressionEngine does not seem to use the session libraries from codeignitor, if it did I could set a config variable to turn httponly on, but it looks like the session handling code is in the expressionengine side of things.

The real question that I need answered is how can I make HttpOnly cookies work, but I guess that breaks down into some potential subquestions:


Am I missing an addon that would allow me to do this without a lot more heartache?Is there something wrong with my apache approach?  Are you able to log in if you enable that in Apache, log out and try to log back in?
Is there something wrong with my apache approach?  Are you able to log in if you enable that in Apache, log out and try to log back in?
Failing these, can anybody give me a hint as to where cookies are being set in expressionengine so I can dig in there and try to fix this?

""Additional certificate about grading system.""
",Khashayar,https://ell.stackexchange.com/users/11935,"Good question! 

I won't get into the nuance of what that certificate is all about. I'd address the question in the title -do you say certificate 'about' or 'of'.

Though both convey the same meaning, in my opinion, in most of the cases, when you say 'certificate about...' it takes a phrase. I mean to say that there could be some explanation of what that certificate is all about, and not just one word.

For instance a doctor's certificate about the applicant's fitness for the job 

On the other hand, 'certificate of' is short and terse. It directly says what is that certificate with no explanation.

I won't get into the nuance of what that certificate is all about. I'd address the question in the title -do you say certificate 'about' or 'of'.

Though both convey the same meaning, in my opinion, in most of the cases, when you say 'certificate about...' it takes a phrase. I mean to say that there could be some explanation of what that certificate is all about, and not just one word.

For instance a doctor's certificate about the applicant's fitness for the job 

On the other hand, 'certificate of' is short and terse. It directly says what is that certificate with no explanation. 

Say - a certificate of registration/membership/excellence/participation...and so on

1635,1635,2565,"What is the Goal of ""Hot Network Questions""?","There has been a tug-of-war in the hot-questions list.

Community members like JonW seem to be unhappy with the traffic that it brings to their site:


  'But we want to encourage people to post, that's the whole point of the HQ list!' I hear you cry. I disagree. We want to encourage people to the site not just to that question.


The SE Community Team seems to have a different opinion as Shog9 points out (emphasis mine):


  the results have been... Not great so far: a significantly smaller number of people are clicking through to randomly-selected questions than to the top questions, which hints that the algorithm may've been doing a better job of identifying general-interest questions across topics than some expected.


Disclaimer: This should not be taken as a slight of the community team whatsoever, nor do I think this is some cause for revolt or a boxing match as the below prose may indicate. These are just poorly applied literary tools to emphasize the drastically different approaches to the same list between two groups.

In the Red Corner, the Community Members

The goal of the hot questions should be to drive up interest in the site. The hot questions should be a lure to encourage SE network users to contribute to other content, not just do a drive-by on the hot question.

In the Blue Corner, the Community Team

The goal of the hot questions should be to drive traffic to general-interest questions. After all, the Hot Network Questions used to be more accurately named as ""Popular Questions"".

What is the Goal of Advertising Network Questions?

Before discussing how to calculate hotness, or how the list should be ordered, we need to come to an agreement on what the heck we are actually trying to achieve. Once we know what we are looking to accomplish, we can find the best way to do that.

The list of questions from a variety of sites is in a great location screen-wise, it is readily accessible and does get a lot of eyes on it. But as with any marketing, the goal isn't just to grab eyes, it's to grab the right eyes.*

* I have nothing against left eyes. Most of my friends have left eyes too. And they are awesome. But in the context right eyes are not a geospatial thing, but rather in the 'correct' sense.

So what are the right eyes? What type of people do we want to attract to our site? What would we determine as 'success'? How can we measure that success?

Please do not limit yourself to the very narrowly scoped topic above. Think outside the box if you'd like. On every page across the network we have a nice piece of real estate for showing off the rest of the network. How can that space best be used if not on a list of questions picked by an arbitrary algorithm?

I participate in two sites that suffer from overly hot questions: Programmers and Workplace. In my experience, communities at these sites close inappropriate questions pretty fast, which wipes them from hot list and makes it not an issue.

Questions that really suffer from senseless over-exposure are reasonable ones, those that match site quality requirements and don't deserve closure, nor even downvotes, neither from passers by nor from community regulars.

The only remaining way to ""fix"" these questions, if one takes above suggestion seriously, is to cast unfair down and close votes. However pragmatic it may sound, I believe that this is a fundamentally wrong way, as it suggests bending community morale as a workaround for feature that just poorly implements specification.

One day with the amp power on I tightened/snugged up the speaker binding post. There was a single frayed speaker wire (unnoticed) that shorted. The amp proceed to billow smoke. I looked inside to find several power supply caps having oozed their electrolyte onto the circuit board.

As you can see in the third line of code im trying to get information from the database that I have saved. The problem is I dont know how would i get it properly. And then I want to pass it down in the var locations part in the script..

I have tried finding some tutorials where they explain how would this work but most of them is just how to show some posts or somthing like that and that doesnt help me.

Thanks for help already! :)

// EDIT

This is the script that i have now in js file

(function($) {
     Drupal.behaviors.myModule = {
       attach: function(context, settings) {

          function initialize() {

          var mapOptions = {
             center: { lat: 56.9714744, lng: 24.1291624},
             zoom: 9
          };
          var map = new google.maps.Map(document.getElementById('map-canvas'),
        mapOptions);

    var locations = [
                    ['Mājas',56.956344, 24.197409],
                    ['Domina',56.966058, 24.162004]
                    ];

    for (var i = 0; i &lt; locations.length; i++) {

      var loc = new google.maps.LatLng(locations[i][1], locations[i][2]);

      var marker = new google.maps.Marker({
        position: loc,
        map: map,
        title: locations[i][0]
      });
    };

  }

  //google.maps.event.addDomListener(window, 'load', initialize);

}


}
 )(jQuery);

I have the ""google.maps.event.addDomListener(window, 'load', initialize);"" commented becouse I think i dont need it..? And becouse there is no function initialize anymore? Or should i add that back?

The problem now is that my script seems to be added.. But it doesnt seem to be run becouse the google map dosnt show up..

I have a stylish car with 0.5 alpha windows, that I wish to render on a camera background, seeking some augmented reality goodness.

The alpha on the windows looks okay, but when I add the object, I notice that it renders the entire object transparently, where the windows are. Including interior of the car.

Like so (in example, keyboard can be seen through the dashboard, seats and so on. should be solid)

For observer wards, you can try the usual ward spots (runes/rosh/hills).... however, if your five-man push fails because the enemy saw you coming, there are a lot of possible ward spots you may have walked by. And how about countering sentry wards to protect a riki/gondar/brood?
",Robert Fraser,https://gaming.stackexchange.com/users/3074,"The true answer is not to guess, but to know. Watch your minimap and your opponents' inventories constantly. In most games, it will be the enemy support heroes placing the majority if not all of the wards so you'll know where to focus your attention. If they are carrying wards you need to monitor their hero as much as possible and notice when that ward count drops by 1. When it does, you should know where they've been and where the common ward spots in that area are. If you've kept Observer Wards up yourself, you can determine exactly where they've placed it because doing so causes an animation. If you don't see this, you can usually narrow it down to one of a few spots and counterward appropriately. Most good counterwarding locations will reveal multiple frequently warded spots in an area- the reveal range of 950 is much larger than the vision range.

It's also worth noting that many of the common support heroes have spells that reveal high ground (allowing you to counter wards on hills or high ground that you couldn't otherwise see). AA's slow, Dazzle's ultimate, VS's howl, and others.

The other way to counterward requires a lot of experience and an expectation of high level opposition. Judging from how your opponents react to movement and gank attempts by your own team, you can tell when they've spotted someone moving between lanes and thus where they've warded. This is much more difficult and really only applicable if you're playing against competent opponents, weaker players are usally too sporadic for their reactions to be of much use. For example, I know that after a successful teamfight win in midgame by a good opposing team their supports will probably be spending the downtime placing offensive wards. With a combination of everything you've read above, I can make the chances of succesfully counterwarding worth the 100 gold chance to possibly catch a ward even if I don't know exactly where one has been placed.

As for the second part of your question, you will never really deliberately counter Sentry Wards unless it's to protect your own Observer Wards since doing so requires that the area be clear of opponents and thus their Sentry wards are unlikely to be used again anyway, they only last 3 minutes. If you really want to do so because your team is relying heavily on invisibility, a Gem is preferable because it will allow you to both reveal Sentries as you move around the map and also allow you to counter Observer Wards. This is only viable if carried by a hard to kill member of your team or the invisible hero they're countering, however. You don't want to die and give the other team the gem.

As for the second part of your question, you will never really deliberately counter Sentry Wards unless it's to protect your own Observer Wards since doing so requires that the area be clear of opponents and thus their Sentry wards are unlikely to be used again anyway, they only last 3 minutes. If you really want to do so because your team is relying heavily on invisibility, a Gem is preferable because it will allow you to both reveal Sentries as you move around the map and also allow you to counter Observer Wards. This is only viable if carried by a hard to kill member of your team or the invisible hero they're countering, however. You don't want to die and give the other team the gem.

If you look for Cold Iron on Wikipedia, you only get iron: 
""Cold iron is a poetic and archaic term for iron.""
This would imply everything made mostly from Fe is cold iron. Clearly, this is not the case, in every game Cold Iron is something special, the every day sword is not made out of it.

  something that anyone could reasonably get access to, but usually doesn’t carry on them (like cold iron) page 185.


What is cold iron?

2591,2591,4121,Are there /ɔ/ and /ʌ/ sounds in informal American English?,"I read a book about American English. It reports that, in standard informal conversations, American English doesn't use the /ɔ/ sound; it uses the /ɑ/ sound and /ʌ/ and /ə/ are not different. Are they really?
That book would not use the /ɔ/ and /ʌ/ sounds, but when I look in my American English Dictionary for some words, such as more, door, and love, they are reported to be pronounced /mɔr/, /dɔr/, and /lʌv/.
How should I pronounce these words, if there are no /ɔ/and /ʌ/ sounds?  Should they be /mɑr/, /dɑr/, and /ləv/?
Can /ɑ/ sound replace /ɔ/, and /ə/ replace /ʌ/ in every word?
What about formal American English? Does it have /ɔ /and /ʌ/ sounds or not?
",Kas,https://english.stackexchange.com/users/10792,"Standard English has all of the sounds you mention, but, yes there are some quirks.

Some dialects of English don't distinguish between /ɔ/ and /ɑ/; this is known as the caught-cot merger.  It is so called because caught and cot are both pronounced the same: (/kɒːt/ or /kɑt/ depending on the region).  As you can see in the Wikipedia article and the accompanying map, some dialects have merged these vowels together, but many have not.

Now, as for /ə/ and /ʌ/ — AmE does have both of these sounds, but in most cases the pattern is totally predictable.  In stressed syllables, /ʌ/ can occur, while in unstressed syllables, only /ə/ is used.  

In Standard British English, there is more use of /ə/, in part because Standard BrE doesn't pronounce /ɹ/ (henceforth /r/) syllable-finally.  So a word like nurse, which in American English would be pronounced /nɝs/ (with an r-colored vowel), can be pronounced /nə:s/ in British English (though it isn't always).

So, with this information in mind, on to your examples:

""More"" and ""door""

Examples with syllable-final /r/ are generally going to be special, as indeed these are.  In Standard AmE, these are pronounced /mɔr/ and /dɔr/, as you read.  In dialects that don't pronounce /ɔ/, the words are pronounced /mor/ and /dor/.  In situations that aren't r-colored, it is indeed /ɑ/ (again, in certain US dialects).

""Love""

Following the rules I laid out above, you may have figured out that love is pronounced /lʌv/ in AmE, as it is a stressed syllable.  But, if it were unstressed, it would theoretically be pronounced with a schwa.  

So, let's take a different example: the word ""just"" /dʒʌst/ is sometimes stressed and sometimes unstressed.  When unstressed (often when saying something like ""just do it already""), the word becomes /dʒəst/.

2023,2023,3226,"Learning the musical concepts in the book ""Gödel, Escher, Bach""","I am reading the book ""Gödel, Escher, Bach"", in which the author tries to present concepts in mathematics, drawings and music as instances of a certain ""pattern"", that he calls ""strange loops"". He makes several comments about Bach's music, in particular, as the title suggests. So, he talks about the fugues, sonatas and partitas, modulation, themes played against themselves, how Bach manages to get two or more musical lines going simultaneously and so on.

But I don't understand a thing about these musical concepts. I have tried to listen on YouTube to some of the compositions he mentions in the book, but my stupid brain only hears a stream of notes flowing. I can't recognize the patterns he talks about, nor can I grasp, for example, the fact the the ""Canon per Tonos"" rises successively until it reaches the key C again. 

So how can I learn more about these musical concepts, so as to better follow the book's main ideas? To make this question narrower, I'm not asking for general references to learn about music, but something very specific to the content of the book, so that I don't miss important information (and fun) from his exposition.

1207,1207,1897,How do I create a great fantasy villain that inspires the party to rally against them?,"In my early years of GMing it was simple enough to say that the badguys were evil and that was all the justification we needed.  They are attacking the village because they are evil, they are stealing the princess because they are evil, etc.

Over time, my group needs have grown to need more complicated and detailed villains. It is important to consider motives.  What is it that defines them as 'evil' to the party?  In terms of a fantasy setting, what would you consider to be an interesting villain?

What qualities make a villain that inspires your party to rally against him?  What kind of villains have worked for your games in the past?

Example:


  A member of nobility is using trade connections to move valuable pieces of art into another country that is secretly paying him quite well and is framing a member of the party to take the fall.  In addition, someone important to the party member has been taken hostage with a promise of release once they party member takes the blame for the crime.

Motivations for doing what he does. There's this cliche, ""nobody thinks of themselves as evil."" That's not true for all settings, but I think it is fair to say that very few villains are just evil for the sake of cackling. So you should figure out what's driving your bad guys.
Shades of grey. The degree depends, again, on the setting and the genre. However, if you want your players to really think about the villain, there ought to be a few things about him that don't meet their expectations. Maybe the example noble wants to both make money and save the art from danger.

",Jilong Yin,https://tex.stackexchange.com/users/63834,"Assume that columns B, C, and D are of the p type with usable widths given by the length parameters \colB, \colC, and \colD. In your example code, these lengths are equal to 2cm each. The total widths of columns B, C, and D are, however, not equal to 2cm. Instead, each column's total width equals 2cm+2\tabcolsep, where \tabcolsep is the parameter that governs the amount of whitespace inserted to the left and right of a column. (In the standard LaTeX document classes, the default value of this parameter is 6pt.)

The combined width of columns B, C, and D -- not counting the widths of the vertical bars to the left of B and to the right of D -- is 

\colB + \colC + \colD + 6\tabcolsep + 2\arrayrulewidth 


(I'm assuming, implicitly, that the array package is being loaded. If that's not the case, then one should omit the 2\arrayrulewidth term.) You can probably guess that 2\arrayrulewidth represents the combined widths of the two interior vertical bars -- those separating B from C and C from D. The default value of this parameter is 0.4pt in the standard document classes.

The usable width of the three columns is a bit smaller, since we mustn't impose on \tabcolsep at the left-hand edge of B and at the right-hand edge of D. It is thus given by 

\colB + \colC + \colD + 4\tabcolsep + 2\arrayrulewidth


One can create a length variable called, say, \combinedlength and set its value to the expression above. The contents of the external file table.tex would thus be given by

4123,4123,6579,Information to include with a fine art print?,"I am just beginning to sell some of my images and would like to personalize them a little.  Many photographers sign and title their work on the white space just below the printed image. I am having metal prints made so there is no matting or white space, so I considered printing small (2""x3.5"") stickers to place on the back of the images. What information do you think should be included on that sticker? Pretty much everything I've found online talks about a certificate of authenticity and limited editions. I do not want limited editions but would like to sign and number my larger prints. Does anyone have experience with this? Do I need to print a separate certificate? At this juncture my sticker will have my logo, image title, artist name (me), place for my signature and date, ""edition #xx of an open edition"". Some sites mention including the date the photograph was taken; format (i.e. 24""x36"" photographic print on metal), though it seems redundant since it will be on the back of the print; same goes for description of artwork, as well as copyright as I am signing and dating it. I do plan on printing a second sticker with care instructions (i.e. hang indoors and out of direct sunlight etc.).  

Revision to clarify:
What information should be included? Do I need to put copyright information if I am signing it? Is it necessary to include the format of the print or the shot on date?  Should I also be providing a certificate of authenticity?

Thank you!

2738,2738,4367,"Learning the musical concepts in the book ""Gödel, Escher, Bach""","I am reading the book ""Gödel, Escher, Bach"", in which the author tries to present concepts in mathematics, drawings and music as instances of a certain ""pattern"", that he calls ""strange loops"". He makes several comments about Bach's music, in particular, as the title suggests. So, he talks about the fugues, sonatas and partitas, modulation, themes played against themselves, how Bach manages to get two or more musical lines going simultaneously and so on.

But I don't understand a thing about these musical concepts. I have tried to listen on YouTube to some of the compositions he mentions in the book, but my stupid brain only hears a stream of notes flowing. I can't recognize the patterns he talks about, nor can I grasp, for example, the fact the the ""Canon per Tonos"" rises successively until it reaches the key C again. 

So how can I learn more about these musical concepts, so as to better follow the book's main ideas? To make this question narrower, I'm not asking for general references to learn about music, but something very specific to the content of the book, so that I don't miss important information (and fun) from his exposition.

My understanding of the book (which I did not finish) was that there is an overall theme of language, which is then illustrated through the three artists.

3851,3851,6122,What are the chances of something *not* occurring?,"Suppose I'm gambling using a strategy of doubling my bet whenever I lose to recoup my losses from previous bets. If my initial bet is 1/2048 of my capital, I can bet 10 times before I run out of money. Statistics says that the chances of this happening are ~1/718. As the law of large numbers states, though, this is in no way a guarantee that such an outcome will manifest in any certain number of iterations.

Is it possible, therefore, to calculate the chances that this doesn't happen? For example, is there an equation we can put x (the number of bets) into and determine the likelihood of this 1/718 chance not occurring? My chances of losing within the first ten bets would be extremely small, and my chances after ten thousand would be pretty high, so is there any way to calculate the middle ground?

$P(E)+P(\overline{E})=1$ (where $\overline{E}$ is the complement of $E$, or  'not-$E$'). So if the 1/718 chance of losing it all in ten bets was accurate, then the chance of not losing it all in ten bets is $1-\frac{_1}{^{718}}$.

Something like this. Except I feel like the light will escape given enough time. Also, the object has to be finite in size (infinite is cheating). If there's a proof that no such container exists then that's fine too.

545,545,858,How Do I Fix Excess Contribution Withdrawl,"This is a kind of a straight forward situation but I made it little complex due to my limited knowledge of Traditional IRA and 401(k).

In the year 2012, I was working as a contractor. I had a traditional IRA account with Fidelity and contributed $4000 to it for the Tax Year 2012.

Later in that year (2012), I got a full time job and my employer enrolled me in their 401(k) plan.

When the time came to file the taxes, I called Fidelity and explained them the situation as I thought I cannot contribute to Traditional IRA as I have employer sponsored 401(k). Someone at the Fidelity said I can withdraw the money as ""Excess Contribution Withdrawal"". So I filled out the form and pulled $4000 from it. I did not claim the $4000 contribution in my tax return as ""Traditional IRA Contribution"". I just treated it as like I never contributed that money.

Now I got 1099-R from them saying the $4000 that I withdraw was actually processed as ""Early Withdrawal"" and I have to pay tax (33%) on it.

When I explained them what happened in 2012, they said they may be able to go back and correct the problem.

What I do not understand is that even if they correct the situation and send me revised 1099-R, I will still pay Tax on $4000 as it will be treated as ""Excess Contribution"".

Why can this not be simple as I made a mistake when I contributed the money and then I took it back and did not claim so that should be treated as like it never went to my IRA account.

What can I do to avoid paying ""Excess Withdrawal"" tax as I already paid the tax on this $4000 as I never claimed them on my 2012 return.

Am I missing something here or am I not able to explain them the situation correctly?
",Asdfg,https://money.stackexchange.com/users/5105,"I think there are several issues here.

First, there's the contribution. As littleadv said, there is no excess contribution. Excess contribution is only if you exceed the contribution limit. The contribution limit for Traditional IRAs does not depend on how high your income goes or whether you have a 401(k). It's the deduction limit that may depend on those things. Not deducting it is perfectly legitimate, and is completely different than an ""excess contribution"", which has a penalty.

Second, the withdrawal. You are allowed to withdraw contributions made during a year, plus any earnings from those contributions, before the tax filing deadline for the taxes of that year (which is April 15 of the following year, or even up to October 15 of the following year), and it will be treated as if the contribution never happened. No penalties. The earnings will be taxed as regular income (as if you put it in a bank account). That sounds like what you did. So the withdrawal was not an ""early withdrawal"", and the 1099-R should reflect that (what distribution code did they put?).

Third, even if (and it does not sound like the case, but if) it doesn't qualify as a return of contributions before the tax due date as described above (maybe you withdrew it after October 15 of the following year), as littleadv mentioned, your contribution was a non-deductible contribution, and when withdrawing it, only the earnings portion (which after such a short time should only be a very small part of the distribution) would be subject to tax and penalty.

Can I suggest that when you get this back up and running you configure the disk group to only have a single spare, not double - not for such a small array. Then use either VRAID 6 or 10 (0+1 actually), they're much more resilient than VRAID 5.

1675,1675,2649,mixing two asymmetrical random number generator streams,"Knuth describes in ""the art of computer programming part 2"" an algorithm called ""M"" for mixing two streams of random numbers. This can be used to mix random number streams giving the assurance that the result is still random even if one (but only one) of the streams suddenly becomes predictable.

Now I have a situation where I do have two streams but they're asymmetrical: one produces +/- 800 bytes per second, the other +/- 340.

My question now is: what can I do so that I can still combine these two and accomplish the same as Knuth's algorithm?

I was thinking of ""just feeding them to a hash"" and use that result.
What do you think?
",Folkert van Heusden,https://crypto.stackexchange.com/users/2709,"You can slow the faster stream down to match the slower (e.g. throw away about half the bytes) and use Knuth's algorithm. You will only run at the speed of the slower, but that's the only way to assure full entropy when only one of the streams is unpredictable.

If you want to also account for cases where both streams are only partially unpredictable, you could use a hash instead. E.g. take the SHA-256 of the concatenation of 40 bytes from stream A and 17 bytes from stream B, then truncate that to 17 bytes. For example, if the high bit in each input byte was predictable, this hash would still be completely unpredictable, while the XOR would not.

However, hashing may lose some entropy in the case where stream A is completely predictable, but stream B completely unpredictable.

I am therefore interested in learning how to ward effectively.


What are good/important spots for wards?
How do I time wards? When should I leave the lane?
And if there there different types of wards like in LoL: when to use which one?

Read full guide here for more detailed explanations about the marked colors and places.

For average skill games with low warding and no counterwards,you should focus mainly on red dots especially 2 hills near the runes with the priority of upper one in early game and lower one later when killing roshan becomes more likely.


Having at least one ward near the rune will eliminate the chance of
going the wrong side when timing runes
the hills will give you more vision than placing wards on the ground
easily prevent ganks since the river is most common way for ganking
seeing enemy team attacking roshan is huge advantage
also it reveals path near secret shop and neutral camp 




Wards should be placed as early as it gets and replaced just a bit before they expire(you can see the timer),it is the best if you can go grab a rune and place new ward at the same time so you don't lose much ""lane time"",if it is on opposite lane you could port there and combine it with a gank or push attempt.
