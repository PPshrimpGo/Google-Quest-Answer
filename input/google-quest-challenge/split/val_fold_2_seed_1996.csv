Do I need to use captcha if I am using AntiForgeryToken  in an MVC application.
Does AntiForgeryToken prevents automated form submission?
Can I use AntiForgeryToken as an alternative to captcha?

",Twix,https://security.stackexchange.com/users/54763,"To answer a bit more explicitly:


  Do I need to use captcha if I am using AntiForgeryToken in an MVC
  application.


If automated submissions are a problem then yes.


  Does AntiForgeryToken prevents automated form submission?


No. A CSRF token basically ensures that a user visits a page (eg. the one which contains the form) before another action takes place (eg. that form was submitted). A bot could easily obtain a valid token to submit a form.


  Can I use AntiForgeryToken as an alternative to captcha?


No. Arguably a CAPTCHA might be able to replace a CSRF token but a CAPTCHA probably isn't practical on every form which needs CSRF protection (eg. one in an admin panel).

Is there some way, to alter envelope sender on delivery ?  

Are smtp_generic_maps ment for this ? 

If so, is it okay, that my server sends an e-mail using specific envelope sender, and then something else in message being forwarded ?

4300,4300,6854,Get latitude/longitude of friend's current_location using Graph FQL,"I'm trying to get the latitude/longitude of all of a user's friends using a single API call. I believe I need to write a multi-query FQL statement, but I can't get the syntax correct.

I believe the two queries need to be something like the following:

'""friends"":""SELECT uid,current_location FROM user WHERE uid IN (SELECT uid2 FROM friend WHERE uid1 = me())""'

'""location"":""SELECT location FROM page WHERE id IN (SELECT current_location_id FROM #friends)""';


My problem is that somehow I need to get the ID of the current_location in the first query so that I can reference it in the second query, but I only know how to get an array that contains the id.

Thanks for any help!

Clarification:

I'm not trying to get check-ins of friends.  Instead I want to graph the ""current_location"" (i.e. where they live) of all of a user's friends on a Geo map.  I can get a user's ""current_location"" with the following FQL query:

""SELECT uid,sex,current_location FROM user WHERE uid IN (SELECT uid2 FROM friend WHERE uid1 = me())""


This query returns the following array:

[current_location] =&gt; Array

""SELECT location,name FROM page WHERE page_id = 108424279189115)""


To get the latitude and longitude of the current_location.  Currently, I have a working code that runs the first FQL query, then extracts page_id in php, and then runs a second FQL query to get the current_location latitude/longitude.

Someone can be an amazing developer knowing only the basics like addition, multiplication and basic logical operations.

Most of the developers will not solve a single equation during their professional career, and things like big O notation can be grasped in non mathematical way as well. You just think about the stuff, imagine bits flipped in your head, and voila, you can tell what kind of big O the stuff is, if someone explains what log and power is.

Sometimes math can make it simple, or it can make you feel proud that you proved something, since you can extend the meaning of programming to a mathematical domain via naming it discrete maths and such, but learning a lot of differential equations and integrals, and how to prove that, is IMHO not exactly the best idea what to do if you want to succeed as a programmer.

At least I haven't touched the maths for 10 years, I had arguments with my math professors all the time, and when I needed a math for realtime rendering, I learned everything from programmers side of view, without any proving any theorems, and for me it was simple and easy to grasp compared to all the stuff math professors where putting in our heads with a comment of ""you can't be a good programmer if you don't know the math"". Sure you can, easy!

I now know the mathematical stuff, so that I can talk with math-background programmers with all the log's differentials and stuff, but only for the reason so that they wouldn't faint. Because that stuff is useless 99.9% of the time, and when it is, it can be learned 1000x more effectively from programmers viewpoint.

Heck, programmers need at least 5 years to master a programming language+frameworks+best practices. Why on earth they should learn how to prove the theorems? Math student's do the math stuff, programmers get that stuff running, that's how it should work.

Sometimes math can make it simple, or it can make you feel proud that you proved something, since you can extend the meaning of programming to a mathematical domain via naming it discrete maths and such, but learning a lot of differential equations and integrals, and how to prove that, is IMHO not exactly the best idea what to do if you want to succeed as a programmer.

At least I haven't touched the maths for 10 years, I had arguments with my math professors all the time, and when I needed a math for realtime rendering, I learned everything from programmers side of view, without any proving any theorems, and for me it was simple and easy to grasp compared to all the stuff math professors where putting in our heads with a comment of ""you can't be a good programmer if you don't know the math"". Sure you can, easy!

I now know the mathematical stuff, so that I can talk with math-background programmers with all the log's differentials and stuff, but only for the reason so that they wouldn't faint. Because that stuff is useless 99.9% of the time, and when it is, it can be learned 1000x more effectively from programmers viewpoint.

Heck, programmers need at least 5 years to master a programming language+frameworks+best practices. Why on earth they should learn how to prove the theorems? Math student's do the math stuff, programmers get that stuff running, that's how it should work.

I only came up with a total of 22 amps, absolute max draw. US standard 110V.

I did the math but I wasn't able to crack our normal $150 / month (calculated out using the local kilowatt hour pricing).

What the heck is going on? Anything more for me to do before calling the electrician?

Edit:

The meter box is mounted to the side of the house, under a overhang.

When I used the ammeter I was working off the main hot line from the meter when I powered everything up. 

I did see the other diy post. 

We do have central air, howeverit was a lot cooler last month vs the same time last year. The usage shouldnt have spiked, at least that much.

The price per killowatt hour is comperable to last year as well.

We generally clock in at around 1200 to 1800 kilowatt hours. Last month was a bit over 2800.

We already tried (unsuccessfully) to lodge a complaint with the electric company.

The odd thing is the variance -$150 one month and near $1000 the next, with no noticible change in utilization patterns.

In cases like this you do not call an electrician, you call the utility that billed you. They take high bill complaints very seriously, at least around here they do (NY State).

We generally clock in at around 1200 to 1800 kilowatt hours. Last month was a bit over 2800.

We already tried (unsuccessfully) to lodge a complaint with the electric company.

The odd thing is the variance -$150 one month and near $1000 the next, with no noticible change in utilization patterns.
","First off, you are not billed by the city, you are billed by the electric utility. Unless you're in Canada and then I'm not sure.

In cases like this you do not call an electrician, you call the utility that billed you. They take high bill complaints very seriously, at least around here they do (NY State). 
They will do what is necessary to find out what the problem is. If it does happen to be on your end they'll tell you so.

5792,5792,9177,Finding out how host names are resolved,"I'm working on a network analysis tool (academic research), and I would like to find out what DNS is used on the machine the software is running on. I'm not a network admin, and I'm wondering: what's the easiest way to find that out; across platforms (that is, on each Linux, Mac and Windows), and preferably using something that's accessible in Python?

Usually, systems seem to conveniently hide this stuff from the user -- I can set a fixed DNS, or I can use my router's settings via DHCP, or ... I'm sure there are other systems too (LDAP?). So just looking at resolv.conf may not always lead to the right answer -- or does it?

344,344,549,Adding Properties to User Profile and Displaying in List,"I have a site that I am migrating to WordPress, and I have a need to add properties that each of the users can edit (e.g., Address, City, State, Business Name, etc), along with some properties that Administrators can edit (IsActive, CanEmail) that wouldn't be displayed to the user.  In addition, I need to be able to display the properties in a table (similar to how the plugin, ""Members List"", displays, but with the custom fields displaying as well.

Given these requirements, I had attempted to use a combination of ""Cimy User Extra Fields"" and ""Members List"", but the members list grid did not have an option to display the extra fields created by the other plugin.

How would you recommend I approach this?

EDIT: 

So I guess the crux of my question is, what is the preferred method to add properties to the User?
",Steve Wright,https://wordpress.stackexchange.com/users/1371,"To answer the first part of your question, I have just put my class TTT_User_Profile_Addon on GitHub. The class offers a simple interface to add a field to a profile page. I have added an example for a checkbox subclass and some code to initialize it per functions.php. This works in a plugin too, of course.

There are some build in placeholders, but you can add your own. Separate filters for the markup and input values make extending the class easier.

You can set custom capabilities for showing and saving the fields per constructor call. The whole work is reduced to a simple init function:

add_action( 'init', 'ttt_init_profile_addons' );

/**

A CAPTCHA is a type of challenge-response test used in computing to determine whether or not the user is human. (...) CAPTCHAs are used to prevent bots from using various types of computing services or collecting certain types of sensitive information. - Wikipedia

Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is a type of attack that occurs when a malicious Web site, email, blog, instant message, or program causes a user’s Web browser to perform an unwanted action on a trusted site for which the user is currently authenticated. - OWASP

As you've read, they are both completely different aspects of security. And both CAPTCHAs and CSRF prevention can be bad for the user experience if not implemented right (browser usability issues, hard to solve CAPTCHAs, etc).

I want to count how many type in the same bulan value, (e.g. there are 3 type = CHEESE1K, UHT, and ESL  in bulan = 4)

how to do that?
",blankon91,https://stackoverflow.com/users/1160352,"There's still a typo in your JSON: you've got two commas in a row between the first two ""bulan"":""6"" objects. But assuming you fix that...

If you're asking how to count distinct types for a particular bulan value you can do something like this:

function countTypesForBulan(resultArray, bulanVal) {
   var i,
       types,
       count = 0;
   for (i=0, types = {}; i &lt; resultArray.length; i++)
      if (resultArray[i].bulan === bulanVal &amp;&amp; !types[resultArray[i].type]) {
         types[resultArray[i].type] = true;
         count++;
      }
   return count;
}

console.log( countTypesForBulan(obj.GetReportIdResult, ""4"") );  // logs 3

","There's still a typo in your JSON: you've got two commas in a row between the first two ""bulan"":""6"" objects. But assuming you fix that...

If you're asking how to count distinct types for a particular bulan value you can do something like this:

function countTypesForBulan(resultArray, bulanVal) {
   var i,
       types,
       count = 0;
   for (i=0, types = {}; i &lt; resultArray.length; i++)
      if (resultArray[i].bulan === bulanVal &amp;&amp; !types[resultArray[i].type]) {
         types[resultArray[i].type] = true;
         count++;
      }
   return count;
}

console.log( countTypesForBulan(obj.GetReportIdResult, ""4"") );  // logs 3


The above loops through the array looking for a particular bulan value, and when it finds one it checks if it has already seen the associated type - if not, it adds it to the types object and increments the counter.

2660,2660,4233,call/cc implementation?,"I'm trying to find how call/cc is implemented. The best I've found is this Haskell snippet:

callCC f = Cont $ \k -&gt; runCont (f (\a -&gt; Cont $ \_ -&gt; k a)) k


Although this is not as simple as I want due to the Cont and runCont. I've also found descriptions of what it does, although never as clear as actual code.

So how is it implemented in its simplest form? I am tagging this with Scheme and Haskell as those are two languages I prefer.
",Pubby,https://stackoverflow.com/users/964135,"""Implementing call/cc"" doesn't really make sense at the layer you're working in; if you can implement call/cc in a language, that just means it has a built-in construct at least as powerful as call/cc. At the level of the language itself, call/cc is basically a primitive control flow operator, just like some form of branching must be.

Of course, you can implement a language with call/cc in a language without it; this is because it's at a lower level. You're translating the language's constructs in a specific manner, and you arrange this translation so that you can implement call/cc; i.e., generally, continuation-passing style (although for non-portable implementation in C, you can also just copy the stack directly; I'll cover continuation-passing style in more depth later). This does not really give any great insight into call/cc itself — the insight is into the model with which you make it possible. On top of that, call/cc is just a wrapper.

Now, Haskell does not expose a notion of a continuation; it would break referential transparency, and limit possible implementation strategies. Cont is implemented in Haskell, just like every other monad, and you can think of it as a model of a language with continuations using continuation-passing style, just like the list monad models nondeterminism.

Technically, that definition of callCC does type if you just remove the applications of Cont and runCont. But that won't help you understand how it works in the context of the Cont monad, so let's look at its definition instead. (This definition isn't the one used in the current Monad Transformer Library, because all of the monads in it are built on top of their transformer versions, but it matches the snippet's use of Cont (which only works with the older version), and simplifies things dramatically.)

newtype Cont r a = Cont { runCont :: (a -&gt; r) -&gt; r }


OK, so Cont r a is just (a -&gt; r) -&gt; r, and runCont lets us get this function out of a Cont r a value. Simple enough. But what does it mean?

Cont r a is a continuation-passing computation with final result r, and result a. What does final result mean? Well, let's write the type of runCont out more explicitly:

runCont :: Cont r a -&gt; (a -&gt; r) -&gt; r


So, as we can see, the ""final result"" is the value we get out of runCont at the end. Now, how can we build up computations with Cont? The monad instance is enlightening:

instance Monad (Cont r) where
  return a = Cont (\k -&gt; k a)
  m &gt;&gt;= f = Cont (\k -&gt; runCont m (\result -&gt; runCont (f result) k))


Well, okay, it's enlightening if you already know what it means. The key thing is that when you write Cont (\k -&gt; ...), k is the rest of the computation — it's expecting you to give it a value a, and will then give you the final result of the computation (of type r, remember) back, which you can then use as your own return value because your return type is r too. Whew! And when we run a Cont computation with runCont, we're simply specifying the final k — the ""top level"" of the computation that produces the final result.

What's this ""rest of the computation"" called? A continuation, because it's the continuation of the computation!

(&gt;&gt;=) is actually quite simple: we run the computation on the left, giving it our own rest-of-computation. This rest-of-computation just feeds the value into f, which produces its own computation. We run that computation, feeding it into the rest-of-computation that our combined action has been given. In this way, we can thread together computations in Cont:

computeFirst &gt;&gt;= \a -&gt;
computeSecond &gt;&gt;= \b -&gt;
return (a + b)


or, in the more familiar do notation:

do a &lt;- computeFirst
   b &lt;- computeSecond
   return (a + b)


We can then run these computations with runCont — most of the time, something like runCont foo id will work just fine, turning a foo with the same result and final result type into its result.

So far, so good. Now let's make things confusing.

wtf :: Cont String Int
wtf = Cont (\k -&gt; ""eek!"")

aargh :: Cont String Int
aargh = do
  a &lt;- return 1
  b &lt;- wtf
  c &lt;- return 2
  return (a + b + c)


What's going on here?! wtf is a Cont computation with final result String and result Int, but there's no Int in sight.

What happens when we run aargh, say with runCont aargh show — i.e., run the computation, and show its Int result as a String to produce the final result?

We get ""eek!"" back.

Remember how k is the ""rest of the computation""? What we've done in wtf is cunningly not call it, and instead supply our own final result — which then becomes, well, final!

This is just the first thing continuations can do. Something like Cont (\k -&gt; k 1 + k 2) runs the rest of the computation as if it returned 1, and again as if it returned 2, and adds the two final results together! Continuations basically allow expressing arbitrarily complex non-local control flow, making them as powerful as they are confusing. Indeed, continuations are so general that, in a sense, every monad is a special case of Cont. Indeed, you can think of (&gt;&gt;=) in general as using a kind of continuation-passing style:

(&gt;&gt;=) :: (Monad m) =&gt; m a -&gt; (a -&gt; m b) -&gt; m b


The second argument is a continuation taking the result of the first computation and returning the rest of the computation to be run.

But I still haven't answered the question: what's going on with that callCC? Well, it calls the function you give with the current continuation. But hang on a second, isn't that what we were doing with Cont already? Yes, but compare the types:

Cont   :: ((a -&gt; r)        -&gt; r)        -&gt; Cont r a
callCC :: ((a -&gt; Cont r b) -&gt; Cont r a) -&gt; Cont r a


Huh. You see, the problem with Cont is that we can't sequence actions from inside of the function we pass — we're just producing an r result in a pure manner. callCC lets the continuation be accessed, passed around, and just generally be messed around with from inside Cont computations. When we have

do a &lt;- callCC (\cc -&gt; ...)
   foo ...


You can imagine cc being a function we can call with any value inside the function to make that the return value of callCC (\cc -&gt; ...) computation itself. Or, of course, we could just return a value normally, but then calling callCC in the first place would be a little pointless :)

As for the mysterious b there, it's just because you can use cc foo to stand in for a computation of any type you want, since it escapes the normal control flow and, like I said, immediately uses that as the result of the entire callCC (\cc -&gt; ...). So since it never has to actually produce a value, it can get away with returning a value of any type it wants. Sneaky!

Which brings us to the actual implementation:

callCC f = Cont (\k -&gt; runCont (f (\a -&gt; Cont (\_ -&gt; k a))) k)


First, we get the entire rest of the computation, and call it k. But what's this f (\a -&gt; Cont (\_ -&gt; k a)) part about? Well, we know that f takes a value of type (a -&gt; Cont r b), and that's what the lambda is — a function that takes a value to use as the result of the callCC f, and returns a Cont computation that ignores its continuation and just returns that value through k — the ""rest of the computation"" from the perspective of callCC f. OK, so the result of that f call is another Cont computation, which we'll need to supply a continuation to in order to run. We just pass the same continuation again since, if everything goes normally, we want whatever the computation returns to be our return value and continue on normally. (Indeed, passing another value wouldn't make sense — it's ""call with current continuation"", not ""call with a continuation other than the one you're actually running me with"".)

All in all, I hope you found this as enlightening as it is long. Continuations are very powerful, but it can take a lot of time to get an intuition for how they work. I suggest playing around with Cont (which you'll have to call cont to get things working with the current mtl) and working out how you get the results you do to get a feel for the control flow.

(Indeed, passing another value wouldn't make sense — it's ""call with current continuation"", not ""call with a continuation other than the one you're actually running me with"".)

All in all, I hope you found this as enlightening as it is long. Continuations are very powerful, but it can take a lot of time to get an intuition for how they work. I suggest playing around with Cont (which you'll have to call cont to get things working with the current mtl) and working out how you get the results you do to get a feel for the control flow.

4198,4198,6693,"Control Fields vs Heap ""Mock"" Fields for Branching Trigger Behavior","I've seen solutions that talk about adding control fields to allow for clever trigger branching in problems like this. I know that works, but it annoys me (feels architecturally wrong) to create such fields if it can be avoided. I've also seen solutions that have to do with using static variables for a similar purpose, but I have found occasions where one global flag is not good enough because I need the flag per record. I've tried both out and I think I want something in the middle. Something like this:

global without sharing class HeapControl {

        system.assert(HeapControl.IsRecordTagged(a.Id, 'Control-Field-Name-1'));
    }

I'd like a pro-con analysis of using real control fields vs mock control fields on the heap (doesn't have to be my code, anything along the lines of static Map&lt;Id, ...&gt;, if you know of a field-tested version of this code please share). 

In my not-yet-field-tested opinion, the control field concept evolved out of a workflow world, but once you decide to drop down to triggers the heap will serve you better--at least you don't have to create control fields for every little trigger branch.

I apologize this isn't standard Q&amp;A format--but this issue has been burning in my mind for months now and I think there are a lot of Salesforce developers (writing business process triggers in particular) that wrestle with this regularly. Thanks in advance for sharing your wisdom and experience!
",twamley,https://salesforce.stackexchange.com/users/773,"Good quesiton, but what is the real question? The key phrase from your question for me is 'business process triggers'. If I may, I think the discussion needs to start from a application layering perspective, or put more specifically 'where do we put our business process logic?'. Before I get on to that let me say this about triggers...

The thing about triggers is... they respond to data centric actions, period. If you view the top to bottom architecture of your Force.com application, its easy to forget your still dealing with the database tier when writing code at the trigger level. If you look at the rich level of API support and an native UI around this database tier. You will soon realise your effectively developing an app on a database schema that is by default open, like it or not. You have to service this way of interacting with your app. Take Salesforce Touch for example, this provides your clients a rich mobile/tablet client for free! Then the new REST API, the list goes on. You only get the benefit of these if you embrace letting your customers / developers access this tier safely and clearly (so good database design is even more important ironically). So when you look at it from this angle, its important to consider carefully any requirements that lead to design patterns, validation rules etc that might impact the use of your 'open database tier'. And don't get me wrong, there are some good reasons to, but you must design firstly for things to be open and discuss carefully what the implications are of over complicating or closing off parts of your database schema interaction.

So that all sounds good, but why do I still find it hard sometimes to implement what I want? Well, if your application is typically ""data centric"" in its purpose, you'll generally have an easier job. A user interactions, much like Salesforce CRM, are typically tasks surrounding the scope and lifetime of individual records. So triggers, layouts, record types really start to come into their own here. But if you have an application that is in part 'data centric' (for standing / master data) and part 'process/task centric' where does that leave you? Enter SOA...

Service Orientated Architecture and Control Fields? Unless you're solely a data centric application. Your going to have to find a place for your clients (and by 'clients' I am not just talking about human consumers here) to consume / access your business process logic. Having them tweak Control Fields at your schema level may make sense and there is scope for it, if you can work it nicely into the schema. But over use of it, along with having your clients dependent on a deeper understanding of your schema. Will introduce voodoo into your schema and increase the barrier to entry for your application interactions, developer, end user or platform wise. So to avoid users poking around trying to reverse engineer your VF logic, control fields, why not consider exposing a service layer in your applications for such logic? 

So how do I do that then? REST has recently taken hold over Web Services, primarily because of the aforementioned 'barrier to entry'. It is easy to document and if done correctly is self describing, much like the 'data centric' aspects of your application utilising Custom Objects. So for business proceses, for me REST (I include JavaScript Remoting in this) gets my vote for exposing business process logic to your clients (be they human or machine). If you adhere strictly to this approach (which requires a SOA based design process for your app) then you'll end up with a rich set of API's for you and your clients to consume. Which in this day and age of Cloud computing is pretty much a must! So while you might argue this is not strictly SOA (as yes Salesforce does handle a lot of the mechanics with oAuth etc). I feel there is room for taking a SOA based design and architecture approach to designing Force.com applications.

So OK, how would I implement the code in the question above? Developing a generic Apex solution is really a solution for a problem that I don't think should be solved generically or at the Apex level (see my thoughts below). Generally to much of this approach is teaching your database tier code
about the business processes that should be implemented above it. You should let your business process tier do the driving and expose that as a service for your clients / callers to consume (in addition to those already provided by Salesforce btw!). The trick then is marketing and supporting the strict design, development and consumption internally (for your own client developers, be they VF, mobile or otherwise) and externally of them. Again don't get me wrong we should absolutely fill our triggers with great value add logic, but it should know its place.

Control Fields : Heap vs Custom Field : That said, when taking the Control Field approach, and as I describe above is valid, when it 'fits' with your schema and thus API / native UI experience sensibly. When implementing it I am in favour in the first instance of designing it in into the application schema as a field. This way everyone knows whats going on. Again the schema is open and not declaring it (by managing internally) only leads to frustration, low barrier to entry due to higher complexity (internally and externally). I've also been burnt a few times with Static, initialisation and state carry over, while I'm not 100% sure, for example, I think Batch Apex serialises statics over 'execute' invocations, which can catch you out at times.

Application Enterprise Patterns on Force.com

Here is a diagram i presented at a recent Dreamforce session about Enterprise Application patterns. The sessions slides takes a simple scenario and walks through, what might be described as a 'consolidated' or 'merged' approach typically seen when people start out or smaller applications, and again this approach has its place as well. What I followed this in my session with was a more layered approach using some Application Enterprise patterns along the way. I'm pleased to say it got quite a good reception and has since generated a steady stream of interest (I've got a draft blog posting on it in the working btw). You can find the Github repo here, with more info on the patterns. The slides are here.



NOTE: That Trigger invocation is not shown here, the SObjectDomain class takes care of routing the CRUD events from the triggers to the 'Domain' classes representing the Standard or Custom Object behaviour your application is implementing. This pattern enforces development of appropriate logic for this context. Leaving the Service layer to doing any process level orchestration.

The sessions slides takes a simple scenario and walks through, what might be described as a 'consolidated' or 'merged' approach typically seen when people start out or smaller applications, and again this approach has its place as well. What I followed this in my session with was a more layered approach using some Application Enterprise patterns along the way. I'm pleased to say it got quite a good reception and has since generated a steady stream of interest (I've got a draft blog posting on it in the working btw). You can find the Github repo here, with more info on the patterns. The slides are here.



NOTE: That Trigger invocation is not shown here, the SObjectDomain class takes care of routing the CRUD events from the triggers to the 'Domain' classes representing the Standard or Custom Object behaviour your application is implementing. This pattern enforces development of appropriate logic for this context. Leaving the Service layer to doing any process level orchestration.

",Jeff Axelrod,https://cooking.stackexchange.com/users/2690,"From the point of view of someone who used to work in a Chinese restaurant, we used to prepare vermicelli which are really thin rice noodles by soaking the uncooked dry noodles in cold water for about 1 hour or until it is flexible.

To cook it, we just submerge it in boiling water for about a minute and then prepare it however we need it. With the soak it takes practically no time to cook at all.

",Samaursa,https://stackoverflow.com/users/368599,"difference_type usually denotes the type suitable to denote a distance in an array or similar. The following wording is from the allocator requirements, but whenever the standard talks about difference_type it means the same concept:


  a type that can represent the difference between any two pointers in

The natural type for this is ptrdiff_t.

For the size_type it says:


  a type that can represent the size of the largest object in the
  allocation model.


The natural type here is size_t.

Now for the count of any elements in a range (or an array) does need at least the type suitable to specify the difference last-first. It seems most natural to chose that one.

EDIT: So far there is no suitable answer as to why the function returns ptrdiff_t. Some explanation gathered from the answers below is that the return type is iterator_traits&lt;InputIterator&gt;::difference_type which is generic and can be anything. Up until that point it makes sense. There are cases where the count may exceed size_t. However, it still does not make sense why the return type is typedef ptrdiff_t iterator_traits&lt;InputIterator&gt;::difference_type for the standard iterators instead of typedef size_t iterator_traits&lt;InputIterator&gt;::difference_type.
","difference_type usually denotes the type suitable to denote a distance in an array or similar. The following wording is from the allocator requirements, but whenever the standard talks about difference_type it means the same concept:


  a type that can represent the difference between any two pointers in
  the allocation model


The natural type for this is ptrdiff_t.

For the size_type it says:


  a type that can represent the size of the largest object in the
  allocation model.


The natural type here is size_t.

Now for the count of any elements in a range (or an array) does need at least the type suitable to specify the difference last-first. It seems most natural to chose that one.

5770,5770,9146,Seperation of drawing and logic in games,"I'm a developer that's just now starting to mess around with game development. I'm a .Net guy, so I've messed with XNA and am now playing around with Cocos2d for the iPhone. My question really is more general though. 

Let's say I'm building a simple Pong game. I'd have a Ball class and a Paddle class. Coming from the business world development, my first instinct is to not have any drawing or input handling code in either of these classes.

//pseudo code
class Ball
{
   Vector2D position;
   Vector2D velocity;
   Color color;
   void Move(){}
}


Nothing in the ball class handles input, or deals with drawing. I'd then have another class, my Game class, or my Scene.m (in Cocos2D) which would new up the Ball, and during the game loop, it would manipulate the ball as needed.

The thing is though, in many tutorials for both XNA and Cocos2D, I see a pattern like this:

//pseudo code
class Ball : SomeUpdatableComponent
{
   Vector2D position;
   Vector2D velocity;
   Color color;
   void Update(){}
   void Draw(){}
   void HandleInput(){}
}


My question is, is this right? Is this the pattern that people use in game development? It somehow goes against everything I'm used to, to have my Ball class do everything. Furthermore, in this second example, where my Ball knows how to move around, how would I handle collision detection with the Paddle? Would the Ball need to have knowledge of the Paddle? In my first example, the Game class would have references to both the Ball and the Paddle, and then ship both of those off to some CollisionDetection manager or something, but how do I deal with the complexity of various components, if each individual component does everything themselves?

",BFree,https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/users/4911,"I recently made a simple Space Invadors game using an 'entity system'.  It's a pattern that separates attributes and behaviours extremely well.  It took me a few iterations to fully understand it, but once you get a few components designed it becomes extremely simples to compose new objects using your existing components.

You should read this:

http://t-machine.org/index.php/2007/09/03/entity-systems-are-the-future-of-mmog-development-part-1/

It's updated frequently by an extremely knowledgable guy.  It's also the only entity system discussion with concrete code examples.

My iterations went as follows:

The first iteration had an ""EntitySystem"" object which was as Adam describes; however my components still had methods- my 'renderable' component had a paint() method, and my position component had a move() method and etc.  When I began to flesh out the entities I realized that I needed to start passing message between components and ordering the execution of components updates....way too messy.

So, I went back and re-read T-machines blog.  There is a lot of information in the comment threads- and in them he really emphasizes that components do not have behaviours- behaviours are provided by the entity systems.  In this way you do not need to pass messages between components and order component updates because the ordering is determined by the global order of system execution.  Ok.  Maybe that's too abstract.

Anyway for iteration #2 this is what I gleaned from the blog:

EntityManager - acts as the component ""database"", which can be queried for entities which contain certain types of components.  This can even be backed by an in-memory database for speedy access...see t-machine part 5 for more info.

EntitySystem - Each system is essentially just a method which operates on a set of entites.  Each system will use component x,y and z of an entity to get it's work done.  So you would query the manager for entities with components x,y and z then pass that result to the system.

Entity - just an id, like a long.  The entity is what groups a set of components instances together into an 'entity'.

Component - a set of fields....no behaviours!  when you start adding behaviours it starts to get messy...even in a simple Space Invadors game.

Edit: by the way, 'dt' is the delta time since the last main loop invocation

So my main Invadors loop is this:

Collection&lt;Entity&gt; entitiesWithGuns = manager.getEntitiesWith(Gun.class);
Collection&lt;Entity&gt; entitiesWithDamagable =
manager.getEntitiesWith(BulletDamagable.class);
Collection&lt;Entity&gt; entitiesWithInvadorDamagable = manager.getEntitiesWith(InvadorDamagable.class);

keyboardShipControllerSystem.update(entitiesWithGuns, dt);
touchInputSystem.update(entitiesWithGuns, dt);
Collection&lt;Entity&gt; entitiesWithInvadorMovement = manager.getEntitiesWith(InvadorMovement.class);
invadorMovementSystem.update(entitiesWithInvadorMovement);

Collection&lt;Entity&gt; entitiesWithVelocity = manager.getEntitiesWith(Velocity.class);
movementSystem.move(entitiesWithVelocity, dt);
gunSystem.update(entitiesWithGuns, System.currentTimeMillis());
Collection&lt;Entity&gt; entitiesWithPositionAndForm = manager.getEntitiesWith(Position.class, Form.class);
collisionSystem.checkCollisions(entitiesWithPositionAndForm);


It looks a little weird at first, but it's incredibly flexible.  It's also very easy to optimize; for different component types you can have different backing datastores to make retrieval faster.  For the 'form' class you can have it backed with a quadtree to speed access for collision detection.

I'm like you; I'm a seasoned developer but had no experience writing games.  I spent a some time researching gave dev patterns, and this one caught my eye.  It is in no way the only way to do things, but I've found it very intuitive and robust.  I believe the pattern was officially discussed in book 6 of the series ""Game Programming Gems"" - http://www.amazon.com/Game-Programming-Gems/dp/1584500492.  I haven't read any of the books myself but I hear they are the de-facto reference for game programming.

I believe the two queries need to be something like the following:

'""friends"":""SELECT uid,current_location FROM user WHERE uid IN (SELECT uid2 FROM friend WHERE uid1 = me())""'

'""location"":""SELECT location FROM page WHERE id IN (SELECT current_location_id FROM #friends)""';


My problem is that somehow I need to get the ID of the current_location in the first query so that I can reference it in the second query, but I only know how to get an array that contains the id.

Thanks for any help!

Clarification:

I'm not trying to get check-ins of friends.  Instead I want to graph the ""current_location"" (i.e. where they live) of all of a user's friends on a Geo map.  I can get a user's ""current_location"" with the following FQL query:

""SELECT uid,sex,current_location FROM user WHERE uid IN (SELECT uid2 FROM friend WHERE uid1 = me())""


This query returns the following array:

[current_location] =&gt; Array

""SELECT location,name FROM page WHERE page_id = 108424279189115)""


To get the latitude and longitude of the current_location.  Currently, I have a working code that runs the first FQL query, then extracts page_id in php, and then runs a second FQL query to get the current_location latitude/longitude.  However, for performance reasons I would like to run only one multi-query if this is possible.

1584,1584,2492,Is it ethical to profit by having my students buy my textbook?,"This question was suggested to me by How can I sell my text book to my students in e-book format? which asked about the practicalities, but attracted many comments about the ethics.  So this question is to ask about the ethics directly.

Suppose I have written and published a textbook, and I want to use it as the text for a course I am teaching.  I receive royalties from each copy of my book that is sold, so if my students are required to buy my textbook for the course, I will make some money.  Is it ethical to do so?

Well-reasoned opinions would be useful answers, but even more useful would be pointers to institutional policies, professional codes of ethics, etc, that address this issue.

Of course, there are many ways to avoid profiting from the sale of my book to my students.  If my contract with my publisher allows it, I could distribute PDFs to my students, or have the university bookstore print out copies and sell them at cost.  Another approach I've heard of is to compute how much I earn in royalties on each copy, and refund that amount from my pocket to each student who buys a copy.  Or, use my royalty earnings to buy pizza for the class.  Certainly these are nice gestures, but I would like opinions on whether they are ethically required.

Edit: To address some questions that have arisen in the comments:


This question is hypothetical.  I haven't published any textbooks myself and have no immediate plans to do so.  In any case, my personal preference would be to make the book available to students for free, if at all possible.  So I've phrased this question in the first person for rhetorical convenience only.
I had intended the question to be only about the potential financial conflict of interest that could arise if I make money by assigning my own book.  Some of the answers feel that it is improper for me to assign my own textbook at all, whether I make money or not, but I don't think this point of view is prevalent within the academic community.  If it happens that my book (as a pithy but now-deleted comment put it) ""blows"", I think most would agree that my decision to assign it is pedagogically unfortunate, but not unethical.  
I don't literally mean that students would be required to buy the book, only that they'd be expected to have it.  I might assign readings or homework problems from the book, so that the student needs access to the book in order to do them, but they could certainly achieve this by getting a used copy or borrowing from a friend.  But probably most students would buy new copies anyway, since that is the most convenient way.

",Nate Eldredge,https://academia.stackexchange.com/users/1010,"One arrangement with the publisher of my two ""text""-books was that the price be reduced by the amount of the otherwise-royalty for any books sold through the university bookstore, so that, in effect, I was not collecting royalties from students at this university (whether or not I was the instructor).

Suppose I have written and published a textbook, and I want to use it as the text for a course I am teaching.  I receive royalties from each copy of my book that is sold, so if my students are required to buy my textbook for the course, I will make some money.  Is it ethical to do so?

Well-reasoned opinions would be useful answers, but even more useful would be pointers to institutional policies, professional codes of ethics, etc, that address this issue.

Of course, there are many ways to avoid profiting from the sale of my book to my students.  If my contract with my publisher allows it, I could distribute PDFs to my students, or have the university bookstore print out copies and sell them at cost.  Another approach I've heard of is to compute how much I earn in royalties on each copy, and refund that amount from my pocket to each student who buys a copy.  Or, use my royalty earnings to buy pizza for the class.  Certainly these are nice gestures, but I would like opinions on whether they are ethically required.

Edit: To address some questions that have arisen in the comments:


This question is hypothetical.  I haven't published any textbooks myself and have no immediate plans to do so.  In any case, my personal preference would be to make the book available to students for free, if at all possible.  So I've phrased this question in the first person for rhetorical convenience only.
I had intended the question to be only about the potential financial conflict of interest that could arise if I make money by assigning my own book.  Some of the answers feel that it is improper for me to assign my own textbook at all, whether I make money or not, but I don't think this point of view is prevalent within the academic community.  If it happens that my book (as a pithy but now-deleted comment put it) ""blows"", I think most would agree that my decision to assign it is pedagogically unfortunate, but not unethical.  
I don't literally mean that students would be required to buy the book, only that they'd be expected to have it.  I might assign readings or homework problems from the book, so that the student needs access to the book in order to do them, but they could certainly achieve this by getting a used copy or borrowing from a friend.  But probably most students would buy new copies anyway, since that is the most convenient way.

","One arrangement with the publisher of my two ""text""-books was that the price be reduced by the amount of the otherwise-royalty for any books sold through the university bookstore, so that, in effect, I was not collecting royalties from students at this university (whether or not I was the instructor).

Another aspect is making printouts from PDFs available at-cost to students at this university, which is what my contract with the publisher specifically allowed in one case.

The \@ifpackageloaded takes two arguments: what to do if the package is loaded or not. Your \if doesn't really do anything.

Now the problem is that if the package is not loaded, then the macro \qw does not get defined. Something like this might be what you want

",Rory,https://programmers.stackexchange.com/users/48536,"Simple answer; Math makes you fast. Sure, you can google/se/wikipedia your coding problems away, but get enough math done and you won't need to. Believe it or not, the properly trained human brain is faster than google. Moreover the more math you know the faster you will be able to understand the results google/se/wiki gives you, and the less you'll need to drill down to understand what people tell you. In the process of solving your programming problems you'll end up learning math anyway but if you focus on math it will be a far more efficient process.

Your question is kind of like a rock musician asking why they would need formal musical training. Is it possible to be successful without it? Sure. Does it make you much more of a badass if you do go with it? Absolutely.

Slightly more complicated answer - When mathematicians and programmers use the word ""solution"" (for problems, that is, not equations - ie not ""roots"") - they mean pretty much the same thing. Learning to solve math problems helps you to learn to solve programming problems.

1955,1955,3114,Caucasus: end overland trip where I started without retracing my steps,"I'm looking into a Caucasus trip visiting Turkey, Georgia and Armenia. A return flight from IST is far cheaper than a multi-city flight, so I'd like to get back to Istanbul without going over the same route I came in (through Georgia, which as I understand seems to be the only way to get to Armenia from Turkey)

Given local neighbour relations, what path can I take that includes all three but doesn't repeat any part of the journey ?

To return from Armenia, I see two equally unreliable options: 


Getting an Azerbaijan transit visa and crossing Naxchivan, but the Armenia-Azerbaijan border is apparently closed, and I'm afraid an Armenian stamp in my passport could complicate this passage. The Armenia-Azerbaijan border is closed, so that settles this issue.

Then I decided to dig deeper and found a dozens of listeners (locale listeners, exception liteners, ...) and tried to debug/fix/test there, but I didn't proceed any further.

By the way, I have overrided the 500 error page too, and everything is fine there. Well I guess that when 500 error (exception) is thrown, the symfony has already set up user/locale/etc, because it already has got to the target (controller/action) and other listeners been already executed. But 404 error (NotFoundHttpException) is being thrown BEFORE Symfony targets the action...

Some words about project: symfony 2.4.8, doctrine, Gedmo extensions/stof bundle, JMS i18n routing bundle.

Symfony version: v2.4.8
JMS I18n Routing bundle: 1.1.1

The problem is with the overrided Twig 404 template. It is overrided in a default way by creating an error404.html.twig under the /app/Resources/TwigBundle/views directory.

The template itself does not contain any irregular or complex logic: just a layout with some translated text (|trans) and a menu with several links.

5822,5822,9226,sleeping SPID blocking other transactions,"I'm really having trouble tracking down some blocking we are experiencing.

The root blocking SPID's status is 'sleeping', the cmd is 'AWAITING COMMAND', and the sqltext is 'SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ COMMITTED'.

When I view the Top Transactions by Blocked Transactions Count report, the Blocking SQL Statement is '--'.

I've performed a trace on the SQL and when the blocking happens tracing the root blocking SPID but it hasn't really led me anywhere.  The last trace statement is the same as the sqltext above 'SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ COMMITTED'.

I've checked all the related SPROCs I can find to make sure they have TRY/CATCH BEGIN TRAN/COMMIT TRAN/ROLLBACK TRAN statements (we use SPROCs for everything so there are no standalone statements being ran).  This issue just started happening over the last 24 hours and no one is claiming to have made any changes to the system.

Solution.  One of our seldomly used SPROCs had an error with an insert (number of columns didn't match), but we are still confused on what exactly was happening.

When looking at all the trace information, the EXEC statement for this SPROC was listed at times, but NEVER just before the BLOCK happened on the blockking SPID.  It seemed that when it starting blocking, the trace didn't record the execution of it (or any of the statements within it either).  However there are other times were the trace did record it's execution and no blocking occurred.

The SPROC error report came from a user, and I was able to find multiple EXEC statements in traces and run them in SSMS.  No time when I ran them did we have any blocking occur or did they hang.  They ran as expected (the catch block fired and rolled back the transaction after the error).  After resolving the fixing the SPROC, we have not seen the issue again.
",Brad,https://dba.stackexchange.com/users/10561,"From comments, I'm guessing you had a client side Command timeout that has aborted the SQL query. This does not rollback the transaction because the connection stays open on SQL Server due to connection pooling.

668,668,1059,What is the case for interpreting the Genesis creation account literally?,"I think we can all agree that the entire Bible is not meant to be taken literally.  Consider the Song of Solomon (what would his lover look like if we take it literally?) or the book of Revelation.

So I would like to understand the case for believing the Genesis creation account, among all Biblical texts, is one that is intended to be interpreted literally. I'm not interested in scientific evidence for a young-earth in these answers. I'm interested in Biblical or historical reasons why this text, as a whole (as opposed to individual words), should be considered literal.

I would also discourage answers that address specific words in the Genesis account (such as the Hebrew 'yom'), but if that is the strongest evidence you have, then I won't consider it an invalid answer.
",Flimzy,https://christianity.stackexchange.com/users/20,"The short version is that there are many places in the Bible that quote/reference the creation account in the book of Genesis literally (Exodus 16:16, Exodus 20:11, Exodus 31:17, Leviticus 23:3, Deuteronomy 5:13, Luke 13:14, etc).

The most obvious is the ""reasoning"" given for the 4th Commandment:


  Six days you shall labor and do all your work, but the seventh day is a sabbath of the LORD your God .. For in six days the LORD made the heavens and the earth, the sea and all that is in them, and rested on the seventh day


Furthermore, death was not introduced into creation until Adam sinned (Genesis 3:17-19, Romans 5:12, 8:20-22). Without death, you cannot have fossils.

The first of the genealogies of the Bible, which starts with the first man (Adam) and goes through Noah, is given in concrete years of the age of the father when the son was born.

Consider the Song of Solomon (what would his lover look like if we take it literally?) or the book of Revelation.

So I would like to understand the case for believing the Genesis creation account, among all Biblical texts, is one that is intended to be interpreted literally. I'm not interested in scientific evidence for a young-earth in these answers. I'm interested in Biblical or historical reasons why this text, as a whole (as opposed to individual words), should be considered literal.

I would also discourage answers that address specific words in the Genesis account (such as the Hebrew 'yom'), but if that is the strongest evidence you have, then I won't consider it an invalid answer.
","The short version is that there are many places in the Bible that quote/reference the creation account in the book of Genesis literally (Exodus 16:16, Exodus 20:11, Exodus 31:17, Leviticus 23:3, Deuteronomy 5:13, Luke 13:14, etc).

The most obvious is the ""reasoning"" given for the 4th Commandment:


  Six days you shall labor and do all your work, but the seventh day is a sabbath of the LORD your God .. For in six days the LORD made the heavens and the earth, the sea and all that is in them, and rested on the seventh day


Furthermore, death was not introduced into creation until Adam sinned (Genesis 3:17-19, Romans 5:12, 8:20-22). Without death, you cannot have fossils.

The first of the genealogies of the Bible, which starts with the first man (Adam) and goes through Noah, is given in concrete years of the age of the father when the son was born. While I suppose you could elect to say that the first 5 days of creation were figurative, certainly from day 6 on is distinctly not figurative - otherwise the reckoning of Adam's age at the birth of Seth would be irrational.

The generic file type icons displayed in the Photos app really puzzled me, but a lot of Internet searching finally led to the solution: any installation of a recent version of the open source office suite ""LibreOffice"" changes the Windows registry of common graphics file types in an undesirable way, so that they are treated as a document rather than a picture.

",321,https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/40348,"Okay, here's a simple explanation:

You can consider a non-parallel plate capacitor as multiple parallel plate conductors, connected in parallel, with the distance between them increasing slightly for each capacitor.

You get the net capacitance as the average of the minimum capacitance (based on the minimum distance b/w the plates) and maximum capcitance (based on the maximum distance b/w the plates) if the plates are flat. If they aren't flat, you need to integrate over the surface of the plates.

1027,1027,1618,Is there any significant ranking penalty for using 302 redirects to force HTTPS?,"We have a site with:


Decent ranking on certain targeted keywords.
An HTTPS-only policy, which uses 302 redirects to force clients onto the secure version of any URL.
Internal links using HTTPS, so there is no redirection.
Some, but not all, external links from other domains use HTTPS. The rest do not and will of course be subject to the 302.
Google is only indexing the HTTPS version of each URL. Even if you search specifically for the HTTP URL, only the HTTPS URL is shown in the results.


Will there be any significant, immediate ranking benefit to changing our site to use 301 redirects to enforce HTTPS? Are there any statements from Google, Matt Cutts or other authorities on this specific situation?

Based on my research the difference should be minimal since we are already well indexed, and our internal links are fine, so Google is not going to apply a sitewide penalty for the 302s, which are, in effect, only the first link in the chain.
",Jordan Rieger,https://webmasters.stackexchange.com/users/27841,"The problem with 302 redirects are that they are temporary, which often results in both pages being indexed in Google - The page you are redirecting from and the page you are redirecting to. If both pages are indexed in Google then that is problem as you have a duplicate page indexed.

As mentioned here: Google's page on HTTP status codes 


  302 (Moved temporarily). This code is similar to a 301 in that for a GET or HEAD request, it
  automatically forwards the requestor to a different location, but you
  shouldn't use it to tell the Googlebot that a page or site has moved
  because Googlebot will continue to crawl and index the original
  location.


So although you mention all your internal linking will use https, but external links inevitably will be with http, so Google is going to find some http links and 302 redirects, which could result in duplicate pages being indexed.

Here is video from Matt Cutts where he attempts to answer the question weather there are problems ranking sites that use https. Although he doesn't mention your question specifically, he does touch on the point that if doing this correctly, you should be using 301 redirects.

Can switching to HTTPS harm ranking? 

So to summarise you should not be using 302 redirects to force http, you should be using 301 redirects.

Internal links using HTTPS, so there is no redirection.
Some, but not all, external links from other domains use HTTPS. The rest do not and will of course be subject to the 302.
Google is only indexing the HTTPS version of each URL. Even if you search specifically for the HTTP URL, only the HTTPS URL is shown in the results.


Will there be any significant, immediate ranking benefit to changing our site to use 301 redirects to enforce HTTPS? Are there any statements from Google, Matt Cutts or other authorities on this specific situation?

Based on my research the difference should be minimal since we are already well indexed, and our internal links are fine, so Google is not going to apply a sitewide penalty for the 302s, which are, in effect, only the first link in the chain.
","The problem with 302 redirects are that they are temporary, which often results in both pages being indexed in Google - The page you are redirecting from and the page you are redirecting to. If both pages are indexed in Google then that is problem as you have a duplicate page indexed.

As mentioned here: Google's page on HTTP status codes 


  302 (Moved temporarily). This code is similar to a 301 in that for a GET or HEAD request, it
  automatically forwards the requestor to a different location, but you
  shouldn't use it to tell the Googlebot that a page or site has moved
  because Googlebot will continue to crawl and index the original
  location.


So although you mention all your internal linking will use https, but external links inevitably will be with http, so Google is going to find some http links and 302 redirects, which could result in duplicate pages being indexed.

Here is video from Matt Cutts where he attempts to answer the question weather there are problems ranking sites that use https. Although he doesn't mention your question specifically, he does touch on the point that if doing this correctly, you should be using 301 redirects.

Can switching to HTTPS harm ranking? 

So to summarise you should not be using 302 redirects to force http, you should be using 301 redirects.

I'm not a network admin, and I'm wondering: what's the easiest way to find that out; across platforms (that is, on each Linux, Mac and Windows), and preferably using something that's accessible in Python?

Usually, systems seem to conveniently hide this stuff from the user -- I can set a fixed DNS, or I can use my router's settings via DHCP, or ... I'm sure there are other systems too (LDAP?). So just looking at resolv.conf may not always lead to the right answer -- or does it?

Many thanks!

Since the various Regional Finals, however, I've begun to encounter support Zyras in my bot lane.

This is a very difficult lane for me. I can't establish lane dominance, since Zyra just sits in her bush and puts seeds in mine. I've tried a rune page with flat MR for when I play against Zyra to counter some of her harass, but it doesn't help against her cc.

The problem is that we cannot necessarily choose from every fiber of $f$, so we cannot construct an injection from $A$ to $f^{-1}(A\times\lbrace 0\rbrace)$, which will prove the assertion.

",Asaf Karagila,https://mathoverflow.net/users/7206,"This is only a partial answer, but it's way too long to go in the comments.  I'll describe a permutation model (of ZF with atoms) that seems to give a counterexample $A$ for your statement.  It will be easy to see that $A$ maps onto $A\times2$, but I haven't proved that there's no bijection between $A$ and $A\times2$; all I can say is that it looks quite plausible.  If the example is correct, it will automatically transfer to ZF (without atoms) by the Jech-Sochor theorem.  So here's the model.

Start with a set $U$ of atoms in 1-1 correspondence with the product $2^\omega\times3$ of the Cantor set and the ordinal 3.  I'll write [x,i] for the atom that corresponds to the pair $(x,i)$, where $x\in2^\omega$ and $i\in3$.   Let $G$ be the group of those permutations of $U$ that leave the first component (in the Cantor set) of each atom unchanged.  So $G$ is the direct product of continuum-many copies of the symmetric group $S_3$.  To define the class of supports, let me first introduce the terminology ""thread"" for an $\omega$-sequence of atoms $[x_n,i_n]$ such that, for each $n$, $x_{n+1}$ is obtained from $x_n$ by deleting the first bit, i.e., $x_{n+1}(k)=x_n(k+1)$.  Let the supports be those subsets of $U$ that are covered by finitely many threads.  This choice of supports (along with the choice of $U$ and $G$) determines a permutation model $M$.

In $M$, let $A$ be the set of all the threads.  There is a surjection from $A$ to $A\times 2$, namely the map that sends any thread $T$ to the pair $(T',b)$ where $T'$ is obtained from $T$ by deleting its first term, say $[x_0,i_0]$, and $b=x_0(0)$.  (So $b$ is the one component in the real $x_0$ that is omitted when one forms $x_1$.)  This surjection is exactly 3 to 1, as it essentially just ""forgets"" the $i_0$ from $T$.  

I believe, but have not proved, that $M$ contains no injection from $A\times2$ into $A$.  The idea of the proof would be to assume there is such an injection, fix a finite number of threads that support it, and then look at what the injection could do with threads $T$ whose $x_0$ has no tail in common with anything from the support.

I further believe that the model would also work if I had used 2 instead of 3, but that the missing part of the proof will be easier with 3.  The point is that, with 2, each thread would support the ""complementary"" thread, consisting of the same reals $x_n$ but the other elements $i_n$ in 2. It would also support various ""mixtures"" of itself and the complementary thread.   With 3, a thread should support no threads other than itself and truncations of itself.

Going even further out on a limb, I also believe that the model would work if, instead of the whole Cantor space $2^\omega$, I used only the subspace consisting of the eventually periodic sequences of 0's and 1's and required threads also to be eventually periodic.  In this model, $A$ should be Dedekind-finite, thus answering the last part of your question.

2965,2965,4719,Does a terminator have a form of self-preservation or prohibition against suicide?,"This weekend I was watching Terminator 2 (editor cut). In the end, after T-1000 is destroyed, Arnold asks Sarah and John to destroy him by melting and says ""I cannot destroy myself"".

So, what does this mean? The terminator cannot destroy himself unless it is absolutely necessary in order to succeed in his mission (like protect John?)?

In that case, what was the Terminator in part 1 going to do after the success of his mission (i.e. destroy Sarah)? Just live a long happy life and wait for Skynet arise?

749,749,1185,"On surjections, idempotence and axiom of choice","The following assertion is trivial in ZFC, or even in much weaker theories. Is it also true in ZF?

(I couldn't find it in the Consequences site so far.)


  If $A$ is an infinite set such that $A$ can be mapped onto $A\times 2$ then $|A\times 2|=|A|$


The problem is that we cannot necessarily choose from every fiber of $f$, so we cannot construct an injection from $A$ to $f^{-1}(A\times\lbrace 0\rbrace)$, which will prove the assertion.

While I'm on the topic, is it possible for a D-finite set to have such property? It is possible for a D-finite set to be surjected onto a larger set than itself, but what about that large?
",Asaf Karagila,https://mathoverflow.net/users/7206,"The answer is no. 

First, I argue that it is consistent with ZF that a Dedekind
finite set $A$ can map onto $A\times 2$, and much more.

To see this, begin with any infinite Dedekind finite set $B\subset 2^\omega$, which is furthermore dense in the sense that any finite binary sequence has extensions in $B$. It is consistent with ZF that such a dense set $B$ exists, since in fact the usual symmetric-model arguments produce infinite Dedekind-finite sets that are dense.

Let $A$ consist of the finite non-repeating sequences from
$B$. Note that $A$ is still Dedekind finite, since any countably
infinite subset of $A$ can be used to produce a countably infinite
subset of $B$. Moreover, I claim that $A$ surjects onto
$A\times 2$ and indeed, onto $A^{{\lt}\omega}$. 

To see that $A$ surjects onto $A\times 2$, given $a=\langle b_0,\ldots,b_n\rangle\in A$, let $j$ be the first bit of $b_0$ and define $f(a)=(\langle b_1,\ldots,b_n\rangle,j)$. This is onto, since given any $(\langle b_1,\ldots,b_n\rangle,j)$, we just adjoin $b_0$ starting with digit $j$ to form $a=\langle b_0,\ldots b_n\rangle$, which maps to the original pair. 

For fun, let me show somewhat more, namely, that $A$ actually surjects onto $A^{{\lt}\omega}$. I shall define a function $f:A\to A^{{\lt}\omega}$ as follows. Suppose that we are given $a=\langle
b_0,\ldots,b_n\rangle\in A$. In order to define $f(a)$, we look at a certain finite initial segment of $b_0$, which we take to code a number $k$ and maps $\pi_i:n_i\to n$ for $i\lt k$. This can be coded in some canonical way, whose details are not important. (For example, perhaps $b_0$ starts with $k$ many $0$s, and after this there are $k$ blocks of $1$s, with the $i^{th}$ block of length $n_i$, and after this the bits are given to define the maps $\pi_i:n_i\to n$.) We use these maps to assemble $f(a)$ from the rest of the reals $b_1,\ldots,b_n$. Specifically, let $f(a)=\langle
\vec x_0,\ldots,\vec x_k\rangle\in A$, where $\vec x_i=\langle
b_{\pi_i(0)},\ldots,b_{\pi_i(n_i-1)}\rangle$. That is, each $\vec x_i$ enumerates a subset of $b_1,\ldots b_n$ in the order specified by $\pi_i$. In summary, a finite part of $b_0$ tells us how to assemble $f(a)$ according to a definite procedure from the other reals $b_1,\ldots,b_n$ appearing in $a$. (And if $b_0$ happens not to code things correctly, then we default to some constant value.) This defines $f:A\to A^{{\lt}\omega}$ without using the axiom of choice.
Furthermore, the map is surjective, since for any finite sequence
of injective tuples $\langle \vec x_0,\dots,\vec x_k\rangle$ from $B$, we may consider the reals appearing in those tuples and enumerate them $b_1,\ldots,b_n$, deleting repetitions, and then assemble a suitable $b_0$, using the fact that $B$ is dense in order to know that our desired collection of maps $\pi_i$ for $i\lt k$, which is coded by some finite binary sequence, can be extended to an element $b_0\in B$. It follows that $f(b_0,b_1,\ldots,b_n)$ is exactly the desired sequence of tuples. This surjectivity argument does not use the axiom of choice.

Is it also true in ZF?

(I couldn't find it in the Consequences site so far.)


  If $A$ is an infinite set such that $A$ can be mapped onto $A\times 2$ then $|A\times 2|=|A|$


The problem is that we cannot necessarily choose from every fiber of $f$, so we cannot construct an injection from $A$ to $f^{-1}(A\times\lbrace 0\rbrace)$, which will prove the assertion.

While I'm on the topic, is it possible for a D-finite set to have such property? It is possible for a D-finite set to be surjected onto a larger set than itself, but what about that large?
","The answer is no. 

First, I argue that it is consistent with ZF that a Dedekind
finite set $A$ can map onto $A\times 2$, and much more.

To see this, begin with any infinite Dedekind finite set $B\subset 2^\omega$, which is furthermore dense in the sense that any finite binary sequence has extensions in $B$. It is consistent with ZF that such a dense set $B$ exists, since in fact the usual symmetric-model arguments produce infinite Dedekind-finite sets that are dense.

Let $A$ consist of the finite non-repeating sequences from
$B$. Note that $A$ is still Dedekind finite, since any countably
infinite subset of $A$ can be used to produce a countably infinite
subset of $B$. Moreover, I claim that $A$ surjects onto
$A\times 2$ and indeed, onto $A^{{\lt}\omega}$. 

To see that $A$ surjects onto $A\times 2$, given $a=\langle b_0,\ldots,b_n\rangle\in A$, let $j$ be the first bit of $b_0$ and define $f(a)=(\langle b_1,\ldots,b_n\rangle,j)$. This is onto, since given any $(\langle b_1,\ldots,b_n\rangle,j)$, we just adjoin $b_0$ starting with digit $j$ to form $a=\langle b_0,\ldots b_n\rangle$, which maps to the original pair. 

For fun, let me show somewhat more, namely, that $A$ actually surjects onto $A^{{\lt}\omega}$. I shall define a function $f:A\to A^{{\lt}\omega}$ as follows. Suppose that we are given $a=\langle
b_0,\ldots,b_n\rangle\in A$. In order to define $f(a)$, we look at a certain finite initial segment of $b_0$, which we take to code a number $k$ and maps $\pi_i:n_i\to n$ for $i\lt k$. This can be coded in some canonical way, whose details are not important. (For example, perhaps $b_0$ starts with $k$ many $0$s, and after this there are $k$ blocks of $1$s, with the $i^{th}$ block of length $n_i$, and after this the bits are given to define the maps $\pi_i:n_i\to n$.) We use these maps to assemble $f(a)$ from the rest of the reals $b_1,\ldots,b_n$. Specifically, let $f(a)=\langle
\vec x_0,\ldots,\vec x_k\rangle\in A$, where $\vec x_i=\langle
b_{\pi_i(0)},\ldots,b_{\pi_i(n_i-1)}\rangle$. That is, each $\vec x_i$ enumerates a subset of $b_1,\ldots b_n$ in the order specified by $\pi_i$. In summary, a finite part of $b_0$ tells us how to assemble $f(a)$ according to a definite procedure from the other reals $b_1,\ldots,b_n$ appearing in $a$. (And if $b_0$ happens not to code things correctly, then we default to some constant value.) This defines $f:A\to A^{{\lt}\omega}$ without using the axiom of choice.
Furthermore, the map is surjective, since for any finite sequence
of injective tuples $\langle \vec x_0,\dots,\vec x_k\rangle$ from $B$, we may consider the reals appearing in those tuples and enumerate them $b_1,\ldots,b_n$, deleting repetitions, and then assemble a suitable $b_0$, using the fact that $B$ is dense in order to know that our desired collection of maps $\pi_i$ for $i\lt k$, which is coded by some finite binary sequence, can be extended to an element $b_0\in B$. It follows that $f(b_0,b_1,\ldots,b_n)$ is exactly the desired sequence of tuples. This surjectivity argument does not use the axiom of choice. 

In summary, $A$ surjects onto $A\times 2$ and even $A^{{\lt}\omega}$, but it is not bijective with $A\times 2$ or indeed with any superset of $A$, since it is Dedekind finite.

Thus, one cannot deduce in ZF that $A$ is bijective with $A\times 2$, just from knowing that it surjects onto $A\times 2$. This is true even when $A$ is a set of reals, since the example provided above has a bijection to a set of reals.

Another solution, that it closer is spirit to what you tried, is to modify \bibitem. If you look at the definition of \bibitem (using, for example, \show), you will see that it calls \@bibtem and this is where the \item command comes from. Hence, you can get what you want with the following:

\makeatletter
\def\@bibitem#1{\item[]%
    \if@filesw\immediate\write\@auxout{\string \bibcite {#1}{\the\value{\@listctr }}}\fi\ignorespaces}
\makeatletter


The difference between these two approaches is the indentation of the bibliography entries. The first attempt produces



whereas the second gives you



The first approach is the more robust and the second may have unintended side-effects, not least because it doesn't cater for the optional argument that \bibitem accepts.

You might want to fine-tune it a bit, e.g. if you want to have curved edges in the BDD. I had to manually shift the final 1 node in order for the edge from b being truly vertical.

Analysing this problem in parts may help answer each of the two facets, one at a time.

One - the interplay of Workflows and Triggers to implement Business Logic. It is up for debate how logic should be distributed, if not all of it can be accomplished in a trigger. Should workflows be used to implement as much is feasible, and only the absolute can't do's must live in a trigger. In my opinion yes, unless the resulting complexity is insanely great.

If you need to straddle logic across workflows and triggers, the 'heap' is the database, and control fields end up becoming the 'static' heap variables.

This is the only situation in which, in my opinion, control fields may be advocated.

The other facet is the use cases for use of control fields - If the resulting complexity of a distributed operation is too great, or if all of it can only be implemented in a trigger, than static 'heap' variables make the most sense, I can't see the needs for any entity specific control variables, although there may be a limited case for User level control fields, particularly in cases, where doing so may prove more efficient to streamline data integration / migration processes.

4862,4862,7735,struts2+spring3: passing a variable from action to jsp (javascript code),"First of all, thank you very much to all these that are trying to solve our problems in this forum;)

I am developing a web application with struts2+spring3. And I have a question about how to pass a variable (an array of arrays) from the action class to the jsp page.

I know that the only you need to do is to declare a private variable in my action and a get method for that variable and then its possible to access these variable from the jsp, I have done it and it works.

public class Workspace extends ActionSupport {

private String[][] objects=null;

public String[][] getObjects() {
    return objects;
}

public String execute() throws Exception{


The problem is that I want to access to this variable from the javascript code before loading the whole web page.

I have tried by different ways but it is never working.

$(function() {
var objectsMap=new Array();

    $(document).ready(function() {
          objectsMap = $objects;
    });


neither works (the alert says: ""Value: undefined""):

    &lt;s:set name=""auxObj"" value=""%{objects}""/&gt;
    &lt;script&gt;
        alert(""Value: ""+$(""#auxObj"").val());
    &lt;/script&gt;


Anyone have idea about how could I do that?

I am developing a web application with struts2+spring3. And I have a question about how to pass a variable (an array of arrays) from the action class to the jsp page.

I know that the only you need to do is to declare a private variable in my action and a get method for that variable and then its possible to access these variable from the jsp, I have done it and it works.

public class Workspace extends ActionSupport {

private String[][] objects=null;

public String[][] getObjects() {
    return objects;
}

public String execute() throws Exception{


The problem is that I want to access to this variable from the javascript code before loading the whole web page.

I have tried by different ways but it is never working.

$(function() {
var objectsMap=new Array();

    $(document).ready(function() {
          objectsMap = $objects;
    });


neither works (the alert says: ""Value: undefined""):

    &lt;s:set name=""auxObj"" value=""%{objects}""/&gt;
    &lt;script&gt;
        alert(""Value: ""+$(""#auxObj"").val());
    &lt;/script&gt;


Anyone have idea about how could I do that?

",Schism,https://gaming.stackexchange.com/users/31508,"I'm not the best support player, but maybe I can give you another point of view.

Zyra doesn't have any ability to heal her lane partner, nor does she have an escape mechanism. Additionally, her harass is based on her skills.

To counter her, I would recommend Soraka, for 2 reasons:


Sustain

Since you have the aability to heal your carry and Zyra doesn't, you can stay longer in the lane   and harass the opponent. Ask your carry to harass as much as possible, and you will force them to go back to base, giving your partner a gold advantage.
Silence

Zyra is based on her skills; as Soraka, you have the ability to silence her every time she gets close to you or your partner.


If Zyra is still bothering you, simply put a ward in her brush. This allows you to predict her moves and gives vision of her to your carry, so he can harass her.

If I could choose a lane partner, I would pick Caitlyn, as her long range makes her pretty good at harassing the opponents.

As a support, your role is to keep your carry safe. If Zyra tries to harass you, silence her and attack back, healing right after. Soon, they will have low hp and your hp will stay full.

I've been able to do it: 

Split[AA, First[#1] === First[#2] &amp;]


But I do not understand the theory behind it. This is how far I got


  Split[list, test] treats pairs of adjacent elements as identical 
  whenever applying the function test to them yields True. 


From this I get that Split is a function where AA is my list, and that it splits the data into groups when the test yields true. 

But I get confused here. 

First[#1] === First[#2] &amp;

First[{a, b, c}] 



  a


Based on this I get that it picks the first element of the list within the list, in my case ""KO"" This means that when First[#1] equals First[#2], it yields true. However, I don't understand the function of #.

How does this predicate function work? Does it take

Row 1 column 1 = Row 2 column 1 --&gt; False
Row 2 column 1 = Row 3 column 1 --&gt; True 
Row 3 Column 1 = Row 4 column 1 --&gt; True 
...


and then group all the True and all the False together and create seperate lists? 

Same function again: 

I'm just not sure what #1 does in the list and what #2 does in the list and why &amp; needs to be added at the end. 

Same function as above ---> Split[AA, First[#1] === First[#2] &amp;]
",ALEXANDER,https://mathematica.stackexchange.com/users/8148,"You seem to be on the right track but having some trouble with the anonomous function syntax. I highly recommend you read up on this as it's a very useful concept. Essentially #1+#2&amp; is shorthand that translates into Function[{arg1,arg2},arg1+arg2]. So a good place to start is the documentation for Function. 

Now to the problem at hand. I understand it you want to sort your list such that you get one list containing all entries starting with ""KO"", and one with all the entries starting with ""MCD"", and so forth. In that case you should not be using Split on it's own. Since it only sorts out runs of identical elements. eg Split[{a,a,b,a,a}]=&gt; {{a,a},{b},{a,a}} So what you need to do is to first sort your list, and then split it. Now it happens to be the case that there are convinient functions for sorting and splitting based on the output of a function, so you don't actually need the First[#1]==First[#2]&amp; syntaxt that you find confusing. Still I would again highly recommend you read up on it. Anyways, here's an example of code that solves your problem:

 sortedAA = SortBy[AA, First];
 splitAA  = SplitBy[sortedAA, First];


First we sort the list so that all entries with the same first element apear in order eg. SortBy[{a,a,b,a,a},First] =&gt; {a,a,a,a,b}, then we split this into sublists, eg. Split[{a,a,a,a,b}] =&gt; {{a,a,a,a},{b}}.

As you progress in your study of higher mathematics (beyond freshman calculus), you will find that mathematics instills a discipline for abstract reasoning that will serve you well when you program.  I think that this discipline is very important because you will deal with abstract concerns as you program.

Sure, in freshman programming, you will likely learn about pointer arithmetic.  You will write short programs to illustrate this concept and your understanding of how it drives your computer obey your will.  However, learning about how pointer arithmetic works in the abstract will not make you good at using pointers in a real program.  When it comes time to take on a mess of 10K lines of code and make some changes to the pointer arithmetic, you will need to be able to reason at a very abstract level, making strategic decisions to balance different concerns about how your changes will affect the code.

As a programmer, you must balance ""readability"" of your code, performance of your code, ease-of-use of the resulting programs, among many other concerns.  You must be able to make very abstract comparisons to balance these concerns among one another.  You will make many of these comparisons every day.  I haven't even gotten started about time-management.  You will abstractly reason about the probability that something you do will affect your ability to do your tasks on time, and once again, you will make many decisions every day that will affect your work.

Finally, you must maintain your philosophical discipline to be able to assimilate new ideas and concepts in order to be able to continue on as old methodologies and practices fall out of use.  Once again, you will have to be able to evaluate the ideas that come along and make an abstract comparison to what you already know.

What you are describing is very clearly a ""Visa Run"", and even if it's technically within the rules of what is allowed under the VWP (and whether it is or not will depend on the exact details, many of which you haven't provided), there is a very real chance that you will NOT be allowed re-enter the US on your second attempt if the immigration official decides that you are doing a Visa Run.

Instead you should likely apply for a US B-2 visa which will allow you to stay in the US for up to 6 months at a time.

648,648,1029,local AJAX-call to remote site works in Safari but not in other browsers,"I am maintaining a website that uses Javascript. The script uses jQuery and loads some content from the server at which the site is normally hosted.

Just for convenience while maintaining the site, I run a local copy of the site on my iMac. This works perfectly fine when I use Safari. But Firefox, Opera and Chrome refuse to work. I guess it is because of cross-domain-policy. (I couldn't test this with IE, because IE has to run in a virtual machine on my iMac, so for this reason it is not possible to access any local files)

Is there a setting within Firefox and the other browsers where I can tell the browser that it is ok to ajax-load files that are located on a remote server from a local html-page with a local javascript?

In a nutshell: This my html-page:

&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;meta charset=""UTF-8""&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;some title&lt;/title&gt;
        &lt;link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""../css/stylesheet.css""&gt;
        &lt;script src=""../js/jquery-2.1.3.min.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
        &lt;script src=""../js/myScript.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;!-- some content with a div-container to receive the ajax-content --&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;


This is myScript.js:

var errorMsg = function (msg) {
    //insert the message into the html-page
};

var JSONerror = function (jqXHR, textStatus, errorThrown ) {
    var msg = 'JSON-answer: '+jqXHR.responseText;
    msg += '&lt;br&gt;'+'JSON-Errorstatus: '+textStatus;
    if ($.type(errorThrown) === 'string') {
        msg += '&lt;br&gt;'+'Error: '+errorThrown;
    }
    errorMsg(msg);
};

var JSONreceive = function (JSONobj, StatusString, jqXHR) {
    //insert the data in JSONobj into the html-page
}

var StartAJAX = function () {
    $.ajax({
        url: 'http://my.domain.tld/cgi-bin/myPerlScript.pl',
        data: ""lastID="" + lastID
           + '&amp;qkz=' + Math.random(),
           dataType: ""json"",
           success: JSONreceive,
           error: JSONerror
    });
};


There is also an event-listener, that listens for page-scroll and resize and checks some other constraints (like: is there already an ajax-call in progress?). This listener calls StartAJAX.

When it calls StartAJAX on a local copy of my page (file:///User/...) within Safari, I get the Ajax-content perfectly fine inserted into my html-document. within the other browsers i get the error-message inserted into the html-page. It is:


  JSON-Answer: undefined
  JSON-Errorstatus: error
  Error:


Why does it work in Safari but not in Firefox, Chrome and Opera?  

How can I make those browsers work?

(I need to test it with all browsers, because all browsers render the same html-domument differently, but I don't want to upload all files to the server after every change just to test it.)

EDIT:

After reading some answers, I want to make something clear, that I obviously did not make clear enough:

I am searching for settings in Webbrowsers


I will NOT change the settings of my remote webserver (Apache)
I will NOT manipulate any files on my remote machine (.htaccess)
I will NOT set up a webserver on my local iMac
I will NOT change the code of the AJAX-calls in my Javascript-files
I will NOT change the code of the Perl-Scripts on my remote Server


I can tell you why:

I am just doing a short maintainance, and i am too lazy to upload every manipulated file to the remote machine after I edited it. The settings of the webserver are fine for actual operation. I don't want to change them (and maybe forget the changes before finishing my work). Same for the scripts: Those parts that some of you want to change work fine as they are now. There is no reason to touch the Ajax-Calls, because there is nothing wrong with them in the productive environment.

All I want is that those stupid browsers Firefox, Opera and Chrome behave like Safari and process the Ajax-calls correctly.

BTW:

Please can anyone explain what is so risky to call data via Ajax from an other domain in Firefox, Opera or Chrome while it seems to be harmless doing the same thing in Safari?

6016,6016,9549,CMOS 4066 Question,"This is my first post here and I have a question about a CMOS circuit I have been designing for I while using the 4066 (I'm a noob to digital electronics). I am using a 4066 to pass random pulses I generated by feeding a noise generator with two two outputs (the generator is connected to a JFET amp and then clamped with diodes to two different dc voltages) into a 4050 (one buffer for each noise gen output). The pulses work perfectly. The only problem is, when the 4066 is not enabled, about 1 volt of the pulses pass through each switch. I was wondering if there was any way to fix that! Here is my circuit:


",Zack Frost,https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/37971,"As noted, adding a resistor to the desired ""idle state"" voltage will cause the output to swing to that voltage when the 4066 is disabled.  If one would like the output to stay at its present voltage when the 4066 is disabled, and if one is driving a high-impedance load, one may instead use a capacitor.  If a capacitor is used, then while the 4066 is enabled the cap voltage will swing toward the input, and when it is disabled it will tend to stay more or less where it is (though it will likely drift away from its present voltage at some speed).  The larger the cap, the more slowly the cap will switch to the desired voltage, but the more slowly it will drift away.  Feeding the output of the 4066 into an op amp wired as a voltage follower may also slow down the drift.

I'm not sure exactly what you are intending your circuit for, but some kinds of ""random computer noise"" were historically generated by feeding a noise source through an analog switch which was turned on briefly about 5-10 times/second, and then a cap; the voltage on that cap was then used to control the frequency of an oscillator.

I have a question about a CMOS circuit, which I have been designing for me, while using 4066. I use 4066 to transmit random pulses, and I generate a feed noise generator with two outputs (the generator is connected to a JFET amplifier and then clamped with diodes to two different DC voltages) to 4050 (a buffer for each noise generator output). The pulse works normally. The only problem is that when 4066 is not enabled, about 1 volt pulses pass through each switch. I wonder if there is any way to solve this problem! This is my line:","As mentioned earlier, when 4066 is disabled, adding a resistance to the desired ""idle state"" voltage will cause the output to oscillate to that voltage. If you want the output to maintain its current voltage when 4066 is disabled, and if you drive a high impedance load, you can use a capacitor. If a capacitor is used, then when 4066 is enabled, the capacitor voltage will swing toward the input, and when it is disabled, it will tend to stay more or less in its original position (although it may deviate from the current voltage at some speed). The higher the upper limit, the slower the upper limit switches to the desired voltage, but the slower the drift. The drift can also be slowed down by using the output input of 4066 as the operational amplifier connected with the voltage follower."

",Rafael Dazcal,https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/11101,"In free space, it doesn't matter.  The power per incident area of a propagating wave is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the transmitter.  This is true regardless of frequency.

Certain frequencies are reflected, refracted, absorbed, and scattered differently by different materials.

Diffraction effects can make low fequencies (long wavelengths) appear to bend around objects, but this actually occurs at all wavelengths.  The ""near"" layer where diffraction effects occur scales with wavelength, so it appears to us at a fixed human scale that long wavelengths go ""around"" objects where short wavelengths don't, but that is due to our perception scale.  On the scale of the earth, commercial AM radio frequencies around 1 MHz are low enough to diffract around the curvature of the earth to some extent making over the horizon AM reception possible.

The ""near"" layer where diffraction effects occur scales with wavelength, so it appears to us at a fixed human scale that long wavelengths go ""around"" objects where short wavelengths don't, but that is due to our perception scale.  On the scale of the earth, commercial AM radio frequencies around 1 MHz are low enough to diffract around the curvature of the earth to some extent making over the horizon AM reception possible.  Commercial FM radio, being 100x shorter wavelength, exhibits this effect much less for the same size earth, so FM radio appears to us to be mostly occluded by the horizon.

3983,3983,6359,Complexity class of an idealised version of Bitcoin's proof-of-work (hashcash)?,"To formulate this question precisely, I will define an idealized hypothetical ""perfect"" hash function $H(n)$ which has nice scalability properties, and will formulate a problem PERFECT HASHCASH in terms of that, understanding that practical considerations may end up yielding only an approximation of this ideal.

To keep it simple, we will say that our hash function $H(n)$ takes as input a single natural number $n$. Then we say that $H(n)$ is a perfect hash function iff:


$H:\mathbb N \to \{0,1\}^\infty$; That is, $H$ maps each natural number to an infinite binary sequence, and which the time complexity to compute any initial segment $s$ is polynomial in the size of $n$ and $s$, (making it a sponge function).
For any initial segment of length $d$, the set of all natural numbers $n$ such that $H(n)$ shares that initial segment has natural density $2^{-d}$.


The first thing formalizes the scalability of our function, and the second thing formalizes the idea that we want all hashes to appear roughly ""equally often"" as an output. Other than that, our perfect hash function is a black box, and we don't care much about exactly how it works, so long as it meets the above properties, as well as the usual desiderata applying to hash functions (easy to compute, hard to invert, hard to find collisions, etc).

Predicated on the assumption that a perfect hash function exists, we can now define the problem PERFECT HASHCASH as follows: PERFECT HASHCASH takes as input a perfect hash function $H$, a natural number $n$, and the zero vector $0^d$ of length $d$, which can be thought of as a unary representation of $d$. A solution to PERFECT HASHCASH consists of an $n$ and $d$ such that $H(n)$ starts with $0^d$.

Given those inputs, it is clear that PERFECT HASHCASH is in the complexity class TFNP, since this is a function problem and a solution is guaranteed to exist.

Can we also identify PERFECT HASHCASH as a member of any complexity class finer than TFNP?

Could it perhaps be in PPP? PPA? PPAD? Something else?

  If we take 47, reverse and add, 47 + 74 = 121, which is palindromic.

",matheussilvapb,https://codereview.stackexchange.com/users/37913,"Hints


According to the example in the problem description, 349 is not a Lychrel number. As a hint for speeding things up, I'd like to point out that the example computation might also tell you something about, say, the number 1292.

What I'm trying to say is that when you evaluate 1292, you will be performing part of the same computation that you already did with 349. The same applies to the reversed forms of each number, but there's a catch: the reversal is not symmetric when trailing zeros are present. 210 reversed is 12, but 12 reversed is 21.
A single reverse-add operation typically maps multiple numbers to the same number. If you figure out how that works, you can reduce the number of cases you need to consider.


Changes suggested by hint 1


To be able to take timings with timeit, I first rearranged your top-level code to a function. I also changed the ranges to 50 and 10000, for reasons explained in Gareth's answer.

def e55():
    candidates = []
    for number in range(10000):
        if is_lychrel(number):
            candidates.append(number)
    return len(candidates)


This runs in 158 ms on my computer:

$ python3 -m timeit -s ""from e55_op import e55"" ""e55()"" 
10 loops, best of 3: 158 msec per loop    

The main function could be written more concisely. This one is marginally slower at 161 ms:

def e55():
    return sum(1 for number in range(10000) if is_lychrel(number))

Now to the performance optimization. I want to avoid following the same sequence of iteration more than once. First, I'll extract the loop from is_lychrel into a recursive function. This in itself does not make it run faster, but neither does it slow it down.

def check(number, depth):
    ''' Returns True if 'number' is neither a palindrome
    nor becomes one in 'depth' iterations of reverse-add.'''
    rev = reverse(number)
    return number != rev and (not depth or check(number + rev, depth-1))

def is_lychrel(number):
    ''' Returns True if 'number' is a lychrel candidate,
        but works only with numbers from 1 to 10000 '''
    return check(number + reverse(number), 49) 

The speedup comes from making the recursive function cache its return values in a dictionary. I'll also eliminate the is_lychrel function as it is called from only one place.


The complete code is below and runs in 36.5 ms. I also timed Gareth's proposal: 54.8 ms.

def reverse(number):
    ''' Returns the reverse order of an integer,
        for example: reverse(123) returns the integer 321 '''
    number = str(number)
    return int(number[::-1])

def check(number, depth, cache):
    ''' Returns True if 'number' is neither a palindrome
        nor becomes one in 'depth' iterations of reverse-add.'''
    if number not in cache:
        rev = reverse(number)
        cache[number] = (number != rev 
            and (not depth or check(number + rev, depth-1, cache)))
    return cache[number]

def e55():
    cache = {}
    return sum(1 for number in range(10000) 
               if check(number + reverse(number), 49, cache))


Notes:


I'm resetting the cache inside e55 because timeit runs the function multiple times. Each iteration has to be able to start from the same state.
Calling check with depth=49 causes 50 iterations to be evaluated, because it starts from an already reverse-added number.


Hint 2: math

Let's consider all 4-digit numbers. Labeling the digits abcd we can represent the number as 

a*1000 + b*100 + c*10 + d


Reverse-add results in

(a+d)*1000 + (b+c)*100 + (c+b)*10 + (d+a)
= (a+d)*1001 + (b+c)*110


As a ranges from 1 to 9 and the other digits from 0 to 9, (a+d) can take values from 1 to 18 and (b+c) from 0 to 18. Thus there are 18*19 = 342 possible values for the expression (a+d)*1001 + (b+c)*110. That gives an opportunity to speed up the program if we make it loop over the 342 sums instead of the 9000 4-digit numbers. There is the extra complication that we need to calculate how many numbers map to each reverse-add result, but that is not very complicated. 

The 3-, 2- and 1-digit cases can be analyzed in the same way.

Hint 2: implementation

I'm using collections.Counter to determine how many ways there are to add two numbers for each sum. I've inlined the reverse function because it is called from only one place.

This code runs in 4.64 ms, which is a 34X speedup from the original.

from collections import Counter

    ''' Returns True if 'number' is neither a palindrome
        nor becomes one in 'depth' iterations of reverse-add.'''

        cache[number] = (number != rev 
            and (not depth or check(number + rev, depth-1, cache)))
    return cache[number]

def cases():
    ''' Yields numbers that can result from reverse-adding numbers
        below 10000, and the frequency of each'''
    freqs00_99 = Counter(i % 10 + i // 10 for i in range(100))
    freqs10_99 = Counter(i % 10 + i // 10 for i in range(10,100))

    for i in range(10):
        yield 2*i, 1        # from one digit
    for i, f_outer in freqs10_99.items():
        yield 11*i, f_outer # from two digits

This runs in 158 ms on my computer:

I'm resetting the cache inside e55 because timeit runs the function multiple times. Each iteration has to be able to start from the same state.

Let's consider all 4-digit numbers. Labeling the digits abcd we can represent the number as 

a*1000 + b*100 + c*10 + d


Reverse-add results in

(a+d)*1000 + (b+c)*100 + (c+b)*10 + (d+a)
= (a+d)*1001 + (b+c)*110


As a ranges from 1 to 9 and the other digits from 0 to 9, (a+d) can take values from 1 to 18 and (b+c) from 0 to 18. Thus there are 18*19 = 342 possible values for the expression (a+d)*1001 + (b+c)*110. That gives an opportunity to speed up the program if we make it loop over the 342 sums instead of the 9000 4-digit numbers. There is the extra complication that we need to calculate how many numbers map to each reverse-add result, but that is not very complicated. 

The 3-, 2- and 1-digit cases can be analyzed in the same way.

2565,2565,4083,Export Resolution in Adobe Illustrator,"I've mainly used Photoshop before and only just picked up Illustrator a few days ago. Anyway, I used Illustrator to create lots of images (with transparent backgrounds) of different letters, each one filled with circles. More to the point, upon exporting as a .PNG, I noticed a resolution option. Me being the little derp that I am, I figured a larger resolution is always better, so I set this to high (300 ppi).

Upon importing the images into my project however, I realized that the images had become a lot larger than they should be. Upon tweaking the export resolution setting, I noticed that if I set this to low (72 ppi), the images come out as the expected size. I was just wondering how I should expect this to effect my drawings. If I were to keep the high resolution images I exported at 300 ppi, am I always going to be forced to reduce their size afterwards by a certain amount? Otherwise, should I always stick to  72 ppi in order to keep the size of the image the same and to avoid needing to re-size things later?

Image quality is not so important in this case, so there probably isn't much reason for me to use anything higher than 72 ppi anyway. Just for the sake of learning however, I thought this would be a good question to ask.

2352,2352,3749,Does a terminator have a form of self-preservation or prohibition against suicide?,"This weekend I was watching Terminator 2 (editor cut). In the end, after T-1000 is destroyed, Arnold asks Sarah and John to destroy him by melting and says ""I cannot destroy myself"".

So, what does this mean? The terminator cannot destroy himself unless it is absolutely necessary in order to succeed in his mission (like protect John?)?

In that case, what was the Terminator in part 1 going to do after the success of his mission (i.e. destroy Sarah)? Just live a long happy life and wait for Skynet arise?

Update:
I understand that this is not the exact Third law of Asimov, since the terminators definitely don't follow the First or Second law. Let's call it the law of self-preservation. Does terminator have a form of self-preservation to some point and the prohibition of suicide?
",SPIRiT_1984,https://scifi.stackexchange.com/users/4435,"In the book version, the Terminator does indeed terminate itself.

However, regarding the movie: It says (1:30) ""I cannot self-terminate"" (emphasis by me). This is different from ""I mustn't self-terminate"" or ""I may not self-terminate"", which could be read as: It's not forbidden for it to terminate itself, but it simply does not have the ability to do it.

This is a bit argumentative, because from the fact that it knows how to terminate a T-1000 you may assume that it could terminate a hostile T-800 as well, and it seems intelligent enough to realise that it is a T-800 as well meaning that the same means would have to be taken to terminate itself than a different T-800.

Being rich doesn't mean you are happy.
Being a successful person in life is a big challenge.
Being a doctor doesn't mean you are smart.


The sense of ""being"" at the start of a sentence depends on its context.

In all the sentences being has been used as a gerund. Being rich, being a doctor, and being a successful person are gerund clauses that are subjects of the sentences.

These sentences imply as follows:


If/when you are  rich, it doesn't mean you are happy.
If/when you are a doctor, it doesn't mean you are smart.
It is a big challenge to be a successful person in life.


You can also use to-infinitive instead of being, but the use of the to-infinitive isn't so common.

Besides, in the construct of some sentences, being is also used to express a reason or cause as an alternative to because, since, or as.  For example:

Being the youngest, Sara is her father's favourite.

$$z\cos\left(z^{-1}\right) \equiv z - \frac{z^{-1}}{2!} + \frac{z^{-3}}{4!} - \frac{z^{-5}}{6!} \pm \cdots $$

The coefficient of $z^{-1}$ is $-\frac{1}{2!} = -\frac{1}{2}$.

You are arrested, prosecuted locally and serve your sentence where you committed your crime. As others have said, local law fully applies, it happens all the time. Your home country should be informed and can at most complain and try to exert some pressure on a political level but you don't have any extraordinary legal protection only because you are a foreign national. For a famous recent case illustrating this, see Amanda Knox.
You are arrested, prosecuted and sentenced but you are allowed to serve your sentence in your home country. As @MastaBaba pointed out, there are international agreements to organise this on a bilateral basis.
You are arrested, prosecuted, sentenced and you serve your sentence but it doesn't end there. You can still be deported and/or banned after the end of your sentence. Many European countries have actually introduced or strengthened legislation to this end in the last decade. So it's not either face trial or be deported, if you are really “lucky” it could be both!
You are arrested and criminal proceedings are initiated but you manage to come back home at some point during the procedure. In Europe, for a simple theft with no prior offence or aggravating circumstances, a jail sentence is unlikely and it is therefore unusual to be detained prior to trial. If you choose to “jump bail” and somehow manage to leave the country, things become a bit complicated. Among the possibilities:


The country where you committed your crime seeks your extradition to force you to appear in court and/or execute your sentence (not always possible because some countries never extradite their own citizens). For another prominent example, see Roman Polanski.
You are sentenced in absentia. Institutions like the Council of Europe have been pushing against this practice but some countries still do it. You might or might not be entitled to a retrial when you are finally caught but one effect is typically to suspend or extend statutes of limitation so that such a sentence means you will have to look over your shoulder and avoid going back to the country of your crime (or possibly all the countries that have an extradition treaty with that country) for the rest of your life.
You could still face prosecution in your home country (see below), although that would seem exceedingly unlikely for a theft.

Nothing happens, you come back home and are prosecuted in your country of origin. Many countries do that for particularly serious crimes but some countries also allow it for pretty much everything, in particular because they never extradite their own citizens. In the latter case, the crime in question must typically exist in the laws of both countries whereas in the former case, it's sometimes even possible to prosecute people for things that were not illegal where and when they happened (e.g. in many European countries, laws against child prostitution typically apply to offences committed abroad, without any reference to local law).
You are prosecuted in another, unrelated third country. It's unusual and typically limited to particularly heinous crimes (and in particular war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide) but it does happen. Among those that might take interest are your country or countries of residence or the country of origin or residence of any of your victims and Baltasar Garzón. See also Wikipedia.


Among other curiosities, the fact that it might sometimes be possible to be prosecuted in several places also raises questions related to the application of the non bis in idem principle.

In short, it depends a lot on the details, there is no overarching principle or international agreement that would apply in all cases.

2401,2401,3832,How do native speakers 'guess' the pronunciation of the letters in a word they see for the first time?,"I confess! Being a non-native speaker, I struggle a lot especially when I come across a new word. And I wonder how do native speakers pronounce perfectly even though they read the word for the very first time. There should be some rule/technique? I'm not sure.

Let's take a case. 

If I see a word having 'ch' for the very first time, how do I guess it? Remember, I don't have dictionary. Nor do I have access to this great site when I encounter that word. For example, 

Take the word 'chariot'. Being a non-native with quite limited knowledge of orthography, I know that 'ch' is pronounced as in 'Charles'

But then, imagine, I came across the word 'charade'. Undoubtedly, for me, it is 'ch (as in Charles)-re-d-s'. But then, actually, 'ch' there is 'sh' (as in Shane). 

It's not just 'ch' but it goes for 'g' as well. 'G' as in 'goat' or 'g' as in 'gymnastic'. Is there any source that teaches how to pronounce a letter if it is placed after/before certain letter? Is there any such rule? The one I remember is when a word ends with 'mb', you don't pronounce 'b'. 'Bomb', 'Comb', 'Tomb' and many other words ending with 'b'.  



There are a few more words that add another nail in the coffin of my pronunciation complexity! 


  penis (pee, and not as in 'pen')  asthma (no 'th' pronounced)  Dengue (dengeee)  and many more...

",Maulik V,https://ell.stackexchange.com/users/3187,"Since pronunciation changes over time, any system of spelling that was mapped to pronunciation at a point-in-time would eventually get out-of-sync with the way people are speaking.  

The system of spelling also has to make a choice (explicitly or implicitly): 

a) nominate a ""standard"" pronunciation, so that from the get-go the system would not map to regional variations in pronunciation; or 

b) reflect regional pronunciation, so there would be many ways to spell the same word. 

The latter was the case before English spelling was standardized. There are dozens of ways to spell the word for 'sister' in Old English, for example.

The Googles of the world would have a difficult time searching if a word might be spelled in a given text in any number of ways. All searches would have to be phonetic, and the search engine would have to understand the rules of regional pronunciation, and to the degree it did not, there would be misses and false positives galore.

It's possible to ""get close"" when guessing a pronunciation, but that's about it.
If you don't recognize the word as a loan-word from another language, say, and so may be following some special rule, you won't stand much chance of guessing right. For example: depot. But for the most part, spelling of English  words does follow some basic phonetic rules that can be learned.

But then, imagine, I came across the word 'charade'. Undoubtedly, for me, it is 'ch (as in Charles)-re-d-s'. But then, actually, 'ch' there is 'sh' (as in Shane). 

It's not just 'ch' but it goes for 'g' as well. 'G' as in 'goat' or 'g' as in 'gymnastic'. Is there any source that teaches how to pronounce a letter if it is placed after/before certain letter? Is there any such rule? The one I remember is when a word ends with 'mb', you don't pronounce 'b'. 'Bomb', 'Comb', 'Tomb' and many other words ending with 'b'.  



There are a few more words that add another nail in the coffin of my pronunciation complexity! 


  penis (pee, and not as in 'pen')  asthma (no 'th' pronounced)  Dengue (dengeee)  and many more...

","Since pronunciation changes over time, any system of spelling that was mapped to pronunciation at a point-in-time would eventually get out-of-sync with the way people are speaking.  

The system of spelling also has to make a choice (explicitly or implicitly): 

a) nominate a ""standard"" pronunciation, so that from the get-go the system would not map to regional variations in pronunciation; or 

b) reflect regional pronunciation, so there would be many ways to spell the same word. 

The latter was the case before English spelling was standardized. There are dozens of ways to spell the word for 'sister' in Old English, for example.

The Googles of the world would have a difficult time searching if a word might be spelled in a given text in any number of ways. All searches would have to be phonetic, and the search engine would have to understand the rules of regional pronunciation, and to the degree it did not, there would be misses and false positives galore.

It's possible to ""get close"" when guessing a pronunciation, but that's about it.
If you don't recognize the word as a loan-word from another language, say, and so may be following some special rule, you won't stand much chance of guessing right. For example: depot. But for the most part, spelling of English  words does follow some basic phonetic rules that can be learned.

How to move the s arrow down without increasing the radius for the circle? I mean, I'd like to have a bigger space between the arrow and B. I know that I could add a new line but I'd like to keep only one.
Why \displaystyle is lifting A? How to write correctly the middle fraction? I tried \dfrac but no success.

",Sigur,https://tex.stackexchange.com/users/14757,"
The arrow head gets broken when touching the target. You have to shift the whole arrow down until it fits again. If you replace the fraction by just A, it works.
You have just the possibility to shift the arrow like in \ar@&lt;-1ex&gt; or to increase the radius. I would not do both but just increase the vertical height of the first cell.
I loaded amsmath and \dfrac works as expected. \xymatrix gets set in inline math style. No matter if you put it in $$ or in \[\] ([preview] option to standalone needed)


Here is my approach. I just found out that the depth of the first cell has to be a little bit bigger than the depth of the last cell. The bigger the subscript, the bigger the distance between s and \dfrac{A}{B}

(original post)


I have no idea how to correct the arrow tip for s arrow. The strange is that I just copied the code for s from another diagram I have in the same file, which works perfectly, as you can see below:





How to move the s arrow down without increasing the radius for the circle? I mean, I'd like to have a bigger space between the arrow and B. I know that I could add a new line but I'd like to keep only one.
Why \displaystyle is lifting A? How to write correctly the middle fraction? I tried \dfrac but no success.

","
The arrow head gets broken when touching the target. You have to shift the whole arrow down until it fits again. If you replace the fraction by just A, it works.
You have just the possibility to shift the arrow like in \ar@&lt;-1ex&gt; or to increase the radius. I would not do both but just increase the vertical height of the first cell.
I loaded amsmath and \dfrac works as expected. \xymatrix gets set in inline math style. No matter if you put it in $$ or in \[\] ([preview] option to standalone needed)


Here is my approach. I just found out that the depth of the first cell has to be a little bit bigger than the depth of the last cell. The bigger the subscript, the bigger the distance between s and \dfrac{A}{B}

On these line segments there are points in the same order: $X,Y,Z,V$. We know, that: $$\frac{AX}{XB}=\frac{BY}{YC}=\frac{CZ}{ZD}=\frac{DV}{VA}=k$$

$k$ is a positive constant what is less then $\frac{1}{2}$. What is the value of $k$, if the area of $XYZV$ is 86% of the area of $ABCD$?

Can you tell me a step by step answer to this question?
",encuka,https://math.stackexchange.com/users/212147,"Let $AB = CD = a$ and $BC = AD = b$. Then we have:

$$\frac{AX}{XB} = k \implies \frac{a}{XB} = k+1 \implies XB = \frac{a}{k+1}$$

",Baskaran,https://photo.stackexchange.com/users/26934,"I don't know what specific model rotary wheel Nikon used in that camera, but moving it fast shouldn't cause any excessive wear.

These rotary wheels are usually just rather simple mechanical switches.  There are usually two separate switches.  Each goes thru one complete cycle each detent, but the two are off from each other by 1/4 cycle.  The fancy name for that is quadrature.  With two quadrature signals, there are 4 states that get sequenced thru for each whole increment.  It is quite easy to decode these two signals to keep track of the position of the wheel, regardless of what direction it is being moved in.

One part of the switch usually rubs against a part of the wheel so that it is moved into and out of contact with the other part of the switch.

","I don't know what specific model rotary wheel Nikon used in that camera, but moving it fast shouldn't cause any excessive wear.

These rotary wheels are usually just rather simple mechanical switches.  There are usually two separate switches.  Each goes thru one complete cycle each detent, but the two are off from each other by 1/4 cycle.  The fancy name for that is quadrature.  With two quadrature signals, there are 4 states that get sequenced thru for each whole increment.  It is quite easy to decode these two signals to keep track of the position of the wheel, regardless of what direction it is being moved in.

One part of the switch usually rubs against a part of the wheel so that it is moved into and out of contact with the other part of the switch.  The wear on the device is therefore mostly related to total revolutions, not how fast those revolutions are, at least not for something you can do by hand.

So I would like to understand the case for believing the Genesis creation account, among all Biblical texts, is one that is intended to be interpreted literally. I'm not interested in scientific evidence for a young-earth in these answers. I'm interested in Biblical or historical reasons why this text, as a whole (as opposed to individual words), should be considered literal.

I would also discourage answers that address specific words in the Genesis account (such as the Hebrew 'yom'), but if that is the strongest evidence you have, then I won't consider it an invalid answer.
",Flimzy,https://christianity.stackexchange.com/users/20,"No textual reason for interpreting Genesis figuratively

Whenever we ask why we should take something in the Bible as literal, we must start by asking ask why we should not take it as literal.  Does the text give us any reason to interpret it as being figurative?  In the book of Revelation, and other places where mortal man is given a glimpse of eternity, descriptions employ the use of comparison quite frequently.  It was like this or had the appearance of that.  The Genesis account employs no such language.  

(By the way, the assumption that the Song of Solomon is figuratively is certainly debatable.)

The Order of Genesis

In fact, the Genesis account is written as if it were an actual account with a very logical order.  There are six distinct units in which creative works take place.  Each of these units is described as a day, with an evening and a morning.  (The Jewish and Muslim traditions still follow this pattern by marking sundown as the beginning of the next day.)

Genesis 1:2 identifies the nature of the earth:


  The earth was without form and void, and darkness was over the
  face of the deep. And the Spirit of God was hovering over the face of
  the waters.  Genesis 1:2 ESV


I have heard this original state of ""without form and void"" paraphrased as unformed and unfilled.  The first three days of Genesis are dedicated to forming while the second three days are dedicated to filling.  What is formed on the first day is filled on the 4th days, whatever is formed on the 2nd day is filled on the 5th, and so forth.  So, there are specific divisions that represent a very orderly process, which aligns better with an actual record rather than a figurative story.

Confirmation of Scripture

As Warren noted, other places in Scripture affirm the six days of creation.


  Six days you shall labor and do all your work, but the seventh day is
  a sabbath of the LORD your God .. For in six days the LORD made the
  heavens and the earth, the sea and all that is in them, and rested on
  the seventh day.  Exodus 20:8-11 NASB


Problems with figurative interpretations

Finally, the figurative interpretation breaks down.  If a days is a billion years, then how did flowers get pollinated when there were no bees in existence for another billion years?  Also, if the sixth day is a billion years from Adam, then we have not yet reached the 7th day of God's rest, since we have a genealogy from Adam that is roughly 6,000 years.  Fictitious characters do not have genealogies.  No one can trace his lineage back to Elmer Fudd or Pecos Bill, yet the Bible details a genealogy from Adam to Jesus Himself.

What reason is there to take it as figurative?

So, we might ask, from where does anyone get the notion that the Genesis account ought to be taken figuratively.  Quite simply, it comes from teachings based on a portion of scientific inquiry that purports irrefutable evidence of an old earth.  

It is fairly easy to see that a literal interpretation of Genesis does not fit with a very old earth.  The assumption is made, for whatever reason, that it must be the irrefutable scientific evidence that is correct.  The question, then, is what to do with Genesis, and this is answered by reinterpreting it figuratively.

The main problem with this is the assumption of the truthfulness regarding the selective data that purports irrefutable evidence of an old earth.  The problems and inconsistencies in the evidence are not given to the general public, but appear to be deliberately withheld.  Neither are the lines of scientific evidence that point to a young earth given to the general public.  To be truly scientific, all the evidence and all the data should be made available to all students.  Theological assumptions made by individual scientist, whether they be Theistic or Atheistic, should be withheld.  True science has no ax to grind other than the truth it seeks to find, so it should welcome all inquiry and debate.

Conclusion

So, the Genesis account does not give any indication of requiring figurative interpretation.  It actually details a very logical and orderly creation.  Other places in Scripture reference the six days of creation.  Finally, the figurative interpretation doesn't make any sense.

So I would like to understand the case for believing the Genesis creation account, among all Biblical texts, is one that is intended to be interpreted literally. I'm not interested in scientific evidence for a young-earth in these answers. I'm interested in Biblical or historical reasons why this text, as a whole (as opposed to individual words), should be considered literal.

I would also discourage answers that address specific words in the Genesis account (such as the Hebrew 'yom'), but if that is the strongest evidence you have, then I won't consider it an invalid answer.
","No textual reason for interpreting Genesis figuratively

Whenever we ask why we should take something in the Bible as literal, we must start by asking ask why we should not take it as literal.  Does the text give us any reason to interpret it as being figurative?  In the book of Revelation, and other places where mortal man is given a glimpse of eternity, descriptions employ the use of comparison quite frequently.  It was like this or had the appearance of that.  The Genesis account employs no such language.  

(By the way, the assumption that the Song of Solomon is figuratively is certainly debatable.)

The Order of Genesis

In fact, the Genesis account is written as if it were an actual account with a very logical order.  There are six distinct units in which creative works take place.  Each of these units is described as a day, with an evening and a morning.  (The Jewish and Muslim traditions still follow this pattern by marking sundown as the beginning of the next day.)

Genesis 1:2 identifies the nature of the earth:


  The earth was without form and void, and darkness was over the
  face of the deep. And the Spirit of God was hovering over the face of
  the waters.  Genesis 1:2 ESV


I have heard this original state of ""without form and void"" paraphrased as unformed and unfilled.  The first three days of Genesis are dedicated to forming while the second three days are dedicated to filling.  What is formed on the first day is filled on the 4th days, whatever is formed on the 2nd day is filled on the 5th, and so forth.  So, there are specific divisions that represent a very orderly process, which aligns better with an actual record rather than a figurative story.

Confirmation of Scripture

As Warren noted, other places in Scripture affirm the six days of creation.


  Six days you shall labor and do all your work, but the seventh day is
  a sabbath of the LORD your God .. For in six days the LORD made the
  heavens and the earth, the sea and all that is in them, and rested on
  the seventh day.  Exodus 20:8-11 NASB


Problems with figurative interpretations

Finally, the figurative interpretation breaks down.  If a days is a billion years, then how did flowers get pollinated when there were no bees in existence for another billion years?  Also, if the sixth day is a billion years from Adam, then we have not yet reached the 7th day of God's rest, since we have a genealogy from Adam that is roughly 6,000 years.  Fictitious characters do not have genealogies.  No one can trace his lineage back to Elmer Fudd or Pecos Bill, yet the Bible details a genealogy from Adam to Jesus Himself.

What reason is there to take it as figurative?

So, we might ask, from where does anyone get the notion that the Genesis account ought to be taken figuratively.  Quite simply, it comes from teachings based on a portion of scientific inquiry that purports irrefutable evidence of an old earth.  

It is fairly easy to see that a literal interpretation of Genesis does not fit with a very old earth.  The assumption is made, for whatever reason, that it must be the irrefutable scientific evidence that is correct.  The question, then, is what to do with Genesis, and this is answered by reinterpreting it figuratively.

The main problem with this is the assumption of the truthfulness regarding the selective data that purports irrefutable evidence of an old earth.  The problems and inconsistencies in the evidence are not given to the general public, but appear to be deliberately withheld.  Neither are the lines of scientific evidence that point to a young earth given to the general public.  To be truly scientific, all the evidence and all the data should be made available to all students.  Theological assumptions made by individual scientist, whether they be Theistic or Atheistic, should be withheld.  True science has no ax to grind other than the truth it seeks to find, so it should welcome all inquiry and debate.

Conclusion

So, the Genesis account does not give any indication of requiring figurative interpretation.  It actually details a very logical and orderly creation.  Other places in Scripture reference the six days of creation.  Finally, the figurative interpretation doesn't make any sense.

5452,5452,8653,local AJAX-call to remote site works in Safari but not in other browsers,"I am maintaining a website that uses Javascript. The script uses jQuery and loads some content from the server at which the site is normally hosted.

Just for convenience while maintaining the site, I run a local copy of the site on my iMac. This works perfectly fine when I use Safari. But Firefox, Opera and Chrome refuse to work. I guess it is because of cross-domain-policy. (I couldn't test this with IE, because IE has to run in a virtual machine on my iMac, so for this reason it is not possible to access any local files)

Is there a setting within Firefox and the other browsers where I can tell the browser that it is ok to ajax-load files that are located on a remote server from a local html-page with a local javascript?

In a nutshell: This my html-page:

&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;meta charset=""UTF-8""&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;some title&lt;/title&gt;
        &lt;link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""../css/stylesheet.css""&gt;
        &lt;script src=""../js/jquery-2.1.3.min.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
        &lt;script src=""../js/myScript.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;!-- some content with a div-container to receive the ajax-content --&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;


This is myScript.js:

var errorMsg = function (msg) {
    //insert the message into the html-page
};

var JSONerror = function (jqXHR, textStatus, errorThrown ) {
    var msg = 'JSON-answer: '+jqXHR.responseText;
    msg += '&lt;br&gt;'+'JSON-Errorstatus: '+textStatus;
    if ($.type(errorThrown) === 'string') {
        msg += '&lt;br&gt;'+'Error: '+errorThrown;
    }
    errorMsg(msg);
};

var JSONreceive = function (JSONobj, StatusString, jqXHR) {
    //insert the data in JSONobj into the html-page
}

var StartAJAX = function () {
    $.ajax({
        url: 'http://my.domain.tld/cgi-bin/myPerlScript.pl',
        data: ""lastID="" + lastID
           + '&amp;qkz=' + Math.random(),
           dataType: ""json"",
           success: JSONreceive,
           error: JSONerror
    });
};


There is also an event-listener, that listens for page-scroll and resize and checks some other constraints (like: is there already an ajax-call in progress?). This listener calls StartAJAX.

When it calls StartAJAX on a local copy of my page (file:///User/...) within Safari, I get the Ajax-content perfectly fine inserted into my html-document. within the other browsers i get the error-message inserted into the html-page. It is:


  JSON-Answer: undefined
  JSON-Errorstatus: error
  Error:


Why does it work in Safari but not in Firefox, Chrome and Opera?  

How can I make those browsers work?

(I need to test it with all browsers, because all browsers render the same html-domument differently, but I don't want to upload all files to the server after every change just to test it.)

EDIT:

After reading some answers, I want to make something clear, that I obviously did not make clear enough:

I am searching for settings in Webbrowsers


I will NOT change the settings of my remote webserver (Apache)
I will NOT manipulate any files on my remote machine (.htaccess)
I will NOT set up a webserver on my local iMac
I will NOT change the code of the AJAX-calls in my Javascript-files
I will NOT change the code of the Perl-Scripts on my remote Server


I can tell you why:

I am just doing a short maintainance, and i am too lazy to upload every manipulated file to the remote machine after I edited it. The settings of the webserver are fine for actual operation. I don't want to change them (and maybe forget the changes before finishing my work). Same for the scripts: Those parts that some of you want to change work fine as they are now. There is no reason to touch the Ajax-Calls, because there is nothing wrong with them in the productive environment.

All I want is that those stupid browsers Firefox, Opera and Chrome behave like Safari and process the Ajax-calls correctly.

BTW:

Please can anyone explain what is so risky to call data via Ajax from an other domain in Firefox, Opera or Chrome while it seems to be harmless doing the same thing in Safari?

I suspect there is a dimmer switch somewhere, probably on the steering column. Hopefully you can get at the connector to check it without removing the lower dash or dropping the steering column.  If you know what wires go where, you can jumper the appropriate connectors to simulate a working switch set to low beam.

5598,5598,8884,A helical cycloid?,"While combing around my notes looking for other possible examples for this question, I chanced upon another one of my unsolved problems:

Cycloidal curves are curves generated by a circle rolling upon a plane or space curve. It's not too hard to derive the required parametric equations if the fixed curve is a plane curve, but I've had some trouble deriving the corresponding expression for space curves.

More specifically, here is the particular problem I was concerned with: consider a (cylindrical) helix:

$$\begin{align*}x&amp;=a\cos\;t\\y&amp;=a\sin\;t\\z&amp;=ct\end{align*}$$

and imagine a circle of radius $r$ whose plane is always perpendicular to the x-y plane rolling on the helix, starting at the point $(a,0,0)$ ($t=0$). Imagine a point in the plane of the circle at a distance $hr$ from the center. What are the parametric equations for the locus of the point?

The two obvious pieces of information I have are that the center of the circle also traces a helix, whose parametric equation differs from the original by a vertical shift of $r$ (per Tony, that was an erroneous assumption), and that the expression for the arclength of the helix, $s=\sqrt{a^2+c^2}t$, should figure into the final parametric equations. Otherwise, I'm not sure how to start.

How does one derive parametric equations for the ""helical cycloid""?



The physical model I had in mind was a screw ramp winding around a cylinder. Supposing that there was a car that needed to go to the top of the cylinder by driving on the ramp, and supposing that a spot is placed on one of the car's wheels, what are the equations for the locus of the spot?
",J. M. is not a mathematician,https://math.stackexchange.com/users/498,"I like to think of helices on cylinders as images of lines under planar curling, so here's an approach incorporating that idea.

Imagine the circle rolling up a line drawn in the plane, with $P$ the point of tangency along the line and $Q$ a distinguished point on the circumference of the circle. (So, $Q$ traces out a cycloid in the plane.) Now, imagine the plane is made of thin paper, but the circle is made of stiff cardboard. If we curl the plane into a cylinder but the circle remains flat, the plane of the circle will be tangent to the cylinder along the (vertical) line passing through the point $P$. The point $P$ will follow a helix, and the point $Q$ --which lies in the plane of the circle-- traces out the helical cycloid in space. While the path that $P$ (and $Q$) takes is decidedly different after curling than before, the displacement vector between $P$ and $Q$ in the plane of the circle is the same throughout. 

Before curling, if the circle of radius $r$ rolls along a horizontal track in the $uv$-plane, then we have $P=(r t, 0)$, and the point $Q$ traces out the standard cycloid:

$$\begin{align}
u &amp;= r ( t - \sin t ) \\
v &amp;= r ( 1 - \cos t )
\end{align}$$

The displacement vector from $P$ to $Q$ at time $t$ is given by

$$d := PQ = [m, n] = r[-\sin t, 1 - \cos t ] = - 2 r \sin\frac{t}{2} \; [\cos\frac{t}{2},-\sin\frac{t}{2}]$$

Rotating the plane through an angle, say, $\theta := \rm{atan\frac{c}{a}}$, and writing $b$ for $\sqrt{a^2+c^2}$, the circle's point of tangency along the tilted track is given by ...

$$P_2 = (r t \cos\theta,r t \sin\theta) = \left( \frac{r t a}{b}, \frac{r t c}{b}\right)$$

... and the displacement vector, $d_2$, to the point $Q_2$ tracing out the tilted cycloid is given by ...

$$\begin{align}
d_2 :&amp;= [m \cos\theta - n \sin \theta, m \sin\theta + n \cos \theta ] \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{b} [a m - c n, c m + a n] \\
&amp;= -\frac{2r}{b}\sin\frac{t}{2}\left[\cos\left(\theta-\frac{t}{2}\right), \sin\left(\theta - \frac{t}{2} \right) \right] \\
\end{align}$$ 

Now the fun part: Curl the $(u,v)$-plane around a cylinder of radius $a$, such that the $uv$-origin aligns with the $xyz$-point $(a,0,0)$ and the $v$-axis runs parallel to the $z$ axis. The curled, tilted track will coincide with a helix. The horizontal distance travelled by $P_2$ in the plane becomes the length of horizontal circular arc travelled by $P_3$ around the cylinder; upon dividing by the radius, $a$, of the cylinder, this length becomes the angular ""distance"" --$s := \frac{rt}{b}$-- travelled by $P_3$; the vertical distances match. Therefore: 

$$P_3 = \left(a\cos s, a\sin s, \frac{rtc}{b} \right)=(a\cos s,a\sin s,c s)$$

As for the displacement vector: The $u$ direction of the tangent plane coincides with the horizontal vector tangent to the cylinder at $P_3$; the $v$ direction coincides with the $z$ direction. Thus, the transformation from $uv$-coordinates to $xyz$-coordinates is given by 

$$[1,0]\to[-\sin s, \cos s, 0]\hspace{0.5in}[0,1]\to[0,0,1]$$

The image, $d_3$, of the displacement vector $d_2$, then, is 

$$d_3 = -\frac{2r}{b}\sin\frac{t}{2}\left[-\sin s \cos\left(\theta-\frac{t}{2}\right), \cos s \cos\left(\theta-\frac{t}{2}\right), \sin\left(\theta - \frac{t}{2} \right) \right] $$

and the path of $Q_3$, which traces the helical cycloid, is given by

$$
Q_3 = P_3 + d_3 = \left\{
\begin{align}
x &amp;= a \cos s &amp;+ \frac{2 r}{b} \sin s \sin\frac{bs}{2r} \cos\left(\theta-\frac{bs}{2r}\right)\\
y &amp;= a \sin s &amp;- \frac{2 r}{b} \cos s \sin\frac{bs}{2r} \cos\left(\theta-\frac{bs}{2r}\right)\\
z &amp;= c s &amp;- \frac{2 r}{b} \sin\frac{b s}{2r}\sin\left(\theta-\frac{bs}{2r}\right)
\end{align}
\right.
$$

Here's a picture with $a=c=1$ and $r=1/2$:



Note: The above does not simply curl the planar cycloid around the cylinder. Since

$$x^2 + y^2 = a^2 + \frac{4r^2}{b^2} \sin^2\frac{bs}{2r} \cos^2\left(\theta-\frac{bs}{2r}\right) \ge a^2$$

we see that most of the helical cycloid lies outside the surface of the cylinder.

4758,4758,7550,local AJAX-call to remote site works in Safari but not in other browsers,"I am maintaining a website that uses Javascript. The script uses jQuery and loads some content from the server at which the site is normally hosted.

Just for convenience while maintaining the site, I run a local copy of the site on my iMac. This works perfectly fine when I use Safari. But Firefox, Opera and Chrome refuse to work. I guess it is because of cross-domain-policy. (I couldn't test this with IE, because IE has to run in a virtual machine on my iMac, so for this reason it is not possible to access any local files)

Is there a setting within Firefox and the other browsers where I can tell the browser that it is ok to ajax-load files that are located on a remote server from a local html-page with a local javascript?

In a nutshell: This my html-page:

&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;meta charset=""UTF-8""&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;some title&lt;/title&gt;
        &lt;link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""../css/stylesheet.css""&gt;
        &lt;script src=""../js/jquery-2.1.3.min.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
        &lt;script src=""../js/myScript.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;!-- some content with a div-container to receive the ajax-content --&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;


This is myScript.js:

var errorMsg = function (msg) {
    //insert the message into the html-page
};

var JSONerror = function (jqXHR, textStatus, errorThrown ) {
    var msg = 'JSON-answer: '+jqXHR.responseText;
    msg += '&lt;br&gt;'+'JSON-Errorstatus: '+textStatus;
    if ($.type(errorThrown) === 'string') {
        msg += '&lt;br&gt;'+'Error: '+errorThrown;
    }
    errorMsg(msg);
};

var JSONreceive = function (JSONobj, StatusString, jqXHR) {
    //insert the data in JSONobj into the html-page
}

var StartAJAX = function () {
    $.ajax({
        url: 'http://my.domain.tld/cgi-bin/myPerlScript.pl',
        data: ""lastID="" + lastID
           + '&amp;qkz=' + Math.random(),
           dataType: ""json"",
           success: JSONreceive,
           error: JSONerror
    });
};


There is also an event-listener, that listens for page-scroll and resize and checks some other constraints (like: is there already an ajax-call in progress?). This listener calls StartAJAX.

When it calls StartAJAX on a local copy of my page (file:///User/...) within Safari, I get the Ajax-content perfectly fine inserted into my html-document. within the other browsers i get the error-message inserted into the html-page. It is:


  JSON-Answer: undefined
  JSON-Errorstatus: error
  Error:


Why does it work in Safari but not in Firefox, Chrome and Opera?  

How can I make those browsers work?

(I need to test it with all browsers, because all browsers render the same html-domument differently, but I don't want to upload all files to the server after every change just to test it.)

EDIT:

After reading some answers, I want to make something clear, that I obviously did not make clear enough:

I am searching for settings in Webbrowsers


I will NOT change the settings of my remote webserver (Apache)
I will NOT manipulate any files on my remote machine (.htaccess)
I will NOT set up a webserver on my local iMac
I will NOT change the code of the AJAX-calls in my Javascript-files
I will NOT change the code of the Perl-Scripts on my remote Server


I can tell you why:

I am just doing a short maintainance, and i am too lazy to upload every manipulated file to the remote machine after I edited it. The settings of the webserver are fine for actual operation. I don't want to change them (and maybe forget the changes before finishing my work). Same for the scripts: Those parts that some of you want to change work fine as they are now. There is no reason to touch the Ajax-Calls, because there is nothing wrong with them in the productive environment.

All I want is that those stupid browsers Firefox, Opera and Chrome behave like Safari and process the Ajax-calls correctly.

BTW:

Please can anyone explain what is so risky to call data via Ajax from an other domain in Firefox, Opera or Chrome while it seems to be harmless doing the same thing in Safari?
",Hubert Schölnast,https://stackoverflow.com/users/1302716,"To avoid this issues, you should develop your page (in your local computer it's ok) using a webserver (like apache, nginx, ...), so, your url ajax calls starts with the protocol http or https, not ""file"". ""File"" is the path of your file but using SO path system, not a web server system.

In the other hand, browsers has ""Same Origin Policy"". This is a security feature but what are the ""problems"" in web development using ajax calls? Well, your ajax calls always be done to the same server, for example, if you have your web on domain ""http://my-domain.com"" then your ajax calls must be to the same domain ""http://my-domain.com"". 

To ""bypass"" SOP in ajax calls, you have three solutions:

The script uses jQuery and loads some content from the server at which the site is normally hosted.

Just for convenience while maintaining the site, I run a local copy of the site on my iMac. This works perfectly fine when I use Safari. But Firefox, Opera and Chrome refuse to work. I guess it is because of cross-domain-policy. (I couldn't test this with IE, because IE has to run in a virtual machine on my iMac, so for this reason it is not possible to access any local files)

Is there a setting within Firefox and the other browsers where I can tell the browser that it is ok to ajax-load files that are located on a remote server from a local html-page with a local javascript?

In a nutshell: This my html-page:

&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;meta charset=""UTF-8""&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;some title&lt;/title&gt;
        &lt;link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""../css/stylesheet.css""&gt;
        &lt;script src=""../js/jquery-2.1.3.min.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
        &lt;script src=""../js/myScript.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;!-- some content with a div-container to receive the ajax-content --&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;


This is myScript.js:

var errorMsg = function (msg) {
    //insert the message into the html-page
};

var JSONerror = function (jqXHR, textStatus, errorThrown ) {
    var msg = 'JSON-answer: '+jqXHR.responseText;
    msg += '&lt;br&gt;'+'JSON-Errorstatus: '+textStatus;
    if ($.type(errorThrown) === 'string') {
        msg += '&lt;br&gt;'+'Error: '+errorThrown;
    }
    errorMsg(msg);
};

var JSONreceive = function (JSONobj, StatusString, jqXHR) {
    //insert the data in JSONobj into the html-page
}

var StartAJAX = function () {
    $.ajax({
        url: 'http://my.domain.tld/cgi-bin/myPerlScript.pl',
        data: ""lastID="" + lastID
           + '&amp;qkz=' + Math.random(),
           dataType: ""json"",
           success: JSONreceive,
           error: JSONerror
    });
};


There is also an event-listener, that listens for page-scroll and resize and checks some other constraints (like: is there already an ajax-call in progress?). This listener calls StartAJAX.

When it calls StartAJAX on a local copy of my page (file:///User/...) within Safari, I get the Ajax-content perfectly fine inserted into my html-document. within the other browsers i get the error-message inserted into the html-page. It is:


  JSON-Answer: undefined
  JSON-Errorstatus: error
  Error:


Why does it work in Safari but not in Firefox, Chrome and Opera?  

How can I make those browsers work?

(I need to test it with all browsers, because all browsers render the same html-domument differently, but I don't want to upload all files to the server after every change just to test it.)

EDIT:

After reading some answers, I want to make something clear, that I obviously did not make clear enough:

I am searching for settings in Webbrowsers


I will NOT change the settings of my remote webserver (Apache)
I will NOT manipulate any files on my remote machine (.htaccess)
I will NOT set up a webserver on my local iMac
I will NOT change the code of the AJAX-calls in my Javascript-files
I will NOT change the code of the Perl-Scripts on my remote Server


I can tell you why:

I am just doing a short maintainance, and i am too lazy to upload every manipulated file to the remote machine after I edited it. The settings of the webserver are fine for actual operation. I don't want to change them (and maybe forget the changes before finishing my work). Same for the scripts: Those parts that some of you want to change work fine as they are now. There is no reason to touch the Ajax-Calls, because there is nothing wrong with them in the productive environment.

All I want is that those stupid browsers Firefox, Opera and Chrome behave like Safari and process the Ajax-calls correctly.

BTW:

Please can anyone explain what is so risky to call data via Ajax from an other domain in Firefox, Opera or Chrome while it seems to be harmless doing the same thing in Safari?
","To avoid this issues, you should develop your page (in your local computer it's ok) using a webserver (like apache, nginx, ...), so, your url ajax calls starts with the protocol http or https, not ""file"". ""File"" is the path of your file but using SO path system, not a web server system.

In the other hand, browsers has ""Same Origin Policy"". This is a security feature but what are the ""problems"" in web development using ajax calls? Well, your ajax calls always be done to the same server, for example, if you have your web on domain ""http://my-domain.com"" then your ajax calls must be to the same domain ""http://my-domain.com"". 

To ""bypass"" SOP in ajax calls, you have three solutions:


Create a proxy on your ""my-domain.com"" that use curl (in php for example) to retrieve the data and return it to your ajax call
Use JSON-P
Allow your domain in your webserver (.htaccess for example) setting a proper configuration to CORS: http://enable-cors.org/

",nomis,https://tex.stackexchange.com/users/82319,"A specialised tree-drawing library or package would make this task much easier and allow you to specify the tree much more concisely. Various options are available e.g. qtree (non-TikZ), tikz-qtree (like qtree but in TikZ), forest (based on TikZ) etc.

forest is the most powerful and probably the best choice here. (But I am biased.)

\usepackage{forest}


For convenience, we set up 2 styles for the edges: my edge is the basic style with an arrow; 0 my edge is a dashed variant of my edge. We define these with \tikzset making them available both when customising the style of the BDT diagram and when tweaking it for the BDD version.

\usetikzlibrary{arrows.meta}
\tikzset{
  0 my edge/.style={densely dashed, my edge},
  my edge/.style={-{Stealth[]}},
}


We now set up a style suitable for drawing BDTs of the kind shown:

\forestset{
  BDT/.style={
    for tree={
      if n children=0{}{circle},% use a circle unless there are 0 children
      draw,% draw every node
      edge={
        my edge,% use the my edge style for edges (with the arrow)
      },
      if n=1{
        edge+={0 my edge},% if the child is the first one, add the 0 my edge style (dashed)
      }{},
      font=\sffamily,% use sans serif for node text
    }
  },
}


The BDT is then straightforward:

\begin{forest}
  BDT
  [a
    [b
      [c
        [d
          [0]
          [0]
        ]
        [d
          [0]
          [1]
        ]
      ]
      [c
        [d
          [0]
          [0]
        ]
        [d
          [0]
          [1]
        ]
      ]
    ]
    [b
      [c
        [d
          [0]
          [0]
        ]
        [d
          [0]
          [1]
        ]
      ]
      [c
        [d
          [1]
          [1]
        ]
        [d
          [1]
          [1]
        ]
      ]
    ]
  ]
\end{forest}




For instructions explaining how to specify a tree in bracket notation see my explanation in this answer.

The BDD is a bit more complex and I'm not sure if I understand what is essential to the diagram and what not. Some arrows are curved, for example, but some not and I'm not always sure why.

To ensure consistency, we use the BDT style and then use two methods to tweak the code:


,phantom makes a node a 'phantom' node which affects how other nodes are spaced without being visible itself. We use these for the 'missing' nodes.
tikz={} allows you to specify TikZ code which will be run after the rest of the tree is drawn. We can use this for the arrows which skip levels. We can specify the current node using (). The other node can either be named using name= - as in the case of my one in the code below - or be specified relative to the current node by using a ! node name. In this case, we use !l1 to specify the current-node's-last-child's-first-child when drawing the arrows from a and c.


Then we can write:

\begin{forest}
  BDT
  [a, tikz={\draw [0 my edge] () [bend right] to (!l1.north) ;}
    [,phantom]
    [b, tikz={\draw [my edge] () [bend left] to (my one.north) ;}
      [c, tikz={\draw [0 my edge] () [bend right] to (!l1.north) ;}
        [,phantom]
        [d
          [0]
          [1, name=my one]
        ]
      ]
      [,phantom]
    ]
  ]
\end{forest}




If you need the line from b to be a straight vertical drop, you can adjust the tree but it is a little more complex. Since the other 'skipping' arrows are curved, I don't do this as there's no obvious reason to think it necessary.

","A specialised tree-drawing library or package would make this task much easier and allow you to specify the tree much more concisely. Various options are available e.g. qtree (non-TikZ), tikz-qtree (like qtree but in TikZ), forest (based on TikZ) etc.

forest is the most powerful and probably the best choice here. (But I am biased.)

\usepackage{forest}


For convenience, we set up 2 styles for the edges: my edge is the basic style with an arrow; 0 my edge is a dashed variant of my edge. We define these with \tikzset making them available both when customising the style of the BDT diagram and when tweaking it for the BDD version.

\usetikzlibrary{arrows.meta}
\tikzset{
  0 my edge/.style={densely dashed, my edge},
  my edge/.style={-{Stealth[]}},
}


We now set up a style suitable for drawing BDTs of the kind shown:

\forestset{
  BDT/.style={
    for tree={
      if n children=0{}{circle},% use a circle unless there are 0 children
      draw,% draw every node
      edge={
        my edge,% use the my edge style for edges (with the arrow)
      },
      if n=1{
        edge+={0 my edge},% if the child is the first one, add the 0 my edge style (dashed)
      }{},
      font=\sffamily,% use sans serif for node text
    }
  },
}


The BDT is then straightforward:

\begin{forest}
  BDT
  [a
    [b
      [c
        [d
          [0]
          [0]
        ]
        [d
          [0]
          [1]
        ]
      ]
      [c
        [d
          [0]
          [0]
        ]
        [d
          [0]
          [1]
        ]
      ]
    ]
    [b
      [c
        [d
          [0]
          [0]
        ]
        [d
          [0]
          [1]
        ]
      ]
      [c
        [d
          [1]
          [1]
        ]
        [d
          [1]
          [1]
        ]
      ]
    ]
  ]
\end{forest}




For instructions explaining how to specify a tree in bracket notation see my explanation in this answer.

The BDD is a bit more complex and I'm not sure if I understand what is essential to the diagram and what not. Some arrows are curved, for example, but some not and I'm not always sure why.

To ensure consistency, we use the BDT style and then use two methods to tweak the code:


,phantom makes a node a 'phantom' node which affects how other nodes are spaced without being visible itself. We use these for the 'missing' nodes.
tikz={} allows you to specify TikZ code which will be run after the rest of the tree is drawn. We can use this for the arrows which skip levels. We can specify the current node using (). The other node can either be named using name= - as in the case of my one in the code below - or be specified relative to the current node by using a ! node name. In this case, we use !l1 to specify the current-node's-last-child's-first-child when drawing the arrows from a and c.


Then we can write:

\begin{forest}
  BDT
  [a, tikz={\draw [0 my edge] () [bend right] to (!l1.north) ;}
    [,phantom]
    [b, tikz={\draw [my edge] () [bend left] to (my one.north) ;}
      [c, tikz={\draw [0 my edge] () [bend right] to (!l1.north) ;}
        [,phantom]
        [d
          [0]
          [1, name=my one]
        ]
      ]
      [,phantom]
    ]
  ]
\end{forest}




If you need the line from b to be a straight vertical drop, you can adjust the tree but it is a little more complex. Since the other 'skipping' arrows are curved, I don't do this as there's no obvious reason to think it necessary.

842,842,1340,Are mutliple database calls really significant with a network call for a web API?,"At one of my employers, we worked on a REST (but it also applies to SOAP) API. The client, which is the application UI, would make calls over the web (LAN in typical production deployments) to the API. The API would make calls to the database.

One theme that recurs in our discussions is performance: some people on the team believe that you should not have multiple database calls (usually reads) from a single API call because of performance; you should optimize them so that each API call has only (exactly) one database call.

But is that really important? Consider that the UI has to make a network call to the API; that's pretty big (order of magnitude of milliseconds). Databases are optimized to keep things in memory and execute reads very, very quickly (eg. SQL Server loads and keeps everything in RAM and consumes almost all your free RAM if it can).

TLDR: Is it really significant to worry about multiple database calls when we are already making a network call over the LAN? If so, why?

To be clear, I'm talking about order of magnitude -- I know that it depends on specifics (machine hardware, choice of API and DB, etc.) If I have a call that takes O(milliseconds), does optimizing for DB calls that take an order of magnitude less, actually matter? Or is there more to the problem than this?

Edit: for posterity, I think it's quite ridiculous to make claims that we need to improve performance by combining database calls under these circumstances -- especially with a lack of profiling.

4629,4629,7343,Where is my power going?,"We just got an overly large (several hundred dollars over normal) electric bill from the city.

Being a bit of a diy I picked up an ammeter to to track down the reason. None of my circuits are clocking in over 2 amps in normal usage. I tried powering up everything in the house including all of the major appliances. 

I only came up with a total of 22 amps, absolute max draw. US standard 110V.

I did the math but I wasn't able to crack our normal $150 / month (calculated out using the local kilowatt hour pricing).

What the heck is going on? Anything more for me to do before calling the electrician?

Edit:

The meter box is mounted to the side of the house, under a overhang.

When I used the ammeter I was working off the main hot line from the meter when I powered everything up. 

I did see the other diy post. 

We do have central air, howeverit was a lot cooler last month vs the same time last year. The usage shouldnt have spiked, at least that much.

The price per killowatt hour is comperable to last year as well.

We generally clock in at around 1200 to 1800 kilowatt hours. Last month was a bit over 2800.

We already tried (unsuccessfully) to lodge a complaint with the electric company.

The odd thing is the variance -$150 one month and near $1000 the next, with no noticible change in utilization patterns.

4380,4380,6967,What is the real reason for the Joker's scars?,"In The Dark Knight, The Joker told different reasons for the scars on his cheeks. Initially he said that his father gave him the cuts on his cheek as a child after his father performed the same act on his mother, which includes the famous line ""Why so serious?"".

The Joker also tells Rachel Dawes that his wife had scars due to an accident and that he cut his own cheeks with a razor blade to prove that scars did not matter. 

He starts to tell Batman a third story about how he might have been disfigured. 

Anybody knows what is the real reason?
Was the real reason mentioned in any comics or other books?


",Vijin Paulraj,https://movies.stackexchange.com/users/556,"The pure nature of the Joker, especially in the movie sense, is to be completely chaotic wanting ""to watch the world burn"".  In other words, the Joker is the very definition of the alignment: Chaotic Evil

In the movie, the conflicting stories about his past are there on purpose to continue this nature of just being an agent of chaos.  

Notice how we're never given a flashback of events during his story-telling, something very prominent in the movies in order to remind the audience of events past.  Even Ra's' origins were given flashbacks, although brief and nondescript. 

The only facts to his backgrounds are that he started in Gotham, pitting low-level criminals against each other in elaborate robbery schemes where he comes out on top, with money.  

As a point of reference, the opening scene of The Dark Knight shows his most recent attempt, with a lack of surprise from Gordon on the situation of criminals killing each other during a heist.

But this is only the past year (time between the end of Batman Begins and the beginning of The Dark Knight) and the rest of his timeline is what we see in the movie.

For clarification and emphasis of the answer:

There is no true origin of the Joker in any media.



As far as the comics, the same is true: 

There are a multitude of origins of the Joker told from being a washed up comedian that went nuts, to just being that way from the start.


  Though many have been related, a definitive history of the Joker has never been established in the comics, and his true name has never been confirmed. 
  
  No recounting of the Joker's origin has been definitive, however, as he has been portrayed as lying so often about his former life that he himself is confused as to what actually happened. As he says in The Killing Joke: ""Sometimes I remember it one way, sometimes another... if I'm going to have a past, I prefer it to be multiple choice!""


source

The one true constant of any depiction of the Joker is that he wants to assert to Batman that all it takes is One bad day to send anyone into the insanity that he lives everyday.  

The most prominent of this is during the short story The Killing Joke where he tortures Gordon almost to this point.

And this is also what makes the Joker such the notorious villain that he is.  No one can ever be certain of anything of him or what he will do.  Whether it be something as simplistic as his background to any of his plans, constantly fooling even the pinnacle of detectives like Batman on multiple occasions.



As a final side note about Joker origin, the story that is most accepted as the ""true"" origin is The Killing Joke Where he quits his job to be a comedian and goes completely nuts after being knocked into a vat of acid that bleaches his body the traditional Joker colours (all caused by Batman during a heist gone wrong).  

But as there is no confirmation of this origin to the Joker, even this can be taken with a grain of salt.


  The Dark Knight's interpretation of the Joker is based primarily on the character's first two appearances in the Batman comics, as well as Alan Moore's one-shot comic book Batman: The Killing Joke, which was given to Heath Ledger in order to prepare for his role.

I searched the settings up and down, and was quite surprised there were no SIP settings available. I'm very sure SIP support was added to AOSP with Gingerbread, so it had to be there with ICS!

Did LG remove them from their Android installation? Is there any way to get them back?
",Izzy,https://android.stackexchange.com/users/16575,"Is the SIP functionality really gone for good from the Optimus 4X?

Actually, LG really seems to think their (European?) customers don't need SIP. Most likely official argument will be that carriers either exclude SIP usage from their mobile data plans (at least here in Germany, many do). So they removed it.

Ooops. That was only half true: They removed it from the obvious places, that is. You might not find it in the settings. But luckily, they just removed the link to the settings screen -- all the code still seems to be there!

Ah! Still available! So how to access it?

I found it more accidentally while playing with Apex Launcher. Long pressing on a free space on one of the home screens, like you want to add a widget, opens the expected menu. Select ""Shortcuts"" here. On top of the next screen you'll find an item called ""Activities"", which I long ignored -- unfortunately! But after a very interesting chat session with Dan on broadcasts versus intents versus activities, I had to dig into this. And found that:

 
activities of the phone app (click images for larger variants)

The top entry in the first screenshot clearly reads Sip Settings -- so I added that shortcut to my homescreen. And what should I say? Yesss! It's the long missed settings screen, from where you can configure your SIP accounts (and define whether you want the device to listen for incoming SIP calls)!

So if you miss something that should be there, this might be a place to look for it. Besides, as reputated users as ASE we're always told to watch out for hidden gems in new places -- so you might want to look further:


list of apps with activities (click image for larger variant)

You see, other apps have also activities they made freely available (they might have even more which are kind of ""private"" to them). The numbers to the right tell you how much activities the corresponding app has made ""public"". Try them out! You surely will encounter the one or other force-close when you try to start such an activity (as it might expect parameters), but it cannot hurt. You might find other interesting things!

Are there other ways to discover/call such activities?

Sure, Apex is not the only one. There are other apps available on the playstore which let you explore available activities, such as e.g. Package Explorer or Stanley. And you also can use e.g. Tasker to start your discovered activities.

Besides: With that, most of the ""shortcut-apps"" available on the playstore you won't need any longer this way. Just inspect the Settings app, which seems to declare each and every page it has -- so you can directly jump there from your newly created shortcut!

Does this apply to the Optimus 4X only?

For sure not! This functionality should be available on any device. I just cannot promise you to find the SIP settings on all of them. Or anything else you've seen in above screenshots :)

Started thinking about what is really shown on the display and how
the pixels end up there.

No display can handle YCbCr-data so I guess everything gets converted
to RGB somewhere. YCbCr->RGB is however tricky business, see e.g.
http://www.fourcc.org/fccyvrgb.php

If I do the YCbCr- to RGB-conversion, am I guaranteed that the
pixel-values I have are the ones being displayed?

Short of getting a hardware-calibrated Eizo-display like the ones
shown here:

http://www.eizo.com/global/products/coloredge/



is there a way to have as much control as possible over the
""pipeline"" to the display (i.e. my pixels do not get converted on the
way) I'm thinking perhaps nvidia/gpu/opengl and moving everything as
close to the HW as possible; then for my graphic-card at least I know
what I'm looking at.

Is there a RGB-format that is native for graphics card and that doesn't require any further conversion? YCbCr is 8bpp and I'm thinking 32-bit RGB 4:4:4. 

I'm mainly on an linux-system if that makes a difference.
Currently I'm using http://www.libsdl.org/
There's also http://directfb.org/ but I haven't explored that path

  No display can handle YCbCr-data so I guess everything gets converted to RGB somewhere.


All displays use RGB. On LCDs each pixel consists of three subpixels in three basic colors. So you're right, everything must be converted to RGB to be displayed.


  If I do the YCbCr- to RGB-conversion, am I guaranteed that the pixel-values I have are the ones being displayed?


It depends what you mean. You are guaranteed that exact results of the conversion are displayed. So it depends on the results of conversion and those depend on the gamma you're using.


  is there a way to have as much control as possible over the ""pipeline"" to the display (i.e. my pixels do not get converted on the way) I'm thinking perhaps nvidia/gpu/opengl and moving everything as close to the HW as possible; then for my graphic-card at least I know what I'm looking at.


Once the image is converted to RGB, it's not modified anymore (unless you use f.lux or similar software). It doesn't really matter if it's closer to hardware or not, it's just a bunch of pixels and nothing will modify them after conversion to RGB (unless you ask something to, like with the mentioned f.lux, color correction software or video editing programs that can apply color filters).


  YCbCr is 8bpp and I'm thinking 32-bit RGB 4:4:4.


I think you're mixing few things up or I don't get what you mean. First, 32-bit RGB can't be 4:4:4, because you can't equally split 32 bits to 3 color channels. (10 bits for R, 11 bits for G, 11 bits for B?) 32-bit RGB actually consists of three 8-bit color channels and one 8-bit transparency channel. Videos don't have transparency, so they work with 24-bit RGB. (8 bits for each channel)

I don't know how YCbCr is saved in digital format, but I'm sure it's not 8-bit, at least assuming we're talking about total size of a pixel. (if you mean 8-bit color channels, then it's exactly as much as in RGB) 8-bit pixels could hold up to 256 colors. 24-bit RGB is over 16 million colors.


  Is there a RGB-format that is native for graphics card and that doesn't require any further conversion?


So you want raw, uncompressed RGB pixels? Well, there are such picture and video formats, but uncompressed videos take up really A LOT of space. Let's do a quick calculation for a 24-bit 24fps 1080p video:

3B * 1920px * 1080px * 24fps = 149299200B


So every second of raw uncompressed 1080p video weights over 140 MB. It means you could have up to 5 and a half minute of video on an industry-standard Blu-Ray disc. Not really a good deal I think ;)

Based on my research the difference should be minimal since we are already well indexed, and our internal links are fine, so Google is not going to apply a sitewide penalty for the 302s, which are, in effect, only the first link in the chain.
",Jordan Rieger,https://webmasters.stackexchange.com/users/27841,"I took a quick look at our latest keyword rankings report. This report is produced manually in-house based on the actual result rank we achieve for searches on Google for specific keyword phrases that we are targeting. (A top 10 rank is obviously desirable as it puts us on the first page of results, a top 6 is even better as it puts us above the fold on most monitors, and anything less than a top 50 is almost worthless because so few users click that far into the results.) Currently we are tracking 17 different phrases on a weekly basis. I think this report gives us the most direct way to measure our SEO results.

I compared our rankings on our August 2nd report to our August 15th report; the change went live on August 8th. The result is that out of 17 different phrases, only 2 improved in the rankings, 6 remained the same, and 9 decreased. Overall, the magnitude of the moves down and up were not terribly dramatic. Of course, in the time between the reports, we were also making the normal adjustments that any business makes to its content, and competitors were doing the same, so it's impossible to determine exactly how much difference the 301 made versus the 302 for us. But based on these results, the direct answer to my question about specific, immediate ranking benefit is that there probably is none. These results suggest that in the following situation, Google is smart enough to know that a 302 really means a 301:


302 is redirecting to the HTTPS version of the same URL
HTTP version is no longer accessible
Google search results are only showing HTTPS version, not HTTP
Google site tools still show some residual PageRank for the HTTP version (I discovered this after posting the question) possibly because external sites are still widely linking to your HTTP version


If your situation matches all the above criteria, there is reason to believe that Google is not penalizing you for the 302's. That agrees with the opinion of at least one SEO consultant company, who says: 


  Google recognizes that many people use 302 when they really mean 301.
  Fortunately, Google isn't bound by any law to take people literally.
  For the sake of producing the best possible search results, Google can
  and should look at 302s and figure out if the webmaster really means
  302, or if it's run-of-the-mill confusion and they really mean 301.


I would definitely like to see some more experiments 
situations where the 302 is consistently going to the HTTPS version of the exact same URL, and the HTTP version is no longer accessible. I found a similar experiment, with a slightly different situation, which proved that 302 does indeed confer some page rank, especially if the source and target pages are relevant to eachother. (In our situation, the pages were identical, which may explain why we were doing OK with the 302's.)

All that said, there is no good reason to use 302's for permanent redirects if you can help it, and we will be sticking with 301's. In our case, our ASP.Net code was doing the redirects via Response.Redirect(), and the default behavior in ASP.Net is to use a 302. Only with .NET 4.0 did Microsoft add a convenient Response.RedirectPemanent() method. Until then you had to manually write the 301 header, PHP-style, and most of our developers did not bother since they were used to redirects within application workflows, to which 302's are well suited.

",musicinmusic,https://music.stackexchange.com/users/12741,"Trumpet - sort of. Trombone - absolutely not.

The reason is that with a trumpet you have 8 possible fingerings, and for each there is a limited number of tones from which to choose by lip pressure. As a beginner you will only need the lower tones, which are spaced so far apart that it's extremely hard to hit the wrong one without noticing. Only getting a clean intonation might be tricky for you because it involves having precisely the right amount of lip pressure to get the intended result - so you have to hear whether the intonation is right. (I don't think this is a big issue with the guitar once it has been tuned.)

With the trombone, instead of fingering you'd have to find exactly the right spot on a continuous scale. That's harder than hitting the right tone when singing. Of course if you have a musical ear and there is merely something wrong with your vocal cords, then this is not an issue either.

I want to measure the performance of the current configuration and the new configuration as I move each database over and ensure that I am not starting to hit any disk performance issues (or see if I am actually increasing the performance).

There are a bunch of posts on the internet on SQL performance counters such as this one, but I am really interested in just the few that are related to network/disk usage and any latency or limits that associated with disk reads/writes.  What are some of the important SQL or Windows performance counters that I should look at to create a current baseline/comparison for iSCSI disk access for SQL?

More to the point, upon exporting as a .PNG, I noticed a resolution option. Me being the little derp that I am, I figured a larger resolution is always better, so I set this to high (300 ppi).

Upon importing the images into my project however, I realized that the images had become a lot larger than they should be. Upon tweaking the export resolution setting, I noticed that if I set this to low (72 ppi), the images come out as the expected size. I was just wondering how I should expect this to effect my drawings. If I were to keep the high resolution images I exported at 300 ppi, am I always going to be forced to reduce their size afterwards by a certain amount? Otherwise, should I always stick to  72 ppi in order to keep the size of the image the same and to avoid needing to re-size things later?

Image quality is not so important in this case, so there probably isn't much reason for me to use anything higher than 72 ppi anyway. Just for the sake of learning however, I thought this would be a good question to ask.
",JimmyK,https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/users/21405,"You need to define what is ""your project"".

The main 2 projects are printed ones and electronic media.

If you are printing, work with phisical mesurements, and at the end you just export at 300ppi. (Or just leave it as vector format) But I'm almost sure that is not your case.

For electronic usage the ppi dosen't matter at all. Look for the pixel values. You need lets say an icon 128x128px, or a background 1920x500px.

If you are preparing icons for a web aplication you probably can use a vector based format like svg. That will keep the image resolution idependent. Another way to do it is to export them to a font based format.

But, again, first you need to define what is your project.



Edited.
In this case 72 ppi gives the same pixel size as the declared pixel size on my drawing. If you change the value to 300 ppi the program is re interpreting the size, transforming from 72ppi to inches and then again to 300ppi. So basicly just use 72ppi.

3132,3132,4990,Bulk exporting/archiving collections in Lightroom,"Is there any way to export images from my collections, where the images are automatically placed into a folder tree that mimics their collections?

I'm not comfortable with having all that organization data locked away in Lightroom -- I switch computers a lot and oftentimes data sidecars like Lightroom's DB get lost in the shuffle. I'd like to export all my images into folders that can then be fed into Crashplan, etc.

Ideally I want it to archive only images in each collection that match a Smart search criteria, like 4+ stars.

jF's Collection Publisher plugin looks nice but it has its own collection tree that must be maintained separately. This solution is not DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) enough for me: I don't want to maintain two separate hierarchies of collections.

EDIT: To clarify, let's assume I have images sorted in collections as such:

&lt; Collection root &gt;
    |- California
    |  |- Surfers
    |  |- Hipsters
    |  |- Beaches
    |- Holland
       |- Windmills
       |- Stroopwaffels
       |- Coffeeshops
       |- Grachten


I am looking for something that exports images into a folder tree identical to the one above, without any extra maintenance or work. So JPG or TIFF files would be exported/published to:

/Users/tom/Photography/California/Surfers
/Users/tom/Photography/California/Hipsters
/Users/tom/Photography/California/Beaches
/Users/tom/Photography/Holland/Windmills
/Users/tom/Photography/Holland/Stroopwaffels
/Users/tom/Photography/Holland/Coffeeshops
/Users/tom/Photography/Holland/Grachten


In accordance with the collections they live in in LR. jF's plugin is nice but it works from  its own collection tree, which makes it unsuitable for this kind of request.

I'm not comfortable with having all that organization data locked away in Lightroom -- I switch computers a lot and oftentimes data sidecars like Lightroom's DB get lost in the shuffle. I'd like to export all my images into folders that can then be fed into Crashplan, etc.

Ideally I want it to archive only images in each collection that match a Smart search criteria, like 4+ stars.

jF's Collection Publisher plugin looks nice but it has its own collection tree that must be maintained separately. This solution is not DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) enough for me: I don't want to maintain two separate hierarchies of collections.

EDIT: To clarify, let's assume I have images sorted in collections as such:

&lt; Collection root &gt;
    |- California
    |  |- Surfers
    |  |- Hipsters
    |  |- Beaches
    |- Holland
       |- Windmills
       |- Stroopwaffels
       |- Coffeeshops
       |- Grachten


I am looking for something that exports images into a folder tree identical to the one above, without any extra maintenance or work. So JPG or TIFF files would be exported/published to:

/Users/tom/Photography/California/Surfers
/Users/tom/Photography/California/Hipsters
/Users/tom/Photography/California/Beaches
/Users/tom/Photography/Holland/Windmills
/Users/tom/Photography/Holland/Stroopwaffels
/Users/tom/Photography/Holland/Coffeeshops
/Users/tom/Photography/Holland/Grachten


In accordance with the collections they live in in LR. jF's plugin is nice but it works from  its own collection tree, which makes it unsuitable for this kind of request.

2622,2622,4170,Have I Been Misplaying France in Diplomacy?,"France is considered one of the ""better"" countries to play in Diplomacy. That's true insofar as it a ""corner"" and not a ""center"" country like Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Italy.

In descending order, my favorite strategies are 1) Go for the Mediterranean, 2) Ally with England vs. Germany 3) Ally with Germany Vs. England. But I've found France a tough, frustrating country to play when one can't use a Mediterranean strategy (because of what's going on elsewhere). A couple examples:

In one game, England ""allied"" with me against Germany, than stabbed me, leading to a Franco-German alliance (my least favorite). Meanwhile, Italy stabbed Austria, A Venice-Trieste, and got two builds in 1901, three in 1902, and had her choice of allies: with Russia vs. Turkey and Germany, with England vs. France.

In another game, I had to ward off an Anglo-German invasion. But the English army that went to Belgium marched into the Ruhr, again leading to a Franco-German alliance. But by the time we reshuffled the alliance, Austria-Hungary had stabbed Italy, overextended in a Lepanto opening, captured Venice and Rome, and dominated the Med. With Turkey, Italy, and the Balkans, Austria and Russia had the 18 centers to declare themselves co-winners.

Have I been misplaying France? Or has my inability to control the Med been due to my northern troubles, and the Austro-Italian imbalances? Can I hope for a more ""fortunate"" result playing France in future games, against, say, random opponents?
",Tom Au,https://boardgames.stackexchange.com/users/1344,"It sounds to me like both games you've failed to negotiate an alliance with England.  That isn't necessarily your fault, but in order to concentrate on the Med you would need to at least be able to negotiate a neutral England, if not an entirely friendly one.

Some ideas you might want to try


It sounds like in both games you stumbled into an FG alliance that was not in a strong position.  You might do better if you attempted to negotiate the FG alliance from the start.  That way you can be directing the flow of the conflict, rather than reacting to it.
England is likely worried that in an EF alliance, F usually grows faster and is in a more solid position after taking down Germany, while E ends up overextended.  So you'll likely need to give him the better side of the split, and make it clear that you are committing to the South so that E knows he isn't the next target.  You can also make things easier by making sure that England has a good path to grow after the initial attack on Germany, which generally means you want a weak Russia.  At the same time, don't make yourself too inviting of a target for E.  Many alliances are broken due to people who are too trusting and make it too easy for their partner to stab.


The more you play Diplomacy, the more you realize that none of the countries are really better than the others, so don't get frustrated that you didn't get a good result while playing a ""strong"" country.  Focus on where your negotiations failed to bring the results you wanted, and try to improve on that in your next game.

333,333,533,Is OTP useful in modern electronic communication?,"I have seen from time to time questions about various OTP schemes and ""OTP"" (i.e. stream cipher) schemes. The most common OTP troubles appear to be:


How to extend size of previously generated key or how to generate key.
How to get key material securely to the recipient.


In electronic communication or storage encryption OTP appears scheme that is impossible to make work and if it works benefits are not clear. Requirement that the key needs to be the same size than input seems to be unbearable for many of modern use cases for encryption.

Is there any practice where OTP is useful in modern cryptography except:


As a component used on some proofs.
As a example ideal of encryption algorithm.


I.e.: Is it possible to base on OTP and provide the ""information theoretic"" strength to hashing (apparently not), authentication, etc.
",user4982,https://crypto.stackexchange.com/users/4982,"The OTP is more a theoretical construction than a real world construction. The OTP suffers from three core problems:


Key Generation.
Key Distribution.
Key Destruction.


Let's deal with each one in turn.

Key Generation 

Key generation is surprisingly difficult. In order to get the full security proof for the OTP, you need to each bit to be independent of every other bit and for there to be no bias whatsoever in the output.

Now practically every hardware RNG you're going to get does not fufil this in practice. They almost always run the bits through a hash function or some sort of entropy extraction routine. However, these routines do not carry a security proof that they preserve the underlying independent non-bias nature of the bits passed to them. 

It's quite possible that if you the entropy extraction routine over enough bits, that a very small bias would be observed. However, any such bias, no matter how small would destroy the OTP security proof. 

So you need to design your own RNG using only de-biasing techniques that maintain the security proof. Worse, you need to build an RNG with no detectable bias whatsoever over gigabits of output. 

Key Distribution 

Key distribution is a pain because the key has to be as long as the message. This immediately raises the question of why bother with encryption if you already have a secure channel of transmitting the key. Even with this massive key you haven't authenticated the cipher-text! You need provisions for that too.

This limits the OTP to scenarios where you want to time-shift a secure channel. It works okay in scenarios like the following. If Alice lives in Hong Kong and Bob lives in New York, they can meet twice a year and exchange a gigabyte or two of pad and be on their way.

Even if you're using QKD you've just moved the problem elsewhere. The problem now moves from a key distribution problem to an engineering problem. You've got to make a QKD device that is 100% reliable, doesn't have any side channel attacks, and is not susceptible to induced errors. Such as slightly overpowering/underpowering device to get duplicate photons, shinning a laser at the device to subtly break it or some other error inducing attack. 

You've got many of the same problems of hardware quality as you had with the PRG. Good luck with that!

Key Destruction

Once you've used the key you have to make sure it is properly destroyed in both places. This is again more tricky than it seems at first. 

If you don't do this properly and you use the key-stream twice, you have no security at all. If the program that manages the pad for you suffers some sort of error and fails to delete the used portion of the pad then re-use becomes quite likely.  

Worse, because the pad is the same length as the message there's quite a lot of key stream to leak. This can leak in a number of ways. Parts of the key stream might have been paged to disk, for example, during encryption/decryption process. 

An attacker could then decipher parts of your ciphertext by simply XORing bytes from your recovered hard-drive against the ciphertext. 

Conclusion

The reason that the OTP isn't really fielded is that despite its strong security proof, the practical considerations around it actually render it insecure. 

This is actually quite common in cryptography. Things with strong security proofs tend to be unworkable.   

For every section of my reply, there is a documented case where precisely the problem I've raised has led to OTP messages being compromised. 

OTPs are really hard to use properly and are typically less secure overall than a conventional scheme. 

Small secrets, by virtue of them being small, are less likely to be leaked, easier to generate, easier to destroy and easier to transmit. All of these properties make them more secure.

request.form.get(""comment"")


the value of the text field is passed. what I can't figure out is how to get the value of the id.

so when the form is sent we could then tell from which form the info was coming from was coming  because each form has a unique id. In this case the id is number_one

so how do we go about getting the actual literal value of the id and not the text input?

If you need to identify the field, you'll have to either add the id to the input element name, or if the id is generated by Javascript code, perhaps store the information in an extra hidden field.

Adding the id to the name could be done with a delimiter perhaps:

5470,5470,8687,local AJAX-call to remote site works in Safari but not in other browsers,"I am maintaining a website that uses Javascript. The script uses jQuery and loads some content from the server at which the site is normally hosted.

Just for convenience while maintaining the site, I run a local copy of the site on my iMac. This works perfectly fine when I use Safari. But Firefox, Opera and Chrome refuse to work. I guess it is because of cross-domain-policy. (I couldn't test this with IE, because IE has to run in a virtual machine on my iMac, so for this reason it is not possible to access any local files)

Is there a setting within Firefox and the other browsers where I can tell the browser that it is ok to ajax-load files that are located on a remote server from a local html-page with a local javascript?

In a nutshell: This my html-page:

&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;meta charset=""UTF-8""&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;some title&lt;/title&gt;
        &lt;link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""../css/stylesheet.css""&gt;
        &lt;script src=""../js/jquery-2.1.3.min.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
        &lt;script src=""../js/myScript.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;!-- some content with a div-container to receive the ajax-content --&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;


This is myScript.js:

var errorMsg = function (msg) {
    //insert the message into the html-page
};

var JSONerror = function (jqXHR, textStatus, errorThrown ) {
    var msg = 'JSON-answer: '+jqXHR.responseText;
    msg += '&lt;br&gt;'+'JSON-Errorstatus: '+textStatus;
    if ($.type(errorThrown) === 'string') {
        msg += '&lt;br&gt;'+'Error: '+errorThrown;
    }
    errorMsg(msg);
};

var JSONreceive = function (JSONobj, StatusString, jqXHR) {
    //insert the data in JSONobj into the html-page
}

var StartAJAX = function () {
    $.ajax({
        url: 'http://my.domain.tld/cgi-bin/myPerlScript.pl',
        data: ""lastID="" + lastID
           + '&amp;qkz=' + Math.random(),
           dataType: ""json"",
           success: JSONreceive,
           error: JSONerror
    });
};


There is also an event-listener, that listens for page-scroll and resize and checks some other constraints (like: is there already an ajax-call in progress?). This listener calls StartAJAX.

When it calls StartAJAX on a local copy of my page (file:///User/...) within Safari, I get the Ajax-content perfectly fine inserted into my html-document. within the other browsers i get the error-message inserted into the html-page. It is:


  JSON-Answer: undefined
  JSON-Errorstatus: error
  Error:


Why does it work in Safari but not in Firefox, Chrome and Opera?  

How can I make those browsers work?

(I need to test it with all browsers, because all browsers render the same html-domument differently, but I don't want to upload all files to the server after every change just to test it.)

EDIT:

After reading some answers, I want to make something clear, that I obviously did not make clear enough:

I am searching for settings in Webbrowsers


I will NOT change the settings of my remote webserver (Apache)
I will NOT manipulate any files on my remote machine (.htaccess)
I will NOT set up a webserver on my local iMac
I will NOT change the code of the AJAX-calls in my Javascript-files
I will NOT change the code of the Perl-Scripts on my remote Server


I can tell you why:

I am just doing a short maintainance, and i am too lazy to upload every manipulated file to the remote machine after I edited it. The settings of the webserver are fine for actual operation. I don't want to change them (and maybe forget the changes before finishing my work). Same for the scripts: Those parts that some of you want to change work fine as they are now. There is no reason to touch the Ajax-Calls, because there is nothing wrong with them in the productive environment.

All I want is that those stupid browsers Firefox, Opera and Chrome behave like Safari and process the Ajax-calls correctly.

BTW:

Please can anyone explain what is so risky to call data via Ajax from an other domain in Firefox, Opera or Chrome while it seems to be harmless doing the same thing in Safari?

1268,1268,1998,How to specify which resources to protect with Spring Security OAuth2 provider configuration,"I'm currently implementing a Spring MVC application that is both an OAuth client (in the sense that it consumes data from third party service providers), and an OAuth2 Service Provider (in the sense that it should provide the means for third party oauth clients to consume data from this application from a dedicated REST api). 

While I have no issue with the implementation of the application in its capacity as OAuth client, my OAuth2 service provider configuration is interfering with the applications ability to authenticate with service providers- if I enable the Oauth2 config, it appears to intercept callbacks to the application from third party service providers. Disabling it returns the application back to its normal working state.

I'm assuming that this is because I am not specifying which urls I want to the oauth2 provider to govern exclusively- but I can't see any way of specifying this. 

To simplify the question how do I configure Spring Security OAuth2 provider to manage one url root (e.g. '/restapi/*'), and this url only, with it ignoring all other urls entirely? I've had a look at the resources at the projects homepage, but nothing is jumping out at me... 

This may well be down to how I've defined my security intercept-urls, in which case it may not be an OAuth2 specific question, but how to apply different security schemes to different url schemes. Any advice on how to do that would be great!

2378,2378,3790,Best CMS for review-type sites,"Is there an ideal CMS for making a review site? By review site, I mean like a restaurant review site where you have each entry belonging to different major categories like Cuisine and City. Then users can browse and filter by each or by combination (Chinese Food in Los Angeles, with suggestions of other Chinese restaurants in LA, etc). Furthermore, I'd want it to support other fields like price, parking, kid-friendliness, etc. And to have users be able to filter by those criteria.

I've been told that with a combination of custom taxonomies, plug-ins and many clever little queries, that Wordpress 3.x can handle this. But I'm having a heck of a time with it getting into the nitty gritty, and that's where I find the community support is lacking.

1967,1967,3133,Potential Impact of Pass/Fail vs. Letter Grade in Elective Courses,"The current grading system of my university allows graduate students to either receive a letter grade (A through F) or receive a Pass/Fail grade (where A-C is Pass) in any course offered. Each student must indicate his/her grading preference for each course within the first 2 weeks of the term. Most departments have a strict requirement that all ""required"" courses must be taken for a letter grade; however, elective courses can either be taken for a letter grade or Pass/Fail. Many of these elective courses are advanced versions of ""required"" courses, or they might be intermediate to advanced courses in other departments that are still related to one's research area.

When it comes time to apply for postdoc or junior faculty positions, could choosing to take elective courses Pass/Fail negatively impact hiring or funding decisions? For example, suppose a postdoc advertisement states that the position requires knowledge of a technique or area covered in an elective course. Would the fact that an applicant received a ""Pass"" in the course be considered the same as if the grade was instead an A or B? Alternatively, is it better to risk getting a B (or C) in a hard elective course instead of ""playing it safe"" by electing to Pass/Fail the course (where A, B, and C all get the same grade)? Are there any situations where the choice between letter grade vs. Pass/Fail can impact anything negatively or positively?

I've often heard that grades don't matter as much in graduate school compared to things like research output and networking, which may make this question a bit irrelevant. Still, I would be curious what others think.

4908,4908,7810,Seperation of drawing and logic in games,"I'm a developer that's just now starting to mess around with game development. I'm a .Net guy, so I've messed with XNA and am now playing around with Cocos2d for the iPhone. My question really is more general though. 

Let's say I'm building a simple Pong game. I'd have a Ball class and a Paddle class. Coming from the business world development, my first instinct is to not have any drawing or input handling code in either of these classes.

//pseudo code
class Ball
{
   Vector2D position;
   Vector2D velocity;
   Color color;
   void Move(){}
}


Nothing in the ball class handles input, or deals with drawing. I'd then have another class, my Game class, or my Scene.m (in Cocos2D) which would new up the Ball, and during the game loop, it would manipulate the ball as needed.

The thing is though, in many tutorials for both XNA and Cocos2D, I see a pattern like this:

//pseudo code
class Ball : SomeUpdatableComponent
{
   Vector2D position;
   Vector2D velocity;
   Color color;
   void Update(){}
   void Draw(){}
   void HandleInput(){}
}


My question is, is this right? Is this the pattern that people use in game development? It somehow goes against everything I'm used to, to have my Ball class do everything. Furthermore, in this second example, where my Ball knows how to move around, how would I handle collision detection with the Paddle? Would the Ball need to have knowledge of the Paddle? In my first example, the Game class would have references to both the Ball and the Paddle, and then ship both of those off to some CollisionDetection manager or something, but how do I deal with the complexity of various components, if each individual component does everything themselves?

  The signature on OCSP responses must follow the following rules to be
  considered valid by a Windows Vista or Windows Server 2008 client:
  
  For Windows Vista, either the OCSP signing certificate must be issued
  by the same CA as the certificate being verified or the OCSP response
  must be signed by the issuing CA. 
  
  For Windows Vista with Service Pack 1 and Windows Server 2008, the
  OCSP signing certificate may chain up to any trusted root CA as long
  as the certificate chain includes the OCSP Signing EKU extension.
  
  CryptoAPI will not support independent OCSP signer during revocation
  checking on this OCSP signing certificate chain to avoid circular
  dependency. CryptoAPI will support CRL and delegated OCSP signer only.
  
  We recommend that you enable the id-pkix-ocsp-nocheck
  (1.3.6.1.5.5.7.48.1.5) extension in the OCSP signing certificate so
  that no revocation checking is performed on the OCSP signing
  certificate. This ensures that a CRL is not downloaded to validate the

848,848,1350,Caucasus: end overland trip where I started without retracing my steps,"I'm looking into a Caucasus trip visiting Turkey, Georgia and Armenia. A return flight from IST is far cheaper than a multi-city flight, so I'd like to get back to Istanbul without going over the same route I came in (through Georgia, which as I understand seems to be the only way to get to Armenia from Turkey)

Given local neighbour relations, what path can I take that includes all three but doesn't repeat any part of the journey ?

To return from Armenia, I see two equally unreliable options: 


Getting an Azerbaijan transit visa and crossing Naxchivan, but the Armenia-Azerbaijan border is apparently closed, and I'm afraid an Armenian stamp in my passport could complicate this passage. The Armenia-Azerbaijan border is closed, so that settles this issue.
Getting an Iranian visa in Georgia then boarding the Tehran-Istanbul train. This is risky as Canadian-Iranian relations aren't super right now, I've heard of people being denied visas.

",blackbird,https://travel.stackexchange.com/users/9551,"I've done this at least twice and there's a new way now since I was last there.

Basically there were two border crossings between Turkey and Georgia, but a third one has now opened too.

The only problem is how adventurous you are. Because there is only public transport across the major cross on the Black Sea.

I've crossed from Georgia to Turkey twice from Vale to Posof. It always feels like adventure. The first time I was hitchhiking solo and the second time I was hitchhiking with two Chileans I met in Tbilisi who had never hitched before. There were no other backpackers either time. The first Turkish town is not so close and there are no buses but I always got a ride pretty quickly because Turkish people are extremely hospitable and kind to travellers. This route continues on to Kars if that interests you. I got invited home by a local family for Iftar and to stay the night. They're even more hospitable during Ramadan! (-:

Just recently I learned that the border crossing at Kartsakhi is now open too so next time I would love to try entering Turkey that way.

A return flight from IST is far cheaper than a multi-city flight, so I'd like to get back to Istanbul without going over the same route I came in (through Georgia, which as I understand seems to be the only way to get to Armenia from Turkey)

Given local neighbour relations, what path can I take that includes all three but doesn't repeat any part of the journey ?

To return from Armenia, I see two equally unreliable options: 


Getting an Azerbaijan transit visa and crossing Naxchivan, but the Armenia-Azerbaijan border is apparently closed, and I'm afraid an Armenian stamp in my passport could complicate this passage. The Armenia-Azerbaijan border is closed, so that settles this issue.
Getting an Iranian visa in Georgia then boarding the Tehran-Istanbul train. This is risky as Canadian-Iranian relations aren't super right now, I've heard of people being denied visas.

","I've done this at least twice and there's a new way now since I was last there.

Basically there were two border crossings between Turkey and Georgia, but a third one has now opened too.

The only problem is how adventurous you are. Because there is only public transport across the major cross on the Black Sea.

I've crossed from Georgia to Turkey twice from Vale to Posof. It always feels like adventure. The first time I was hitchhiking solo and the second time I was hitchhiking with two Chileans I met in Tbilisi who had never hitched before. There were no other backpackers either time. The first Turkish town is not so close and there are no buses but I always got a ride pretty quickly because Turkish people are extremely hospitable and kind to travellers. This route continues on to Kars if that interests you. I got invited home by a local family for Iftar and to stay the night. They're even more hospitable during Ramadan! (-:

Just recently I learned that the border crossing at Kartsakhi is now open too so next time I would love to try entering Turkey that way.

Why would you catch (DocumentException e) and then throw a new instance that strips out all useful information? You can simply not catch it in the first place and let it percolate up to someone who can handle it.

Also, use Java 7 try-with-resources rather than finally. So, you code should be:

public static String readFile(String xmlFileName) throws IOException, DocumentException {
    try (final InputStream is = new ClassPathResource(xmlFileName).getInputStream()) {
        final SAXReader reader = new SAXReader();

    }

1189,1189,1869,"Diff between backups: see permissions, group and owner and sym link differences","Question

Using only the command line, is it possible to tell if a rsync backup (on a NAS) and the original folder tree (on a web server) are exactly the same? I mean in terms of file sizes, attributes, and symbolic links?

I feat the most for symbolic links. In case of a hard-drive failure – let's say I can solve all the booting issues – will I be able to put back all the files with all the symbolic links done right and their permissions / attributes?

Context
I am setting up an rsync backup system in which my NAS (arm processor) connects to my dedicated webserver hosted far far away and does a backup of the / partition. 

In case of a disk crash, I plan on making the exact same partition setup on the new disk, on installing the same operating system (14.04) so I get the MBR / boot loader in place. 

Then I will rsync back the backup from the NAS to the server, reboot and cross my fingers.

The issue is that I will only know if everything works the day I need the backup…. But I can take measures to know if it will work before. One of them is checking that every single file, folder, sym link… in the backup has the same permissions, attributes, whatever than the original. I also need to check that the sym links and similar are correctly done.

The options I use with rsync are :

rsync -rlptgoDXvxzH --numeric-ids --exclude={""/dev/*"",""/proc/*"",""/sys/*"",""/tmp/*"",""/run/*"",""/mnt/*"",""/media/*"",""/lost+found""}


The option A is causing issues.

EDIT: ADDITIONAL INFO

What I am looking for is a working backup strategy that will allow me:

– to perform blazing fast backups.
Because I do backup the / system partition, I take most services down on the server (apache, postfix, dovecot, mysql, etc.) so I can have a safe backup. Any solution such as rsync is good, because I can update a mirror directory on the NAS. Then, offline, I can take care of the backup strategy (incremental, etc…) from the updated mirror.

– to have fast restore (I don't want to transfer a 100 GB disk image).
I have a really really fast connection between the NAS and the server. I mean really fast. Transferring a 10 GB disk image is a matter of minutes.

What I can't do: change the physical setup of the hosted server. I have one 500 GB disk. That's all.

What I can do: boot the server in a rescue mode in which the disk isn't mounted at all. Rescue mode even works with a dead disk. I use this mode to perform binary images of partitions.

Current setup: 
/     10 GB, 17 % full
SWAP 512 Mo
/var  80 GB
/bkup the rest… to 500 GB.
",Adeline,https://askubuntu.com/users/271981,"What you're really asking is: What is a good Backup Strategy for my server and that depends what you want to do when the lightning hits your server...

For me, speedy restore is what I want, so what I do is:

I have one additional small, old, cheap disk containing 2 additional partitions on the server: a 500GB ext4 partition containing the system back-ups and a  500MB FAT32 boot, diag partition (yep, MegaByte, and it's a bit too big!) containing CloneZilla.

Whenever I'm going to do some drastic changes to the server or whenever I feel I can afford a 5 minute down-time, I boot the server into the FAT32 CloneZilla partition, which then backs up my root partition excluding ""/home"" in 5 minutes! (using disk-to-image)

I've had to restore the image only once and it works like a charm: server was set back 1 month (as I wasn't sure when I introduced the problem), installed all its updates and then I had to redo my work from the last month which was basically installing a few utilities.

Using only the command line, is it possible to tell if a rsync backup (on a NAS) and the original folder tree (on a web server) are exactly the same? I mean in terms of file sizes, attributes, and symbolic links?

I feat the most for symbolic links. In case of a hard-drive failure – let's say I can solve all the booting issues – will I be able to put back all the files with all the symbolic links done right and their permissions / attributes?

Context
I am setting up an rsync backup system in which my NAS (arm processor) connects to my dedicated webserver hosted far far away and does a backup of the / partition. 

In case of a disk crash, I plan on making the exact same partition setup on the new disk, on installing the same operating system (14.04) so I get the MBR / boot loader in place. 

Then I will rsync back the backup from the NAS to the server, reboot and cross my fingers.

The issue is that I will only know if everything works the day I need the backup…. But I can take measures to know if it will work before. One of them is checking that every single file, folder, sym link… in the backup has the same permissions, attributes, whatever than the original. I also need to check that the sym links and similar are correctly done.

The options I use with rsync are :

rsync -rlptgoDXvxzH --numeric-ids --exclude={""/dev/*"",""/proc/*"",""/sys/*"",""/tmp/*"",""/run/*"",""/mnt/*"",""/media/*"",""/lost+found""}


The option A is causing issues.

EDIT: ADDITIONAL INFO

What I am looking for is a working backup strategy that will allow me:

– to perform blazing fast backups.
Because I do backup the / system partition, I take most services down on the server (apache, postfix, dovecot, mysql, etc.) so I can have a safe backup. Any solution such as rsync is good, because I can update a mirror directory on the NAS. Then, offline, I can take care of the backup strategy (incremental, etc…) from the updated mirror.

– to have fast restore (I don't want to transfer a 100 GB disk image).
I have a really really fast connection between the NAS and the server. I mean really fast. Transferring a 10 GB disk image is a matter of minutes.

What I can't do: change the physical setup of the hosted server. I have one 500 GB disk. That's all.

What I can do: boot the server in a rescue mode in which the disk isn't mounted at all. Rescue mode even works with a dead disk. I use this mode to perform binary images of partitions.

Current setup: 
/     10 GB, 17 % full
SWAP 512 Mo
/var  80 GB
/bkup the rest… to 500 GB.
","What you're really asking is: What is a good Backup Strategy for my server and that depends what you want to do when the lightning hits your server...

For me, speedy restore is what I want, so what I do is:

I have one additional small, old, cheap disk containing 2 additional partitions on the server: a 500GB ext4 partition containing the system back-ups and a  500MB FAT32 boot, diag partition (yep, MegaByte, and it's a bit too big!) containing CloneZilla.

Whenever I'm going to do some drastic changes to the server or whenever I feel I can afford a 5 minute down-time, I boot the server into the FAT32 CloneZilla partition, which then backs up my root partition excluding ""/home"" in 5 minutes! (using disk-to-image)

I've had to restore the image only once and it works like a charm: server was set back 1 month (as I wasn't sure when I introduced the problem), installed all its updates and then I had to redo my work from the last month which was basically installing a few utilities.

In addition to that, I rsync my /home and the system image backup partition weekly at Monday 03:00 am (which is when the server has its lowest usage).

If that's good enough for you, use the same strategy.

","Changing the database through the ""back door"" is in contradiction to using a orm especially with a cache.

I would try to avoid this situation completely (although I know that you have needs for it).

A solution using the back door cold be:


Send a notification to the application using hibernate.
This Notification leads to an eviction of the cache (Probably the notification can contain infromation about the part of the cache to be evicted).

How can I effectively counter a support Zyra?
",Schism,https://gaming.stackexchange.com/users/31508,"There seems to be a lot of misleading information in the other answers here.  I play Zyra as support at Diamond 1.  The thing with Zyra is that she is more of a high risk/high reward support.  She can beat anyone, but strong engages is the best chance you have at beating her.  The best counters to Zyra are champions that can force hard engages on her and holder her stunned/cced for a long amount of time.  Short list of these would be (Leona, Thresh, Blitzcrank)

As a hard engage champion, you have 2 ways to force a fight.

1) Bait out her E so that she cannot root you as you try to run up to her.

2) Dodge her E or get close enough that even if you get hit by it you still can lock her down.

You need to then focus her down because she will often be much more squishy than the adc.  Also a little known fact is that at level 3 onward, she does far more damage than the adc in these fights also.  For this reason you need to try to kill her before she can unload on your adc.  As a tanky support you can often live through her damage and her adcs combined (use all defensive quints/marks in addition to your normal defensive glyphs/seals and 0/9/21 or 0/21/9 masteries).

Even if you counter Zyra with these hard engages, if she gets too far ahead she will easily kill you and your adc over and over again.  You need to get ahead before level 6 because it increases her burst substantially.

Alternatively, Vel'Koz actually can do great vs her.  He has a much longer poke and also can stun.  (Lux doesn't work as well because if they try to hard engage on you, the snare doesn't do much to stop them from getting their combo off)  Never engage this fight and focus on poking safely until you force her back or she does a sloppy engage if she gets desperate.

Why don't a lot of the other answers work?

Janna:  Other's stated that you can simply shield your adc every time Zyra tries to damage them.  Unfortionately, Zyra's abilities do FAR more damage than Janna can shield for.  Zyra's poke can be used to easily zone your ADC out of lane if you are a support Janna since you have no way to counter her damage and engage on her.

Taric:  Sure he has a targeted stun, but it moves extremely slowly.  This gives her plenty of time to react to the stun with a root + seed before it hits her and so the only thing taric gets off is a stun.  He can't follow up to finish Zyra off and if Zyra ignored taric and managed to get a burst off on the adc, the adc will quickly die from the damage zyra just output with her abilities/plants combined with her own adcs damage.

Soraka:  Her heal has such a high CD she can't heal the damage Zyra does before she can get another round of her abilities off.  Also, she can safely get her abilities off before she can get silenced by soraka.  Soraka will never be able to be in range for her Q to do damage until the fight is over.

Sona:  She just gets destroyed by Zyra.  Shorter ranged poke, not enough sustain to sustain past Zyra's damage.

There are a bunch of posts on the internet on SQL performance counters such as this one, but I am really interested in just the few that are related to network/disk usage and any latency or limits that associated with disk reads/writes.  What are some of the important SQL or Windows performance counters that I should look at to create a current baseline/comparison for iSCSI disk access for SQL?

When analyzing disk performance issues I would look into this counters. 

Avg. Disk sec/Read - is the average time, in seconds, of a read of data from the disk.

4670,4670,7399,Get latitude/longitude of friend's current_location using Graph FQL,"I'm trying to get the latitude/longitude of all of a user's friends using a single API call. I believe I need to write a multi-query FQL statement, but I can't get the syntax correct.

I believe the two queries need to be something like the following:

'""friends"":""SELECT uid,current_location FROM user WHERE uid IN (SELECT uid2 FROM friend WHERE uid1 = me())""'

'""location"":""SELECT location FROM page WHERE id IN (SELECT current_location_id FROM #friends)""';


My problem is that somehow I need to get the ID of the current_location in the first query so that I can reference it in the second query, but I only know how to get an array that contains the id.

Thanks for any help!

Clarification:

I'm not trying to get check-ins of friends.  Instead I want to graph the ""current_location"" (i.e. where they live) of all of a user's friends on a Geo map.  I can get a user's ""current_location"" with the following FQL query:

""SELECT uid,sex,current_location FROM user WHERE uid IN (SELECT uid2 FROM friend WHERE uid1 = me())""


This query returns the following array:

[current_location] =&gt; Array
            (
                [city] =&gt; New York
                [state] =&gt; New York
                [country] =&gt; United States
                [zip] =&gt; 
                [id] =&gt; 108424279189115
                [name] =&gt; New York, New York
            )


Which does not contain the longitude and latitude of the of the current_location (New York in the above example)

Therefore I now need to take the ID of the current_location (e.g. 108424279189115) and run a second FQL query such as:

""SELECT location,name FROM page WHERE page_id = 108424279189115)""


To get the latitude and longitude of the current_location.  Currently, I have a working code that runs the first FQL query, then extracts page_id in php, and then runs a second FQL query to get the current_location latitude/longitude.  However, for performance reasons I would like to run only one multi-query if this is possible.
",pyro70,https://stackoverflow.com/users/783423,"Edit:

The query should work by adjusting the second query to:

'""location"":""SELECT location FROM page WHERE id IN (SELECT current_location.id FROM #friends)""';


When working with an array type in the FB API you can access the value in any query by doing array.value

Also, if all you need is the page's id, you'll probably get better performance by doing current_location.id in your first query



You're going to want to use a fql.multiquery, there is a similair answer here that can be tailored to your needs: Facebook Graph API get all users and their status

The FQL documentation on multiquery is located here: http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/fql/

Also are you trying to get the lat/long of a checkin object? If so you need to take a look at this resource: http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/fql/checkin/

Edit:

I'm not sure that what you are trying to do is possible. I just looked through the api and tested some queries, the only way you could get the lat/long from a friend seems to be based on a checkin, from there you can get details on the page if necessary... Even looking at your second query, current_location_id is not referenced anywhere in the page table, and selecting location from the page table is going to give you location info on the place that it pertains to. Maybe you could elaborate more on what you're trying to accomplish.

Here is a multiquery statement I wrote in PHP using FQL (it will select the coordinates of all your friends check ins, then from there get details on the place of the checkin pertaining to that friend):

try{
    $multiQuery = ""{
        'query1':'SELECT coords, tagged_uids, page_id FROM checkin WHERE author_uid IN (SELECT uid2 FROM friend WHERE uid1 = me())',
        'query2':'SELECT name, description FROM page WHERE page_id IN (SELECT page_id FROM #query1)'
    }"";

    $param = array(       
         'method' =&gt; 'fql.multiquery',       
         'queries' =&gt; $multiQuery,       
         'callback' =&gt; ''
    );       
    $queryresults = $facebook-&gt;api($param);

3526,3526,5620,A helical cycloid?,"While combing around my notes looking for other possible examples for this question, I chanced upon another one of my unsolved problems:

Cycloidal curves are curves generated by a circle rolling upon a plane or space curve. It's not too hard to derive the required parametric equations if the fixed curve is a plane curve, but I've had some trouble deriving the corresponding expression for space curves.

More specifically, here is the particular problem I was concerned with: consider a (cylindrical) helix:

$$\begin{align*}x&amp;=a\cos\;t\\y&amp;=a\sin\;t\\z&amp;=ct\end{align*}$$

and imagine a circle of radius $r$ whose plane is always perpendicular to the x-y plane rolling on the helix, starting at the point $(a,0,0)$ ($t=0$). Imagine a point in the plane of the circle at a distance $hr$ from the center. What are the parametric equations for the locus of the point?

The two obvious pieces of information I have are that the center of the circle also traces a helix, whose parametric equation differs from the original by a vertical shift of $r$ (per Tony, that was an erroneous assumption), and that the expression for the arclength of the helix, $s=\sqrt{a^2+c^2}t$, should figure into the final parametric equations. Otherwise, I'm not sure how to start.

How does one derive parametric equations for the ""helical cycloid""?



The physical model I had in mind was a screw ramp winding around a cylinder. Supposing that there was a car that needed to go to the top of the cylinder by driving on the ramp, and supposing that a spot is placed on one of the car's wheels, what are the equations for the locus of the spot?
",J. M. is not a mathematician,https://math.stackexchange.com/users/498,"The tangent to the helix at $P = (a \cos t, a \sin t, ct)$ is

The vector  

$H = (\cos t, \sin t, 0)$   

is horizontal, and perpendicular to $T$. The radius vector $R$ from $P$ to the centre $C$ of the circle is perpendicular to both of these, so it is proportional to

If I read that right, your server variable is actually pointing to a class, like so:

Class server = [Server class];
...
NSLog(@""begin"");
[server startServer];
NSLog(@""end"");


If that is the case, then your startServer method would have to be a class method:

+ (void)startServer {
    NSLog(@""hello!"");

  FYI -(void)startServer is in another class called ""Server"" and I have made ""server"" a pointer to that said class.


If I read that right, your server variable is actually pointing to a class, like so:

Class server = [Server class];
...
NSLog(@""begin"");
[server startServer];
NSLog(@""end"");


If that is the case, then your startServer method would have to be a class method:

4965,4965,7909,Seperation of drawing and logic in games,"I'm a developer that's just now starting to mess around with game development. I'm a .Net guy, so I've messed with XNA and am now playing around with Cocos2d for the iPhone. My question really is more general though. 

Let's say I'm building a simple Pong game. I'd have a Ball class and a Paddle class. Coming from the business world development, my first instinct is to not have any drawing or input handling code in either of these classes.

//pseudo code
class Ball
{
   Vector2D position;
   Vector2D velocity;
   Color color;
   void Move(){}
}


Nothing in the ball class handles input, or deals with drawing. I'd then have another class, my Game class, or my Scene.m (in Cocos2D) which would new up the Ball, and during the game loop, it would manipulate the ball as needed.

The thing is though, in many tutorials for both XNA and Cocos2D, I see a pattern like this:

//pseudo code
class Ball : SomeUpdatableComponent
{
   Vector2D position;
   Vector2D velocity;
   Color color;
   void Update(){}
   void Draw(){}
   void HandleInput(){}
}


My question is, is this right? Is this the pattern that people use in game development? It somehow goes against everything I'm used to, to have my Ball class do everything. Furthermore, in this second example, where my Ball knows how to move around, how would I handle collision detection with the Paddle? Would the Ball need to have knowledge of the Paddle? In my first example, the Game class would have references to both the Ball and the Paddle, and then ship both of those off to some CollisionDetection manager or something, but how do I deal with the complexity of various components, if each individual component does everything themselves? (I hope I'm making sense.....)
",BFree,https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/users/4911,"I think what you're probably use to in the business world is separating abstraction and implementation.

Furthermore, in this second example, where my Ball knows how to move around, how would I handle collision detection with the Paddle? Would the Ball need to have knowledge of the Paddle? In my first example, the Game class would have references to both the Ball and the Paddle, and then ship both of those off to some CollisionDetection manager or something, but how do I deal with the complexity of various components, if each individual component does everything themselves? (I hope I'm making sense.....)
","I think what you're probably use to in the business world is separating abstraction and implementation. 

In the game dev world, you usually want to think in terms of speed. The more objects you have the more context switches will occur which may slow things down depending on the current load.

This is only my speculation since I'm a wannabe game developer but a professonial developer.

1279,1279,2015,DIY Floating Desk in New Build Home,"Evening all,

It's my first time posting so be gentle, I've been reading a fair few of your posts and hope you can answer my question.



I've attached a picture of where I would like to build a ""floating"" desk. the width is approximately 217cm, and I'd ideally like it to be 70cm to 80cm deep.

The white lines are my rough idea for the frame, and the red indicates a radiator.

The wall on the right is a stud wall, and I have no idea what the other 2 are. The back one is clearly exterior and the other is a joining wall with another house.

I'm basing it on the design used here: http://overthebigmoon.com/diy-file-cabinet-desk-blendtec-giveaway/

I could possibly use supports similar to those if absolutely necessary.

My question is really about support. Will the desk bow in any way? Is it too wide? Will the frame suggested be sufficient? Does any one have any other thoughts? How will I attach it to the walls?

Thanks,
Ashley
",Ash Toolio,https://diy.stackexchange.com/users/37957,"I guess nobody else is going to take a swipe at answering this, so I'll give it a shot.

Will the desk bow in any way?

Depends on load and construction details. With the items pictured, even a pretty lightly constructed one will probably not bow/bend/sag much, and there are ways to frame it so that a much heavier load could be supported. What you need to do depends on what you anticipate possibly happening to the desk - if people might sit on it, it needs a good deal more support than if it's just holding a modern lightweight computer and sundries. But if you might set a box of papaer or books on it, then it needs more again...

Is it too wide?

No, subject to adequate framing.

Will the frame suggested be sufficient?

Color me dubious on that front. While it's sufficient for the purposes it was built for (evidently) it's more fully supported than what you are proposing to do, which allows it to be not so robust - but again, this is also load dependent, though having the desk break IF someone sits on it (even if you don't intend it to be used that way) can be somewhat annoying.

Does any one have any other thoughts? 

Stressed skin panel construction offers some interesting possibilities, depending what you are up for, and what you are looking for.

How will I attach it to the walls?

Multiple options. Ledger boards on each end are a good approach if you don't mind them being visible. File cabinets and no wall attachment as with the linked plans are another approach, but evidently not what you want. Huge shelf brackets as you mentioned in a comment are another option. Much of this comes down to YOUR concept of a ""floating"" desk or how important it is that the desk slab appears to be sitting there with ""no visible means of support"" and whether that means ""nothing visible when standing 6 feet away"" or ""nothing visible when lying on the floor.""

In the ""can be effectively invisible"" line, you attach angle iron to the side walls, build a thick-ish (you can thin the front edge) slab, cut slits in the ends that slide over the angle irons and slide it in place. That calls for some precision crafting. The slab needs to be thick-ish both so that you can have a non-contributing part below the angle iron to conceal it, and so it's stiff enough to span 2 meters while only being supported at the extreme ends.

Less drastically austere solutions allow for a cross-beam below the desk surface but beyond/above where your knees would hit it, and visible supports on the end walls that the desk slab sets on top of. 

The giant shelf bracket approach is arguably ""not really floating"" but does have no ""feet"" or ""legs"" down to the floor.

All will hold the desk slab up. Different ones require more or less structure from the desk slab itself, due to greater or lesser spacing between support elements.

What I am trying to do is remove a template part from my home page after the user clicks on the pagination links from the posts, right now my template part serves as a ""hero"" or ""featured"" area, and I would like it to go away when the user looks at older posts, eg the pagination, here is what I am doing so far and it is not working, thanks!

&lt;?php if( is_home() || is_front_page() ) : ?&gt;

as you can see i created a blank template , not sure if this was necessary , does it need to be inside the loop? thank you!
","I believe what you need is is_page().

if (is_paged()) {
  // page 2 or later of an archive
} else {
  // only the first page of an archive
}


With your code, I think but am not 100% sure, that you want:

if( !is_paged() &amp;&amp; ( is_home() || is_front_page() ) ) :
 get_template_part( 'hero' );
else :
 get_template_part( 'blank' );
endif;

3379,3379,5388,"Good travel games for two players, especially for playing on trains?","I would be interested to hear if anyone had recommendations for 2-player games that are particularly suitable for playing while travelling on trains.  (I ask this as someone who mostly enjoys games like Carcassonne, Power Grid, Agricola, Pandemic, etc. around the table at home.)  To be specific, the things that I think are important properties for these games are:


Needing minimal table space.  Most trains have a small table you could use, but not much more.
Being quiet to play, so that other passengers won't be disturbed.  For example, I imagine that games that involve repeatedly rolling dice wouldn't be appreciated.
Packing down small, so that they don't take up much luggage space.
Not requiring batteries or a power socket.  (I appreciate that an iPhone or a Nintendo DS for each player might be a good solution more generally, but it's not what I'm after in this case.)
Not being so delicate to arrange that motion from the train will unduly disrupt the play.


I think it would be best to recommend one game (or class of games) per answer, if that's appropriate, and explain why you think it's particularly suitable.  (Incidentally, I've read the guidance on good questions about game recommendations and hope this question meets the criteria.)

Update: Thanks for so many excellent suggestions - we certainly won't be short of games for our next long train journey :)

Update 2: Unfortunately, I can't really playtest this many great games in any reasonable time period, so I'm going to accept the top-voted answer (Cribbage) and try out the others as soon as I can.  Thanks again...

",MOON,https://travel.stackexchange.com/users/15207,"There are seven countries which have territorial claims on parts of Antarctica: Britain, France, Australia, New Zealand, and Norway, which all recognize each other's claims; and Chile and Argentina, whose claims are disputed.

In practice, however, all claims are suspended under international treaty, and there are no checkpoints or immigration officers. For most people, a visit to Antarctica consists of a flight over it or a ride on a ship through its waters, neither involving disembarkation and thus both avoiding immigration formalities.

Land tourism does exist, and a permit is required. The vast majority of visitors will arrive by commercial ship or helicopter, and the tour operator is responsible for obtaining the necessary permits. You may, of course, need a visa for the country where your tour is departing from.

To land on the continent in a private vessel such as a yacht, you would need to obtain a permit yourself from your own government, if your country is a signatory to the Antarctic Treaty System. For example, Britons would apply to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Polar Regions Department; Americans would file the DS-4131 Advance Notification Form – Tourist and Other Non-Governmental Activities in the Antarctic Treaty Area with the Department of State’s Office of Ocean and Polar Affairs

Due to Antartica's extreme physical conditions and remoteness, only a few dozen yachts make the trip each year, and there are special yachting guidelines for Antarctic cruises.

So, what does this mean? The terminator cannot destroy himself unless it is absolutely necessary in order to succeed in his mission (like protect John?)?

In that case, what was the Terminator in part 1 going to do after the success of his mission (i.e. destroy Sarah)? Just live a long happy life and wait for Skynet arise?

Update:
I understand that this is not the exact Third law of Asimov, since the terminators definitely don't follow the First or Second law. Let's call it the law of self-preservation. Does terminator have a form of self-preservation to some point and the prohibition of suicide?
",SPIRiT_1984,https://scifi.stackexchange.com/users/4435,"Disclaimer:  For the sake of building a rational explanation, I am going to assume that skynet does not have any knowledge of the three laws.  That assumption is based on the obvious fact that they do harm humans, and allow humans to come to harm by any means necessary.

I do believe that a T800 as designed by SkyNet is fully capable of self termination.  For example, if one were facing capture by the resistance, it would be beneficial to SkyNet for the terminator to destroy itself, thus rendering the technology useless to the enemy.  Plasma weapons would be effective in rendering any computational hardware unrecoverable, while the endoskeleton is less of a concern in 2018-2027.

So why would a Terminator capable of self termination be unable to self-terminate when sent back in time?  Ignoring the fact that plasma rifles are in short supply in the 1990's, prior to being sent back, John Connor instructed the Terminator with its mission parameters one of which could have been to have John or Sarah destroy the Terminator in a way that would not leave any recoverable technology behind.

A Terminator can only self terminate itself to the point it stops functioning, but technology can still be recovered.  Recovering this technology in the present is what allows SkyNet to be developed.  Self-termination would not completely satisfy the requirements set forth by the parameter, and thus the Terminator cannot comply.  The only other alternative would be for someone to continue to reduce the machine into harmless metal.  It's convenient, however, that the movie ends in a metal foundry. 

I know someone is going to ask ""Why not jump into the molten metal, then?""  I like to believe that John would have wanted his younger self to learn a lesson of loss, and having to face a tough decision.  Old John knows his mother is going to die soon, and losing the Terminator will help him do a practice run through the grieving process. He might also want to have himself develop an animosity toward the machines as he gets older...hating them for forcing him to destroy the machine he grew to love.  We can see some of this resentment in T3, when he has an attitude with the Terminator.  This could be some of the fuel for the fire inside John Connor of the future...

To that end I would like to maximize my soldiers' will by reloading at the end of the mission until I'm satisfied with the result. How much will can an operative gain per rank? What's the maximum will a soldier can have at each rank up?

Bonus questions: how likely is a soldier to get the maximum will increase when ranking up? What about high rank soldiers that come as mission rewards?
",kotekzot,https://gaming.stackexchange.com/users/19827,"All rookie soldiers start with 40 Will and gain Will increases as they gain ranks.  They suffer a decrease in Will when they suffer a critical wound in battle.  Therefore, there isn't really a single low number to worry about, as it varies by each rank.  Also, a Squaddie (or any other low ranked soldier) who has been critically wounded can eventually gain enough Will back to be a successful soldier.

The table below shows the low and high Will values a soldier can have, by rank.  By checking each soldier against the table, you can determine if their will is too low for the rank they have.  I've included the low and high Will values for when the Iron Will upgrade has been purchased.  However, I'm not certain how helpful those will be, as you generally purchase that upgrade after your soldiers have been promoted a few times, so you won't expect to see values as high as the columns indicate.

I created the table using the following assumptions:


Each soldier gets a fixed +2 per level.
Each soldier gets a random +1d6 per level (iRandWillIncrease=6 in the ini file).
Each soldier gets another fixed +2 per level when the Iron Will upgrade is purchased (iBaseOTSWillIncrease=2 in the ini file).
Each soldier gets another random +1d4 per level when the Iron Will upgrade is purchased (iRandOTSWillIncrease=4 in the ini file).

Will increases stay the same.  Hidden Potential changes the Will increases (and all other stat increases) to be random, so there will be a much larger variation of Will values among your soldiers.

407,407,633,Battery Drains Every 1-3 Weeks,"I have been experiencing a slow draining of the battery for the past 1-2 months wherein the vehicle will be fine and suddenly the vehicle will not start.  

First thought was the battery, as the vehicle has about 90000 on it.  I could have tested it, but didn't; just bought another one thinking it would save the trouble soon enough if it wasn't the battery.  On installing the battery, I checked for the usual: lights left on, doors left open, etc.  But there was nothing out of the ordinary.

Two weeks later, the new battery drained. I charged up the old one swapped it in.  One week later, that one was drained.  

Determined now that it was not the battery, I searched high and low for some good tests.  I did a ground test (all less than 2-1ohm), point to point resistance check(all 1-2ohm), parasitic draw test (30mA after entering sleep mode), and charging voltage test.  Everything looked satisfactory.  The only thing that I noticed was, if I left the nominal voltage charging test run, for minutes, I would slowly watch the voltage creep down.  After twenty minutes I was seeing 13.8V after starting at 14.3V (measured across the battery terminals).  I ran out of time to swap out the battery on my multimeter (thinking this might be the culprit), so it could just be that.  But, I'm curious.  Does a slow fall of the charging voltage (across the battery terminals) indicate an alternator problem?  Belt tensioner problem?  Looking for thoughts on this slow decline in charging voltage across the battery to determine where to dig into next.  I didn't see how low it could go, but if the community thinks it's worth a shot, I'll do it (even if it means an hour to find it).

Any help will be appreciated. Big thanks in advance...:) 
","You have not specify any programming language, but still try these steps whatever language you are going to use:


Generate a random number from 1 to 12
Generate second random number and check if it is same like first or not, if not than go ahead for third number and check it with first and second.
Repeat this process for all four digits

Unless you are scoring a place at a stand-out-in-bold-on-your-resume company (like Google/Facebook) is it worth doing unpaid internship in a software house?

",Rory,https://programmers.stackexchange.com/users/48536,"First off: I am a mathematician - a professional one (in that I get paid for doing maths).  I am not a programmer.  I do do some programming, but very definitely of the Cargo Cult variety (see first comment to http://tex.stackexchange.com/q/451/86 and my response) and nothing of the sort that would normally bring me to this site (indeed, I registered here to post this answer after seeing a link to it in the TeX chat room).

The summary of my answer is: Mathematics is Programming.

I recently got to teach a mathematics course to a non-mathematical group of students.  They were the programming section.  I thought this was fantastic!  At last, I was going to be able to teach mathematics to people who already understood the basic ideas and who already had a rudimentary toolkit for doing maths.  I was incredibly disappointed when I asked how many of them had actually written a program and got an answer somewhere between 0 and 1.

Before I go on, I should clarify a few things.  There are areas of mathematics that concern themselves directly with programming and are to do with evaluating algorithms and classifying languages and such-like.  I'm not talking about those.  There is also a program which is trying to translate all of mathematics into a formal language that can be evaluated by a computer.  This is a bit closer to what I'm talking about, but even so to focus on that would miss the main part of what I'm trying to say.  The mathematics that I do and the programming that I do are almost completely unrelated by topic.  The connection between them is on a different level.

Where I'd like to start is with the comment on the main question:


  If that is doing math, then all human activity is a form of math. If that's the case then the word math doesn't have a useful meaning, because it can't be used to distinguish one activity from another.


Yes, that is doing maths.  But ""maths"" is still a useful word because, as the song says, ""It ain't what you do, it's the way that you do it."".  I would say that I am doing maths when I am approaching something in a mathematical way.  Sometimes, that is ""hard core"" mathematics: formulating definitions, proving theorems.  Sometimes, it isn't.  Sometimes, it's writing silly little programs so that my kids can learn their spelling words.

This is what mathematics helps me with when I program:


Abstraction This is probably the most important transferable skill from mathematics.  By this, I mean the ability to strip away all the unnecessary stuff and focus on the important properties.
Perspective If I could only choose one thing that all my students were to learn, this would be it: The ability to change ones point of view to suit the problem.  We commonly treat this in linear algebra with change-of-basis formulae (that lead to horrendous matrices and horrendous complications), but it is much more applicable than that.  At heart, it is the idea that just because something has been presented to you in one fashion, that doesn't have to be the way you work with it.  This separates ones view of the thing itself from the way it has been presented.  This can be extremely practical: it is all about making something useful or efficient.  If I have a list of vectors and it is more efficient to store them as a list of x-coordinates and a list of y-coordinates, so be it.
Form versus Function Leading on from the above; if a thing can be presented in many different ways then it is no longer fair to say that one particular presentation is the thing.  To misquote that song again: ""It ain't what you are it's what you do"" that matters.


I could go on, but those are the ones that spring to mind.

Now, there are probably lots of (negative) reactions to what I've written so far.  One will be ""That's not maths, that's just good sense."" (or bad sense) to which I refer to my remark above agreeing with the sentiment that ""all human activity is a form of math"".  Another will be ""That isn't the type of maths meant in the question."".  This is almost certainly true and here I actually have a lot more sympathy with the person who said ""At least I haven't touched the maths for 10 years,"".  He or she is wrong, of course, they have been doing maths for 10 years because whenever they wrote a program they were doing maths.  They just didn't realise it.  And here we get to the point about why I was delighted with the (sadly unrealised) possibility of teaching mathematics to students who were already programmers.

I do actually use some ""real maths"" in my programs.  I recently coded a fun 3D shape explorer which involved using some maths to figure out the projections and other transformations that I had to apply to my data.  I was mildly amused to find myself actually coding quaternions!  But of course, the maths that was involved was trivial compared to the maths that I do when I'm working.  It was ""back of envelope"" stuff.  That type of maths, then I agree with the sentiment that you pick it up when you need it, and if you need something more complicated than you can find on Wikipedia then you find a real mathematician to do it for you.  However, in order that you can pick it up when you need it then you need to have learnt something.  That thing might not be anything you ever actually use, but having learnt that something makes it all the easier to pick up what you do actually use later in life.  So this is where I disagree with Coder: you do need to learn some mathematics if you are ever going to use any mathematics and you need to learn it from the mathematical side (which doesn't mean proving theorems, by the way).

And so finally to the ""Mathematics is Programming"".  You can learn all of these things from being a good programmer.  And if you've learnt these things, you will find mathematics much easier because you will understand that when we talk about a vector in a vector space then it's just an instance of the class Vector which means that we can do all the things that Vector does to that instance: add, subtract, scale, and so forth.  That's why I would love to teach mathematics to programmers.  But, speaking as a mathematician, I would say that the first of these, ""Abstraction"", is easier to learn in mathematics than in programming because mathematics is the pursuit of abstraction.  Whenever we see some behaviour our training is always to ask ""What is it about that thing that makes it behave in that way?  What if I took another thing that was similar, would it behave in the same way?  How much of what that thing is would I have to lose for it to stop behaving like that?""  (Taking this to the extreme leads to ""centipede mathematics"" - search for the term).  But we don't do this with (just) ""real world"" objects (whatever they are), we do this with things that have already been abstracted.

This has gone on long enough, so let me close with one of the classic mathematician jokes:


  A mathematician and a physicist both attended a seminar on some new model involving 24 dimensional space.  Afterwards, they were discussing it and the physicist remarked: ""That was really hard.  I mean, how does one visualise 24-dimensional space?"" to which the mathematician replied: ""Oh, it's easy.  Just visualise n-dimensional space and then set n = 24."".




Added 2012-03-2

There were quite a few comments on this answer expressing a variety of views.  These have now been deleted by a moderator on the understanding that I would try to take into incorporate them (or respond to them) in my answer.

However, I'm not sure that I can.  Reading those comments and the rest of what's on this page, I can only come to the conclusion that there is a huge misunderstanding as to what mathematics actually is.  Moreover, I don't feel competent enough to explain it.  Fortunately, someone has already linked to Lockhart's Lament so I'll defer the explanation to that.  Whilst I might have put it differently (as I grew up in a scientific environment, I would have put more emphasis on the experimental nature of mathematics), I don't think I could put it better.

I do still think I can add something.  As well as the misunderstandings as to what mathematics is, there are also misunderstandings as to what ""doing mathematics"" means.  I see two almost contradictory stances:


Mathematics is about equations and formulas.  So there's no need to study it because Wikipedia exists (this is almost the converse of Euler's apocryphal challenge to Diderot).
Mathematics is about theorems and definitions.  So there's no need to study it as programs never prove anything (which is about as complete a fallacy as ... insert favourite fallacy here).


Whilst the two stances contradict each other, they end up in the same place: there's no point in a programmer learning any mathematics - and most assuredly not from a mathematician!  After all, what do they know about anything?  Anything that a programmer really needs to know can be found in Wikipedia, or cribbed off someone else.

Above, I described myself as a Cargo Cult Programmer.  I bet most of you had a private giggle to yourself and thought, ""Ah yes, I bet I know what your programs look like then."".  You probably felt a bit smug and superior (though I'm sure you felt bad about feeling smug and superior).

What I've described just above is Cargo Cult Mathematics.

So when I say that you should learn a bit of mathematics to understand how mathematics works, I'm saying it for exactly the same reason as you might if you saw a bit of code that I'd written: ""How much easier your life would be if you'd stop cut-and-pasting code from StackOverflow and learnt just a bit about how to do it properly."".

The most important thing, though, is that you should learn it from mathematicians.  Why so?  Here's an analogy.  The language that I'm most adept at is TeX.  (Says it all, really!).  Now, suppose I want to learn a bit more about TeX and it just so happens that Don Knuth is in town and has offered to give some tutorials on TeX.  Or I could just read about it on Wikipedia.  Or maybe it's Perl and Larry Wall, or C# (is that the right one?) and Jon Skeet.  It may well be that these people are not the best teachers, but they sure make up for it in the amount that they know!

And that's what mathematicians are.  We're the people who write the actual language, who then write the libraries that you use.  Of course, you don't have to know how to prove a theorem - you're not going to write a library!  But if you know a bit about how we think, then it might help you understand why we wrote the library the way we did, and if you understand that it might help you make better use of it.

There is a middle ground between looking up equations on Wikipedia and proving the Poincar&eacute; conjecture, just as - to refer to Lockhart's lament - there is a middle ground between ""I don't really know much about art, but I know what I like"" and being Monet, and between ""Where's the 'ANY' key?"" and being Don Knuth.  If you are still in university then you have an amazing opportunity to learn from people who are experts in their area and who - for some reason - are willing to spend their time explaining it to you.



The other point I wanted to expand on a bit was why as a programmer you should not be scared of learning a bit more mathematics.  It's not the Deep Connections, nor the usefulness.  It's that your ability to program a computer can directly help you learn mathematics.  I just want to mention a few.


Understanding variables.  So many people get confused by simple statements like ""Let n be a natural number ..."".  Or ""Let epsilon > 0"".  There are places in mathematics where it's important to remember the scope of a variable.  These are all commonplace in programming.  Learn to translate a mathematical statement into a program and you'll find it much easier to keep track of what's what.
The nature of proof.  If you've ever written a test, or written a program to be used by someone else, then you understand the core of proofs.  When you do that, you have to know that whatever the user puts in, you can deal with it (insert obligatory xkcd reference here).  That's all a proof is!  A demonstration that whatever the ""user/universe"" puts in, the statement will hold.  Experimentalists will lean to the ""If it works under normal circumstances, it's true"" but programmers know that there is always that kid who will try Alt+G+Shift+ÅØÆ just to see what happens.
DRY.  Sorry to break this to you, but we invented it, not you.  We've been ""not repeating ourselves"" for millennia.  That's why I have a copy of Euclid's elements on my shelves and it's still useful.


And there's more.  If I knew a bit more about programming, I'd write a book called ""Mathematics for Programmers"" where the aim wasn't to teach ""The mathematics that programmers should know"" but ""mathematics that everyone should know, but optimised for programmers"".  But I'll probably never know enough about programming to write it - unless someone offers to collaborate with me!



I'll leave it there.  Probably if I thought more, I'd change what I've written; hopefully I'd explain it better.  In a months' time I might even disagree with parts of it.  If anyone wishes to argue further, or comment otherwise, probably best not to do so in the comments here.  You know where to find me.

As such, the bones that you have are in fact ribs, and they're quite easy to remove from the remainder of the meat. Because of the muscle that's between the bones, connecting them, they can be treated as their own layer. All you have to do is free that whole layer from the layer that is just meat. Really, this sounds more complicated than it is.

Lay the breast flat on a board, with the bones on top, ends towards you. Use your boning/filet knife, narrow-bladed slicer, or even a paring knife.

To set yourself up for the cut you'll use for the majority of this process, you need to get the first bone (the one on the side opposite your knife hand) free. With the knife held vertically, cut along the outer edge of that bone, trying to not go deeper than the bone. Just disconnect that side from the meat.

Now, holding the blade parallel to the board, get right under the end of the bone with the tip of the knife. Make a small cut across the breadth of the bone. Ideally the face of the blade should be making contact with the underside of the  bone as you cut -- not cutting into the bone, but taking as much meat as possible. Don't sweat it, though: whatever's left attached to the ribs will make a very nice stock.

Make small but smooth cuts further in along the bone, digging out a little slit underneath it. Once you're two or three inches in, move to the next bone in line, and separate it in the same way. You've now got a corner that you can lift up to make it easier to get your knife in there. 

Go back to the first bone, and pull up on that corner. Now make your cuts diagonal to the lines of the bones, so that you're separating the first bone further along than the second. Keep the blade parallel to the board, and don't try to do too much at once -- go long but not deep, slicing lightly along the whole underside crease right where the bone and meat are connected, to a quarter inch or so depth. Readjust your grip on the top half, and make another cut.

(If you have a big enough board and table, you might find it easier to turn the breast so the corner you're working from is pointed towards you at this point.) 

Repeat that cut all the way across the breast, and keep using your free hand to lift the top part away as you cut. This obviously gives you a better view, but it also actually assists the separation. The meat and the bones are less well-connected to each other than the meat is to itself -- when you put the join under tension, it wants to come apart.

Depending on the size of your slab, once you've got more than a few bones free, constantly lifting the top half may start to be cumbersome. At that point, you can completely separate some of those bones and set them aside -- just cut vertically along the meat between two of them.

That's all there is to it. Turn those ribs into something tasty, too!

3368,3368,5375,"Best practice for getting ""If not foo"" conditionals","So, here are two ways you might set things up such that \dostuff is done when foo is false.

The ""new conditional"" method

If you know when foo is going to be set, then after that do:

\newif\ifnotfoo
\iffoo\notfoofalse\else\notfootrue\fi


And then use the \ifnotfoo test.

\ifnotfoo\dostuff\fi

then you can replace the \iffoo construct with simply

(I ask this as someone who mostly enjoys games like Carcassonne, Power Grid, Agricola, Pandemic, etc. around the table at home.)  To be specific, the things that I think are important properties for these games are:


Needing minimal table space.  Most trains have a small table you could use, but not much more.
Being quiet to play, so that other passengers won't be disturbed.  For example, I imagine that games that involve repeatedly rolling dice wouldn't be appreciated.
Packing down small, so that they don't take up much luggage space.
Not requiring batteries or a power socket.  (I appreciate that an iPhone or a Nintendo DS for each player might be a good solution more generally, but it's not what I'm after in this case.)
Not being so delicate to arrange that motion from the train will unduly disrupt the play.


I think it would be best to recommend one game (or class of games) per answer, if that's appropriate, and explain why you think it's particularly suitable.  (Incidentally, I've read the guidance on good questions about game recommendations and hope this question meets the criteria.)

2427,2427,3868,Practical use and applications of improper integrals,"What are the most important applications of improper integrals, in particular to computer science and related fields, and to technology and engineering in general?

I know that improper integrals are very common in probability and statistics; also, the Laplace transform, the Fourier transform and many special functions like Beta and Gamma are defined using improper integrals, which appear in a lot of problems and computations. But what about their direct, practical applications in real life situations?

Any insight is much appreciated!

869,869,1378,Is it ethical to profit by having my students buy my textbook?,"This question was suggested to me by How can I sell my text book to my students in e-book format? which asked about the practicalities, but attracted many comments about the ethics.  So this question is to ask about the ethics directly.

Suppose I have written and published a textbook, and I want to use it as the text for a course I am teaching.  I receive royalties from each copy of my book that is sold, so if my students are required to buy my textbook for the course, I will make some money.  Is it ethical to do so?

Well-reasoned opinions would be useful answers, but even more useful would be pointers to institutional policies, professional codes of ethics, etc, that address this issue.

Of course, there are many ways to avoid profiting from the sale of my book to my students.  If my contract with my publisher allows it, I could distribute PDFs to my students, or have the university bookstore print out copies and sell them at cost.  Another approach I've heard of is to compute how much I earn in royalties on each copy, and refund that amount from my pocket to each student who buys a copy.  Or, use my royalty earnings to buy pizza for the class.  Certainly these are nice gestures, but I would like opinions on whether they are ethically required.

Edit: To address some questions that have arisen in the comments:


This question is hypothetical.  I haven't published any textbooks myself and have no immediate plans to do so.  In any case, my personal preference would be to make the book available to students for free, if at all possible.  So I've phrased this question in the first person for rhetorical convenience only.
I had intended the question to be only about the potential financial conflict of interest that could arise if I make money by assigning my own book.  Some of the answers feel that it is improper for me to assign my own textbook at all, whether I make money or not, but I don't think this point of view is prevalent within the academic community.  If it happens that my book (as a pithy but now-deleted comment put it) ""blows"", I think most would agree that my decision to assign it is pedagogically unfortunate, but not unethical.  
I don't literally mean that students would be required to buy the book, only that they'd be expected to have it.  I might assign readings or homework problems from the book, so that the student needs access to the book in order to do them, but they could certainly achieve this by getting a used copy or borrowing from a friend.  But probably most students would buy new copies anyway, since that is the most convenient way.

",Nate Eldredge,https://academia.stackexchange.com/users/1010,"Unethical

I think it is unethical to profit by having students buy your textbook because you're their lecturer and they expect you to inform them and provide them with some useful resources for learning. The students also usually get a bad feeling when you keep recommending your book unless it was vote one of the best to use in tackling the given subject. I don't know/understand how you may be able to provide other books to your students at no cost while you provide your book at a cost. It looks fishy. If you feel that you can't give each student a copy of the book then you can recommend the university to buy the books so as to restock the library or you can offer your own copy or a single donated copy strictly for class use. This depends on the number of students you're dealing with and how often they have to use the book.

Ethical

In a case where you had published the book before meeting the students, you're allowed to sell the book to them at the market price or you may subsidize it for your students.

Its always difficult to teach using your book especially when you reach a point where there are few discrepancy from other books. In the process of defending your ideas from the book, you may end up being seen as superior, dictator, rigid etc.

I am writing a query in Informix and have been stuck on the where clause.  I have 2 CSQnames that I want to select and certain times and all others I want to show in between another time.  My query ran perfectly until I added this specific where statement.  If anyone can offer suggestions I would really appreciate it.  I am getting a general error.  In Informix since I am unable to put a if then statement in the where clause how would I rewrite my syntax?  Thanks!

Can such a thing be done?  I have a vague idea that I might make a text file with a list of the new names and call that list @newnames.  I would make another array out of the current file names, and call it @oldnames.  I'd then do some kind of for loop where each element $i in @oldnames is replaced by the corresponding $i in @newnames.

I don't know how to make an array out of my current file names, though, and so I'm not sure if this vague idea is on the right track.  I keep my files with the messed-up names in a directory called 'oldnames'. The below is my attempt to make an array out of the file names in that directory:

#!/usr/bin/perl -w
use strict; use warnings;

my $dir = 'oldnames';
opendir ('oldnames', $dir) or die ""cannot open dir $dir: $!"";
my @file = readdir 'oldnames';
closedir 'oldnames';

print ""@file\n"";


The above didn't seem to do anything. I'm lost. Help?
",user2585169,https://stackoverflow.com/users/2585169,"Can you do this with rename? It does allow you to use perl code and expressions as arguments if I recall.

The real answer is the one by @chrsblck it does some checks and doesn't make a mess. 

For comparison here is a messy one liner that may suffice.  It relies on you providing a list of equivalent new file names that will rename your list of old files in the correct order.  Perhaps for your situation (where you don't want to do any programmatic transformation of the files names) you could just use a shell loop (see the end of this post) reading lists of new and old names from a file. A better perl solution would be to put both of these file name lists into two columns and then that file using the -a switch , @F and  then useFile::Copy to copy the files around. 

Anyway, below are some suggestions. 

First, set things up: 

 % vim newfilenames.txt # list new names one per line corresponding to old names.
 % wc -l newfilenames.txt # the same number of new names as files in ./oldfiles/
  8 newfilenames.txt
 % ls -1 oldfiles  # 8 files rename these in order to list from newfilenames.txt

With files arranged as above, copy everything over:

perl -MFile::Copy -E 'opendir($dh , oldfiles); @newfiles=`cat newfilenames.txt`; chomp @newfiles; @oldfiles = sort grep(/^.+\..+$/, readdir $dh); END {for $i (0..$#oldfiles){copy(""oldfiles/$oldfiles[$i]"", ""newfiles/$newfiles[$i]""); }}'


Not pretty: you have to grep andsort on @oldfiles to get rid of . .. and put the array elments in order. And there's always the risk that a typo could make a mess and it would be hard to figure out.
If you put the old and new names in a couple of files you could just do this with this with a shell script:

for i in `cat ../oldfilenames.txt` ; do ; done; for n in `cat ../newfilenames.txt`; do cp $i $n;


or just cd into  the directory with the old files and do:

mkdir new
for i in * ; do ; done; for n in `cat ../newfilenames.txt`; do cp $i new/$n;

SEACODI_07B_A.4_sww2320H_2403F.fsa

SEACODI_07G_Rb.4_sww2320H_2403F.fsa
SEACODI_07H_Rb.9_sww2320H_2403F.fsa


Can such a thing be done?  I have a vague idea that I might make a text file with a list of the new names and call that list @newnames.  I would make another array out of the current file names, and call it @oldnames.  I'd then do some kind of for loop where each element $i in @oldnames is replaced by the corresponding $i in @newnames.

I don't know how to make an array out of my current file names, though, and so I'm not sure if this vague idea is on the right track.  I keep my files with the messed-up names in a directory called 'oldnames'. The below is my attempt to make an array out of the file names in that directory:

#!/usr/bin/perl -w
use strict; use warnings;

my $dir = 'oldnames';
opendir ('oldnames', $dir) or die ""cannot open dir $dir: $!"";
my @file = readdir 'oldnames';
closedir 'oldnames';

print ""@file\n"";


The above didn't seem to do anything. I'm lost. Help?
","Can you do this with rename? It does allow you to use perl code and expressions as arguments if I recall.

The real answer is the one by @chrsblck it does some checks and doesn't make a mess. 

For comparison here is a messy one liner that may suffice.  It relies on you providing a list of equivalent new file names that will rename your list of old files in the correct order.  Perhaps for your situation (where you don't want to do any programmatic transformation of the files names) you could just use a shell loop (see the end of this post) reading lists of new and old names from a file. A better perl solution would be to put both of these file name lists into two columns and then that file using the -a switch , @F and  then useFile::Copy to copy the files around. 

Anyway, below are some suggestions. 

First, set things up: 

 % vim newfilenames.txt # list new names one per line corresponding to old names.
 % wc -l newfilenames.txt # the same number of new names as files in ./oldfiles/
  8 newfilenames.txt
 % ls -1 oldfiles  # 8 files rename these in order to list from newfilenames.txt

 newSEACODI-sww2320H-sww24_07H_R.5_sww2320H_sww2403F.fsa


With files arranged as above, copy everything over:

perl -MFile::Copy -E 'opendir($dh , oldfiles); @newfiles=`cat newfilenames.txt`; chomp @newfiles; @oldfiles = sort grep(/^.+\..+$/, readdir $dh); END {for $i (0..$#oldfiles){copy(""oldfiles/$oldfiles[$i]"", ""newfiles/$newfiles[$i]""); }}'


Not pretty: you have to grep andsort on @oldfiles to get rid of . .. and put the array elments in order. And there's always the risk that a typo could make a mess and it would be hard to figure out.
If you put the old and new names in a couple of files you could just do this with this with a shell script:

for i in `cat ../oldfilenames.txt` ; do ; done; for n in `cat ../newfilenames.txt`; do cp $i $n;


or just cd into  the directory with the old files and do:

mkdir new
for i in * ; do ; done; for n in `cat ../newfilenames.txt`; do cp $i new/$n;


Good luck!

How do I add chacing to this last snippet?
",Bram Vanroy,https://wordpress.stackexchange.com/users/16574,"I don't think you need so many transients set, one for each category. You can only use one, that is enough. Transients are quite expensive to set as it requires additional db queries, so you would want to cut down on the use.

As always, I like to keep my templates simple, short and sweet, so I tend to write custom functions to move the bulk of the code outside my templates. You can put everything in one function with one transient

You can try something like this (Requires PHP 5.4+)

function get_term_post_list( $taxonomy = 'category', $args = [], $query_args = [] )  
{
    /*
     * Check if we have a transient set
     */

        $output = ''; 
        foreach ( $terms as $term ) {

            $output .= '&lt;div class=""subject""&gt;';
            $output .= '&lt;h3&gt;' . $term-&gt;name . '&lt;/h3&gt;';
            $output .= '&lt;ul&gt;';

            /*
             * Use a tax_query to make this dynamic for all taxonomies
             */
            $default_args = [

                'tax_query' =&gt; [
                    [
                        'taxonomy' =&gt; $taxonomy,
                        'terms' =&gt; $term-&gt;term_id,

FEW NOTES


The first parameter, $taxonomy is the taxonomy to get terms and posts from. It defaults to 'category'
The second parameter is $args which is the arguments which should be passed to get_terms(). For more info, check get_terms()
The third parameter, $query_args is the arguments that should be passed to the custom query. Remember to avoid using any taxonomy related parameters. For more info, see WP_Query
If the second parameter is not set and the third parameter is set, pass an empty array to the second parameter
Modify and abuse the code as you see fit


USAGE

You can now use the function as follow in your templates

$post_list = get_term_post_list( 'category', ['exclude' =&gt; '1, 4, 9, 10, 2899'], ['posts_per_page' =&gt; 3] );
if ( $post_list !== null ) {
    echo $post_list;
}


If you do not pass anything to the second parameter but to the third, you should do the following (pass empty array)

$post_list = get_term_post_list( 'category', [], ['posts_per_page' =&gt; 3] );
if ( $post_list !== null ) {
    echo $post_list;
}


EDIT

In a rush, I totally forgot to add a function to flush the transient when a new post is published, updated, deleted or undeleted. As your code stands, the list will only be updated when the transient expires. 

To flush the transient on the above post conditions, simply use the transition_post_status hook. Add the following to your functions.php

add_action( 'transition_post_status', function ()
{
        global $wpdb;
        $wpdb-&gt;query( ""DELETE FROM $wpdb-&gt;options WHERE `option_name` LIKE ('_transient%_term_list_%')"" );
        $wpdb-&gt;query( ""DELETE FROM $wpdb-&gt;options WHERE `option_name` LIKE ('_transient_timeout%_term_list_%')"" );
});


EDIT 2

From your comment to this answer


  As you might have guessed I'd liked to use this in combination with my other question. How would I go about doing that? Should the exclusion of the terms happen in get_term_post_list()? Or should the two functions be merged somehow? (As I don't need them seperately.) 


The best way to accomplish is to merge the two functions into one. That would make the most sense. I have merged the two functions and modified the functionality with the exclude parameters. What I have done is, you can now add an array of term id's to excludse via the get_terms() exclude parameter and you can also within the same function set an array of term slugs to exclude. The results will be merged into one single exclude parameter before being passed to get_terms()

Here is the function, again I have commented it well to make it easy to follow (This goes into functions.php)

function get_term_post_list( $taxonomy = 'category', $args = [], $query_args = [], $exclude_by_slug = [] )  
{
    /*
     * Check if we have a transient set
     */
    if ( false === ( $output = get_transient( 'term_list_' . md5( $taxonomy . json_encode( $args ) . json_encode( $query_args ) ) ) ) ) {

        /*
         * Check if any array of slugs is passed and if it is a valid array
         */
        if ( is_array( $exclude_by_slug ) &amp;&amp; !empty( $exclude_by_slug ) ) {

            foreach ( $exclude_by_slug as $value ) {

                /*
                 * Use get_term_by to get the term ID and add ID's to an array
                 */
                $term_objects = get_term_by( 'slug', $value, $taxonomy );
                $term_ids[] = (int) $term_objects-&gt;term_id;

            }

        }

As far as usage, you first need to look at the parameters that you can pass


Parameter 1 - $taxonomy -> taxonomy to get terms from. Default category
Parameter 2 - $args -> The arguments that should be passed to get_terms(). Please see get_terms() for a full list of parameters that can be passed as an array. Default empty array []
Parameter 3 - $query_args -> Custom argument to be passed to WP_Query. You should not pass taxonomy related parameters here as it cause issues with the deafult build in tax_query. For a full list of valid arguments which can be passed in an array, see WP_Query. Default empty array []
Parameter 4 - $exclude_by_slug -> An array of slugs to exclude. Please note, this has to be a valid array for this to work. Strings will be ignored. Default empty array []


You can now call the function in any of your template files as

$a = get_term_post_list( 'category', ['exclude' =&gt; [1, 13, 42]], ['posts_per_page' =&gt; 3], ['term-slug-1', 'term-slug-2'] );
echo $a;


OR

$taxonomy = 'category';
$args = [
    'exclude' =&gt; [1, 13, 42]
];
$query_args = [
    'posts_per_page' =&gt; 3
];
$exclude_by_slug = [
    '0' =&gt; ['term-slug-1', 'term-slug-2']
];
$a = get_term_post_list( $taxonomy, $args, $query_args, $exclude_by_slug );
echo $a;


Final note, if you don't need to pass a specific parameter, remember to just pass an empty array like

$a = get_term_post_list( 'category', [], [], ['term-slug-1'] );
echo $a;

How do I add chacing to this last snippet?
","I don't think you need so many transients set, one for each category. You can only use one, that is enough. Transients are quite expensive to set as it requires additional db queries, so you would want to cut down on the use.

As always, I like to keep my templates simple, short and sweet, so I tend to write custom functions to move the bulk of the code outside my templates. You can put everything in one function with one transient

You can try something like this (Requires PHP 5.4+)

function get_term_post_list( $taxonomy = 'category', $args = [], $query_args = [] )  
{
    /*
     * Check if we have a transient set
     */
    if ( false === ( $output = get_transient( 'term_list_' . md5( $taxonomy . json_encode( $args ) . json_encode( $query_args ) ) ) ) ) {

        /*
         * Use get_terms to get an array of terms
         */
        $terms = get_terms( $taxonomy, $args );

       if ( is_wp_error( $terms ) || empty( $terms ) )
            return null;

        /*
         * We will create a string with our output
         */
        $output = ''; 
        foreach ( $terms as $term ) {

            $output .= '&lt;div class=""subject""&gt;';
            $output .= '&lt;h3&gt;' . $term-&gt;name . '&lt;/h3&gt;';
            $output .= '&lt;ul&gt;';

            /*
             * Use a tax_query to make this dynamic for all taxonomies
             */
            $default_args = [
                'no_found_rows' =&gt; true,
                'suppress_filters' =&gt; true,
                'tax_query' =&gt; [
                    [
                        'taxonomy' =&gt; $taxonomy,
                        'terms' =&gt; $term-&gt;term_id,
                        'include_children' =&gt; false
                    ]

            $q = new WP_Query( $merged_args );

            while($q-&gt;have_posts()) {
                $q-&gt;the_post();

                $output .= '&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""' . get_permalink() . '"" title=""' . apply_filters( 'the_title', get_the_title() ) . '""&gt;' . apply_filters( 'the_title', get_the_title() ) . '&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;';

            }
            wp_reset_postdata();

     * $output will be atring, treat as such
     */
    return $output;
}


FEW NOTES


The first parameter, $taxonomy is the taxonomy to get terms and posts from. It defaults to 'category'
The second parameter is $args which is the arguments which should be passed to get_terms(). For more info, check get_terms()
The third parameter, $query_args is the arguments that should be passed to the custom query. Remember to avoid using any taxonomy related parameters. For more info, see WP_Query
If the second parameter is not set and the third parameter is set, pass an empty array to the second parameter
Modify and abuse the code as you see fit


USAGE

You can now use the function as follow in your templates

$post_list = get_term_post_list( 'category', ['exclude' =&gt; '1, 4, 9, 10, 2899'], ['posts_per_page' =&gt; 3] );
if ( $post_list !== null ) {
    echo $post_list;
}


If you do not pass anything to the second parameter but to the third, you should do the following (pass empty array)

$post_list = get_term_post_list( 'category', [], ['posts_per_page' =&gt; 3] );
if ( $post_list !== null ) {
    echo $post_list;
}


EDIT

In a rush, I totally forgot to add a function to flush the transient when a new post is published, updated, deleted or undeleted. As your code stands, the list will only be updated when the transient expires. 

To flush the transient on the above post conditions, simply use the transition_post_status hook. Add the following to your functions.php

add_action( 'transition_post_status', function ()
{
        global $wpdb;
        $wpdb-&gt;query( ""DELETE FROM $wpdb-&gt;options WHERE `option_name` LIKE ('_transient%_term_list_%')"" );
        $wpdb-&gt;query( ""DELETE FROM $wpdb-&gt;options WHERE `option_name` LIKE ('_transient_timeout%_term_list_%')"" );
});


EDIT 2

From your comment to this answer


  As you might have guessed I'd liked to use this in combination with my other question. How would I go about doing that? Should the exclusion of the terms happen in get_term_post_list()? Or should the two functions be merged somehow? (As I don't need them seperately.) 


The best way to accomplish is to merge the two functions into one. That would make the most sense. I have merged the two functions and modified the functionality with the exclude parameters. What I have done is, you can now add an array of term id's to excludse via the get_terms() exclude parameter and you can also within the same function set an array of term slugs to exclude. The results will be merged into one single exclude parameter before being passed to get_terms()

Here is the function, again I have commented it well to make it easy to follow (This goes into functions.php)

function get_term_post_list( $taxonomy = 'category', $args = [], $query_args = [], $exclude_by_slug = [] )  
{
    /*
     * Check if we have a transient set
     */
    if ( false === ( $output = get_transient( 'term_list_' . md5( $taxonomy . json_encode( $args ) . json_encode( $query_args ) ) ) ) ) {

        /*
         * Check if any array of slugs is passed and if it is a valid array
         */
        if ( is_array( $exclude_by_slug ) &amp;&amp; !empty( $exclude_by_slug ) ) {

            foreach ( $exclude_by_slug as $value ) {

                /*
                 * Use get_term_by to get the term ID and add ID's to an array
                 */
                $term_objects = get_term_by( 'slug', $value, $taxonomy );
                $term_ids[] = (int) $term_objects-&gt;term_id;

            }

        }

        /*
         * Merge $args['exclude'] and $term_ids 
         */
        if ( isset( $args['exclude'] ) &amp;&amp; isset( $term_ids ) ) {

            $excluded_args = (array) $args['exclude'];
            unset( $args['exclude'] );
            $args['exclude'] = array_merge( $excluded_args, $term_ids );

        } elseif ( !isset( $args['exclude'] ) &amp;&amp; isset( $term_ids ) ) {

            $args['exclude'] = $term_ids;

        } 

        /*
         * Use get_terms to get an array of terms
         */
        $terms = get_terms( $taxonomy, $args );

            return null;

        /*

            while($q-&gt;have_posts()) {
                $q-&gt;the_post();

     * $output will be string, treat as such

As far as usage, you first need to look at the parameters that you can pass


Parameter 1 - $taxonomy -> taxonomy to get terms from. Default category
Parameter 2 - $args -> The arguments that should be passed to get_terms(). Please see get_terms() for a full list of parameters that can be passed as an array. Default empty array []
Parameter 3 - $query_args -> Custom argument to be passed to WP_Query. You should not pass taxonomy related parameters here as it cause issues with the deafult build in tax_query. For a full list of valid arguments which can be passed in an array, see WP_Query. Default empty array []
Parameter 4 - $exclude_by_slug -> An array of slugs to exclude. Please note, this has to be a valid array for this to work. Strings will be ignored. Default empty array []


You can now call the function in any of your template files as

$a = get_term_post_list( 'category', ['exclude' =&gt; [1, 13, 42]], ['posts_per_page' =&gt; 3], ['term-slug-1', 'term-slug-2'] );
echo $a;


OR

$taxonomy = 'category';
$args = [
    'exclude' =&gt; [1, 13, 42]
];
$query_args = [
    'posts_per_page' =&gt; 3
];
$exclude_by_slug = [
    '0' =&gt; ['term-slug-1', 'term-slug-2']
];
$a = get_term_post_list( $taxonomy, $args, $query_args, $exclude_by_slug );
echo $a;


Final note, if you don't need to pass a specific parameter, remember to just pass an empty array like

$a = get_term_post_list( 'category', [], [], ['term-slug-1'] );
echo $a;


All the above replaces all your code in your question

3060,3060,4874,Lychrel calculator (Project Euler 55),"
  If we take 47, reverse and add, 47 + 74 = 121, which is palindromic.
  
  Not all numbers produce palindromes so quickly. For example,

349 + 943 = 1292,
1292 + 2921 = 4213
4213 + 3124 = 7337

  
  That is, 349 took three iterations to arrive at a palindrome.
  
  Although no one has proved it yet, it is thought that some numbers,
  like 196, never produce a palindrome. A number that never forms a
  palindrome through the reverse and add process is called a Lychrel
  number. Due to the theoretical nature of these numbers, and for the
  purpose of this problem, we shall assume that a number is Lychrel
  until proven otherwise. In addition you are given that for every
  number below ten-thousand, it will either (i) become a palindrome in
  less than fifty iterations, or, (ii) no one, with all the computing
  power that exists, has managed so far to map it to a palindrome. In
  fact, 10677 is the first number to be shown to require over fifty
  iterations before producing a palindrome: 4668731596684224866951378664
  (53 iterations, 28-digits).
  
  Surprisingly, there are palindromic numbers that are themselves
  Lychrel numbers; the first example is 4994.
  
  How many Lychrel numbers are there below ten-thousand?


This is my solution:

from datetime import datetime

candidates = []

def reverse(number):
    ''' Returns the reverse order of an integer,
        for example: reverse(123) returns the integer 321 '''
    number = str(number)
    return int(number[::-1])

def is_lychrel(number):
    ''' Returns True if 'number' is a lychrel candidate,
        but works only with numbers from 1 to 10000 '''
    iterated = number + reverse(number)
    for i in range(25):
        rev_iterated = reverse(iterated)
        if iterated != rev_iterated:
            iterated = iterated + rev_iterated

    time = datetime.now() - start_time # To get the time of the calculation

    print(' '.join(map(str, candidates)), 'are candidates.')

",matheussilvapb,https://codereview.stackexchange.com/users/37913,"1. Comments on your code


Python has a built-in module, timeit, for measuring the execution time of small code snippets. So there is no need for all that fussing about with datetime.
Project Euler problem 55 says:


  you are given that for every number below ten thousand, it will either (i) become a palindrome in less than fifty iterations


but your code only tries 25 iterations. It happens to be the case that 25 iterations are enough in this case, but how did you figure that out? If you had a mathematical proof that showed that 25 iterations were enough, then that would be fair enough, but I suspect that in fact you re-ran the program with different values for the count of iterations until you found that smallest one that produces the right answer. This seems like cheating to me: if you are willing to do that, why not just replace the whole program with:

print(answer)


which would be even faster?
The problem statement asks:


  How many Lychrel numbers are there below ten-thousand?


but you test range(10001) which is off by one. Luckily for you, 10,000 is not a Lychrel number, so this doesn't lead to an error.
You've made candidates into a global variable, and run some of your code at top level. This makes it hard to test your program from the interactive interpreter. You need something like this:

def problem55(n):
    """"""Return a list of Lychrel candidates below n.""""""
    candidates = []
    for number in range(n):
        if is_lychrel(number):
            candidates.append(number)
    return candidates


and then you can test it like this:

&gt;&gt;&gt; from timeit import timeit
&gt;&gt;&gt; timeit(lambda:problem55(10000), number=100)
8.279778157011606



2. Speeding it up


The problem statement only asks how many Lychrel numbers there are, so there is no need to construct a list of them.
Function calls in Python are moderately expensive, so you can save some time by inlining them. This leads to an implementation like this:

def problem55_1(n, m):
    """"""Return the count of numbers below n that do not lead to a
    palindrome after m iterations of reversal and addition.

    """"""
    count = 0
    for i in range(n):
        r = int(str(i)[::-1])
        for _ in range(m):
            i += r
            r = int(str(i)[::-1])
            if i == r:
                break
        else:
            count += 1
    return count


which is about 16% faster than yours:

&gt;&gt;&gt; timeit(lambda:problem55_1(10000, 50), number=100)
6.93482669594232

Janne suggested that you could speed things up by caching the numbers already found to be Lychrel and non-Lychrel, and you replied:


  doing that is going to require more conditions and probably is going to be the same running time or even worse


which is a bit of a defeatist attitude. Certainly the code gets more complex when you add caching, but it's not a priori obvious whether this costs more than it saves, or saves more than it costs. The best way to find out is to knuckle down and try it:

def problem55_2(n, m):
    """"""Return the count of numbers below n that do not lead to a
    palindrome after m iterations of reversal and addition.

    """"""
    lychrel = set()
    nonlychrel = set()
    count = 0
    for i in range(n):
        j = i
        if i in lychrel:
            count += 1
            continue
        stack = [i]
        r = int(str(i)[::-1])
        for _ in range(m):
            i += r
            if i in lychrel:
                count += 1
                lychrel.update(stack)
                break
            if i in nonlychrel:
                nonlychrel.update(stack)
                break
            stack.append(i)
            r = int(str(i)[::-1])
            if i == r:
                nonlychrel.update(stack)
                break
        else:
            count += 1
            lychrel.update(stack)
    return count


I find that this is about twice as fast as your code:

&gt;&gt;&gt; timeit(lambda:problem55_2(10000, 50), number=100)
3.935654202941805

One final tweak from me. Now that we are caching, the order in which we check numbers for the Lychrel property matters. As you iterate the reverse-and-add process, the numbers get bigger. So if we start with the larger numbers and proceed downwards, then we are more likely to get cache hits. So I tried replacing the line:

    for i in range(n):


with

    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):


and got a further small speedup:

&gt;&gt;&gt; timeit(lambda:problem55_3(10000, 50), number=100)

I find that this is about twice as fast as your code:

&gt;&gt;&gt; timeit(lambda:problem55_2(10000, 50), number=100)
3.935654202941805

One final tweak from me. Now that we are caching, the order in which we check numbers for the Lychrel property matters. As you iterate the reverse-and-add process, the numbers get bigger. So if we start with the larger numbers and proceed downwards, then we are more likely to get cache hits. So I tried replacing the line:

    for i in range(n):


with

    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):


and got a further small speedup:

&gt;&gt;&gt; timeit(lambda:problem55_3(10000, 50), number=100)

1117,1117,1754,What's the best way to generate an NPC's face using web technologies?,"I'm in the process of creating a web app. I have many randomly-generated non-player characters in a database.

For this, I am solely interested in generating a graphical representation of the face. Currently the information is displayed with text in the nicest way possible, but I believe it's worth generating these faces for a more... human experience.

Problem is, I don't know where to start. Were it 2007, I'd naturally think to myself that using Flash would be the best choice. I'd love to see ""breathing"" simulated. However, since Flash is on its way out, I'm not sure of a solid solution.

You are misunderstanding it. The microwave is required to send the d-mail, not to receive it. 

Basically, the d-mail functions exactly as a normal text message that you would send to someone. The only difference (apart from the size limit) is that when you send a normal message, it will arrive in some time after being sent. The d-mail, on the contrary, will arrive in some time before being sent. It can be sent to any phone (or a pager), the only requirement is obviously that you need to know the phone number.

I just accidentally sent a license agreement for something that was downloading &amp; installing, to the printer as it popped up once it had downloaded, while I was typing a url into Chrome. If I didn't quickly cancel it I'd have had to wait while 53 pages printed while I reflected on what had happened.

What can application developers, or the OS itself do to minimize these problems?
","Two things are possible:


Do not force the application to gain focus. Show the message and keep waiting till user switches to the application.
Implement blinking notifications. This is OS dependent. May or may not be feasible in other OS but in Windows operating system, there is system tray (systray in short). Application can be coded in such a way that if user attention is required and the application is not in view, application can put a blinking or baloon notification in the systray.

3438,3438,5468,Developing a dynamic language,"I have created several hand written compilers for very simple languages but now I want to try my hand at developing a dynamic language, similar to a simplified Python or Ruby.  However, it was easy for me to wrap my head around how compilers work.  Primitive compilers just translate.  But I can't do this if the language is dynamic.  I have to write an interpreter or VM that keeps track of information at runtime and puts a lot more work on me.

In short, are there any resources I should check out considering I know how compilers work but want to migrate to creating an interpreter?  There are a few VMs out there for dynamic languages, but I have no problem with rolling my own.  This is all just for my personal experience.

EDIT: I am seeking information on how to go from a compiler to an interpreter.  If I have already made a compiler for language X but now what to write an interpreter, what needs to be done and are there any resources that go over the process?

I do not want broad or abstract resources that go over how compilers or virtual machines work.  I have plenty of textbooks on the subject.  All of the resources I found online either assume you have 0 experience and thus start you off with lexical or syntactic analysis or they are extremely abstract.  I have a working compiler, but I now want to turn this into an interpreter and add dynamic features to the language.

I could not find resources on this process, it may be too limited in scope, or resources on the ""back end"" of an interpreter without being too theoretical which is why I posted here.
",Austin Henley,https://programmers.stackexchange.com/users/37315,"If you want to learn the basics of implementing an interpreter for a dynamic language, I can't imagine a better place to start than the origins of the very first dynamic, interpreted programming language: Lisp. 

In his original 1960 paper, John McCarthy defined 5 primitive functions necessary to a Lisp. Of course, McCarthy only intended his paper on Lisp as an academic exercise; it was a graduate student who implmented eval in assembly and created the first Lisp interpreter. Paul Graham identifies seven primitives: quote, atom, eq, cons, car, cdr, and cond. 

The thing is, you can really implement Lisp in any language; once you implement eval, it's easy to set up a REPL, and you have an interactive interpreter. People have been bored or curious enough to implement Lisps in C, Java, Ruby, Python, and many other languages. And not always on purpose; it's important to remember Greenspun's Tenth Rule: 


  Any sufficiently complicated C or Fortran program contains an ad hoc, informally-specified, bug-ridden, slow implementation of half of Common Lisp.


I'm not saying your end-goal should be a Lisp implementation; but homoiconicity has its benefits when learning to implement a dynamic language; why deal with syntax issues when you can learn on a language in which the idiomatic syntax is identical toe the AST of a language that uses a lexer/parser?

Anyhow... just a suggestion. But it is with good reason that most of the great programming languages since C have at least a little of the Lisp-nature.

All of the resources I found online either assume you have 0 experience and thus start you off with lexical or syntactic analysis or they are extremely abstract.  I have a working compiler, but I now want to turn this into an interpreter and add dynamic features to the language.

I could not find resources on this process, it may be too limited in scope, or resources on the ""back end"" of an interpreter without being too theoretical which is why I posted here.
","If you want to learn the basics of implementing an interpreter for a dynamic language, I can't imagine a better place to start than the origins of the very first dynamic, interpreted programming language: Lisp. 

In his original 1960 paper, John McCarthy defined 5 primitive functions necessary to a Lisp. Of course, McCarthy only intended his paper on Lisp as an academic exercise; it was a graduate student who implmented eval in assembly and created the first Lisp interpreter. Paul Graham identifies seven primitives: quote, atom, eq, cons, car, cdr, and cond. 

The thing is, you can really implement Lisp in any language; once you implement eval, it's easy to set up a REPL, and you have an interactive interpreter. People have been bored or curious enough to implement Lisps in C, Java, Ruby, Python, and many other languages. And not always on purpose; it's important to remember Greenspun's Tenth Rule: 


  Any sufficiently complicated C or Fortran program contains an ad hoc, informally-specified, bug-ridden, slow implementation of half of Common Lisp.


I'm not saying your end-goal should be a Lisp implementation; but homoiconicity has its benefits when learning to implement a dynamic language; why deal with syntax issues when you can learn on a language in which the idiomatic syntax is identical toe the AST of a language that uses a lexer/parser?

Anyhow... just a suggestion. But it is with good reason that most of the great programming languages since C have at least a little of the Lisp-nature.

",Izumi-reiLuLu,https://scifi.stackexchange.com/users/20797,"Much like the fairy tales they are based on, the show has been very vague about exactly what Regina was ""queen"" over when she was the Evil Queen. However, I think it was less than your questions imply, because we've seen more than one king/queen ruling within the bounds of the Enchanted Forest:


Regina married Snow White's father, King Leopold.
David (Charming) is the adoptive son of King George.
David also has to do a favor for King Midas
Maleficent was nomimally the Queen of her own kingdom.
Princess Aurora was presumably the daughter of yet another King/Queen.


So, legally, I suspect Regina was ""only"" the Queen of one of several kingdoms in the Enchanted Forest, though the boundaries of that kingdom are never spelled out.

However, Regina was also one of the most powerful rulers in the Enchanted Forest, in particular because of the powerful magic that she possessed. Thus, I assume that once she became The Evil Queen, she would have started to enforce her will beyond it's normal borders. We can sort-of imply this by the fact that no one ever mentions going to other Kings for help with Regina, e.g. Charming never even considers asking his father for help with Regina. In fact, other than flashbacks, we don't see much of anything out of the other rules of the Enchanted Forest (except possibly Maleficent, who appeared to still be ruling over her kingdom when Charming encounters her.)

As far as how much of the land in her kingdom did she own, that's a bit of a tricky question that relates to medieval politics and ownership laws. Generally speaking, if her kingdom were modeled after a typical feudal society (as evidenced by the existence of titular knights), all of the land would have initially been owned by the king/queen, but would have been given to various lords as rewards for their fealty. Those lords would typically own the land and lease it to peasants and other working-class citizens in exchange for taxes or tithes. Exactly how much ownership transferred and what rights the king/queen still had over the land would depends on the specific laws of the country.

But again, in practice, if the king decided he wanted to reclaim ownership of some plot of land in his kingdom, no one would really stop him. Given Regina's strength, that goes even moreso for her.

",Aft3rmath,https://stackoverflow.com/users/1286212,"Generally there are two types of map application:

A) They display a map, (with or without  a user position) without needing to calculate a path like a navigation system does (see point B)

B) Application that use the vectors of a map and calculate something: e.g to find a best path. The shortest connection, e.g A navighation system , etc.

Application for A) are usually less complex then that of B), because the vectors can be somewhat inacurate, have no conections, have small gaps, have no logic between the edges, etc. 

1) To only display a building map, you would only need a list of edges. (An edge is pair of coordinates (x1,y1) - (x2,y2). How ever you get that. E.g MapInfo Professional format mif/mid. 
Or even you could dispaly a pdf that contains the map of the builing. Right with the built in PDF View, (also with SVG but more difficult). 

Things get much more complicated if it is not a relative map, but also a map that is positioned with an reference coordinate system, like latitude/longitude (WGS84).
In that case you would use a Tool (mapInfoProfessional, to import AutoCad DXF Files, and apply 3 GPS measured reference points at the corner of the house, and convert that to LatLong WGS84 coordinates system.
With ios you cannot measure that 3 Points because you cannot average a position,  ios stops sending when you are standing still at one corner of the house.
You could try to extract the positions from a google earth satellite foto if you are living in a region where google Sattelite fotos have high resolution. (But  this might violate the license conditions of that Satellite Foto provider (Topic: derived data))

Finally you now have a list of edges in Lat Lon coordinate System.

For Displaying I personally would either do with 1) OpenGL) or 2) Quartz2D.

Now the Path finding part.

Probaly you need a second ""map"" that defines the possible paths inside the building.
This structure must be a connect graph (points with connected neighbours).
Computer games do it that way. (Some even allow you to display that path in developper  mode)

The path can be drawn, in a different layer of the floor plan. But  this path
 has higher requirements: No gaps are allowed, all must be perfect connected.

Call that layer ""Path"" and export it as own plan.
Now use only this path layer, and import, and create a graph of nodes with connect neighbours.

Use Dijkstra Algo to search for shortest path.

With ios you cannot measure that 3 Points because you cannot average a position,  ios stops sending when you are standing still at one corner of the house.
You could try to extract the positions from a google earth satellite foto if you are living in a region where google Sattelite fotos have high resolution. (But  this might violate the license conditions of that Satellite Foto provider (Topic: derived data))

Finally you now have a list of edges in Lat Lon coordinate System.

For Displaying I personally would either do with 1) OpenGL) or 2) Quartz2D.

Now the Path finding part.

Probaly you need a second ""map"" that defines the possible paths inside the building.
This structure must be a connect graph (points with connected neighbours).
Computer games do it that way. (Some even allow you to display that path in developper  mode)

The path can be drawn, in a different layer of the floor plan. But  this path
 has higher requirements: No gaps are allowed, all must be perfect connected.

Call that layer ""Path"" and export it as own plan.
Now use only this path layer, and import, and create a graph of nodes with connect neighbours.

Use Dijkstra Algo to search for shortest path.

3702,3702,5902,How to drain power with pins for led matrix on atmega32 instead of using a led driver,"I want to make a led driver without the tlc594 series.
I use the atmega32 of which I can use 1 PWM pin.

1) Pin is high, led wont burn.
2) Pin is low, led will burn.

  My question is how to configure the pins so that: 1) Pin is high, led wont burn. 2) Pin is low, led will burn.


If you configure a pin as output, setting it to low will sink current and setting it to low will source current. As long as the Vcc supplying your LEDs is the same as the controller Vcc, you circuit should work as expected.

The atmega32 can safely sink/source about 20mA per IO. However, there are limitations regarding the total maximum per port and for all ports combined. It depends on the package type. For PDIP its about 100mA max per port and 200mA max total. Take a look at the ""DC characteristics"" section in the data sheet.

So using 4 LEDs as illustrated should work fine (assuming about 20mA per LED).

3465,3465,5519,struts2+spring3: passing a variable from action to jsp (javascript code),"First of all, thank you very much to all these that are trying to solve our problems in this forum;)

I am developing a web application with struts2+spring3. And I have a question about how to pass a variable (an array of arrays) from the action class to the jsp page.

I know that the only you need to do is to declare a private variable in my action and a get method for that variable and then its possible to access these variable from the jsp, I have done it and it works.

public class Workspace extends ActionSupport {

private String[][] objects=null;

public String[][] getObjects() {
    return objects;
}

public String execute() throws Exception{


The problem is that I want to access to this variable from the javascript code before loading the whole web page.

I have tried by different ways but it is never working.

$(function() {
var objectsMap=new Array();

    $(document).ready(function() {
          objectsMap = $objects;
    });


neither works (the alert says: ""Value: undefined""):

    &lt;s:set name=""auxObj"" value=""%{objects}""/&gt;
    &lt;script&gt;
        alert(""Value: ""+$(""#auxObj"").val());
    &lt;/script&gt;


Anyone have idea about how could I do that?

Whenever you want to assign JSP variables to JS, you need to let JSP print it as if it is JS code.

5551,5551,8818,"Good travel games for two players, especially for playing on trains?","I would be interested to hear if anyone had recommendations for 2-player games that are particularly suitable for playing while travelling on trains.  (I ask this as someone who mostly enjoys games like Carcassonne, Power Grid, Agricola, Pandemic, etc. around the table at home.)  To be specific, the things that I think are important properties for these games are:


Needing minimal table space.  Most trains have a small table you could use, but not much more.
Being quiet to play, so that other passengers won't be disturbed.  For example, I imagine that games that involve repeatedly rolling dice wouldn't be appreciated.
Packing down small, so that they don't take up much luggage space.
Not requiring batteries or a power socket.  (I appreciate that an iPhone or a Nintendo DS for each player might be a good solution more generally, but it's not what I'm after in this case.)
Not being so delicate to arrange that motion from the train will unduly disrupt the play.


I think it would be best to recommend one game (or class of games) per answer, if that's appropriate, and explain why you think it's particularly suitable.  (Incidentally, I've read the guidance on good questions about game recommendations and hope this question meets the criteria.)

Update: Thanks for so many excellent suggestions - we certainly won't be short of games for our next long train journey :)

The problem is with the overrided Twig 404 template. It is overrided in a default way by creating an error404.html.twig under the /app/Resources/TwigBundle/views directory.

The template itself does not contain any irregular or complex logic: just a layout with some translated text (|trans) and a menu with several links.

The problem is, that I can't get app.user object (returned as NULL) or current app.request.locale (always returned as default locale) inside this template.

I have even tried to override the twig exception controller and dump a current locale (Request::getLocale()) or get user - the results are the same - default locale and NULL for user.

Then I decided to dig deeper and found a dozens of listeners (locale listeners, exception liteners, ...) and tried to debug/fix/test there, but I didn't proceed any further.

By the way, I have overrided the 500 error page too, and everything is fine there. Well I guess that when 500 error (exception) is thrown, the symfony has already set up user/locale/etc, because it already has got to the target (controller/action) and other listeners been already executed. But 404 error (NotFoundHttpException) is being thrown BEFORE Symfony targets the action...

I'm interested in their theology, history, and influence on Christianity in their day, and whether or not their influence continues to today.  
",David Stratton,https://christianity.stackexchange.com/users/721,"The “Zwickau prophets,” i.e., Nicholas Storch, Thomas Drechsel, and Mark Stübner, etc., claimed to be prophets of God and to have received revelations directly from God.  They were leading an anti-Protestant, anti-Catholic, spiritualistic attempt at communism and anarchy based on a view of taking the millennium by force as prophets. Thomas Münzer (1490–1525) was a radical figure in the Reformation who became a leader in the Peasants’ Revolt of 1524–1525. From this man we get a clear window into all of his associates:


  Thomas Muenzer, one of the Zwickau Prophets, and an eloquent demagogue, was the apostle and travelling evangelist of the social revolution, and a forerunner of modern socialism, communism, and anarchism. He presents a remarkable compound of the discordant elements of radicalism and mysticism. (HISTORY OF THE CHRISTIAN CHURCH, PHILIP SCHAFF (Vol 7, Ch4, P75)


He started by being influenced by doctrines of the reformation but quickly became an extremist who was deposed from his church. He hated Luther even worse then the Pope even though before his ‘fall’ he was actually selected by Luther to become a Lutheran pastor in the city of Zwickau.


  He was at enmity with the whole existing order of society, and imagined himself the divinely inspired prophet of a new dispensation, a sort of communistic millennium, in which there should be no priests, no princes, no nobles, and no private property, but complete democratic equality. He inflamed the people in fiery harangues from the pulpit, and in printed tracts to open rebellion against their spiritual and secular rulers. He signed himself “Muenzer with the hammer,” and “with the sword of Gideon.” He advised the killing of all the ungodly. They had no right to live. Christ brought the sword, not peace upon earth. “Look not,” he said, “on the sorrow of the ungodly; let not your sword grow cold from blood; strike hard upon the anvil of Nimrod [the princes]; cast his tower to the ground, because the day is yours.” (HISTORY OF THE CHRISTIAN CHURCH, PHILIP SCHAFF (Vol 7, Ch4, P75)


Although it might not seem that these prophets had any influence on the Christian world, Karl Marx did refer to Thomas Münzer in his own writings, so you could say they had an impact on the world's continued opposition to the church. The beliefs of the Zwickau Prophets goes back to a pre-reformation sect in Bohemia who held a, ‘Taborite creed’. Tabor was a city in Bohemia that held control of local gold mines, the citizens joined local peasants to develop a communist-like society.  The key to their quasi-religious communits movement was in their view of the millennial reign of Christ. Taborites lived announced in the millennium there would be no more servants and masters. They promised people would return to a state of pristine innocence.


  Zwickau, however, was near the Bohemian border, and there Müntzer was converted by the weaver and adept Niklas Storch, who had lived in Bohemia, to the old Taborite creed: in particular, continuing personal divine revelation to the prophet of the cult, and the necessity for the Elect to seize power and impose a society of theocratic communism by brutal force of arms. In addition, there was to be communism of women: marriage was to be prohibited, and each man was to be able to have any woman at will.
  Thomas Müntzer now claimed to be the divinely chosen prophet, destined to wage a war of blood and extermination by the Elect against the sinners. Müntzer claimed that the ""living Christ"" had permanently entered his own soul. Endowed thereby with perfect insight into the divine will, he asserted himself to be uniquely qualified to fulfill the divine mission. He even spoke of himself as ""becoming God."" Having graduated from the world of learning, Müntzer was now ready for the world of action. (Karl Marx as Religious Eschatologist, Mises Daily: Friday, October 09, 2009 by Murray N. Rothbard)


Although the influence on communism can be traced, there does not seem to be any lasting influence on Christianity. There is a link between the Bohemian movements and a Christian movement called the Hussites under a Czech reformer Jan Hus (c. 1369–1415) and there are some modern churches who think of themselves to be related to those movements, in particular the Moravian Church, Unity of the Brethren, and the refounded Czechoslovak Hussite churches. However these churches do not resemble the ideas of Thomas Müntzer at all so it seems the lasting impact is more related to the communistic side of things only.

980,980,1551,What is the most secure way to do OCSP signing without creating validation loops?,"I'd like to enable the most secure OCSP validation that Windows 2008 SP1 and newer support.  


Based on the following information, am I required to implement id-pkix-ocsp-nocheck on my OCSP certificate?  
If so, does that mean an OCSP response can be forged, allowing an revoked certificate to go unnoticed by the victim?



  The signature on OCSP responses must follow the following rules to be
  considered valid by a Windows Vista or Windows Server 2008 client:
  
  For Windows Vista, either the OCSP signing certificate must be issued
  by the same CA as the certificate being verified or the OCSP response
  must be signed by the issuing CA. 
  
  For Windows Vista with Service Pack 1 and Windows Server 2008, the
  OCSP signing certificate may chain up to any trusted root CA as long
  as the certificate chain includes the OCSP Signing EKU extension.
  
  CryptoAPI will not support independent OCSP signer during revocation
  checking on this OCSP signing certificate chain to avoid circular
  dependency. CryptoAPI will support CRL and delegated OCSP signer only.
  
  We recommend that you enable the id-pkix-ocsp-nocheck
  (1.3.6.1.5.5.7.48.1.5) extension in the OCSP signing certificate so
  that no revocation checking is performed on the OCSP signing
  certificate. This ensures that a CRL is not downloaded to validate the
  OCSP signing certificate.

To check the revocation status, you must obtain a CRL or an OCSP response; both types of objects are signed, and, before usage, must be validated. Validation of a CRL or an OCSP response entails verifying a signature, relatively to the public key of the object's issuer, public key which is obtained from... validating another certificate chain. The whole process is recursive and you can end up with validating many certificates in the process.

Of course, recursion has potential for loops, and loops are bad.

Consider a simple path: Root -> SubCA -> EE.

You are validating the path, verified all signatures, and reached a point where you also checked that SubCA is not revoked. Now you are considering the EE certificate. The EE certificate contains an AIA extension which points to an OCSP responder; you talk to that responder, and get an OCSP response. Great ! The OCSP response appears to have been signed directly by SubCA, using its private key (the same private key as the one used to sign the EE certificate). This is good: you have already validated that key, including revocation status, so it suffices to check the signature on the OCSP response, and then you can use it (""using"" an OCSP response means looking at its contents and trusting them).

This model above is ""situation 2"" from section 4.2.2.2 of RFC 2560: the certificate used to validate the OCSP response is the same as the certificate of the CA which issued the target certificate (""SubCA"" in our example).

Another model is supposed to be supported, described as ""situation 3"" from section 4.2.2.2: the OCSP response is signed by a dedicated responder, which has a certificate (let's call it ""Resp"") which is issued by SubCA. The Resp certificate is embedded in the OCSP response. How do you validate that ? It is easy enough to check the signatures, and also to check that Resp features the specific EKU which marks delegated OCSP responders. But how do you make sure that the Resp certificate itself was not revoked ?

The three possible ways are:


You use a CRL or another OCSP responder which will give you the information. This, of course, makes the process recursive.
Resp is made to include the specific id-pkix-ocsp-nocheck extension, which makes the Resp certificate ""unrevokable"" (thus you do not need to get its revocation status, since it is unrevoked by definition).
The CA does not care, and includes in Resp an AIA which points to itself as an OCSP responder. Thus, to validate Resp, you must first validate Resp. Face to this chicken-and-egg problem, you weep, then join the CA in its apathy and simply consider that Resp is ""probably fine"".


Unfortunately, I have encountered the third way in big PKI sponsored by huge corporations or sovereign states who really should know better.

Section 4.2.2.2 of RFC 2560 also hints at a ""situation 1"" where the OCSP responder is ""something else"" which the validation engine somehow knows to be safe through some ""local configuration"" (the expression ""local configuration"" is RFC-speak to mean ""by the magic of the Fairies"").

The text you quote means that Windows, up to Vista, knows how to handle situations 2 and 3. From Vista SP1 onwards, it also handles situation 1, with the following twist: the OCSP responder certificate can be ""any certificate"" but CryptoAPI will require CRL to validate that one. This is a drastic way to avoid validation loops.

Summary: if you are building your PKI, the method which will cause the least trouble is to use the CA key for signing OCSP responses. If you really need to use a distinct key (e.g. the CA is supposed to be offline, but the OCSP responder, by nature, is online), then make the CA issue a dedicated certificate for the OCSP responder. This dedicated responder certificate shall contain the id-kp-OCSPSigning EKU and the id-pkix-ocsp-nocheck extension. Since an unrevokable certificate can be viewed as a gross breach of policy, the recommended way is to make it very short-lived: set the responder certificate to be valid for a fortnight or so, and issue a new one very week.

As others have noted, many implementations do not check revocation status for ""extra"" certificates (certificates not in the main chain, but which are used to verify revocation objects like CRL or OCSP responses), which is sloppy but often made necessary (in a commercial way) to cope with big PKI who do not do things properly. It is your moral duty to do better than that (as I expose above) so as to bring us closer to the point where PKI will actually, you know, work and provide security.

Based on the following information, am I required to implement id-pkix-ocsp-nocheck on my OCSP certificate?  
If so, does that mean an OCSP response can be forged, allowing an revoked certificate to go unnoticed by the victim?



  The signature on OCSP responses must follow the following rules to be
  considered valid by a Windows Vista or Windows Server 2008 client:
  
  For Windows Vista, either the OCSP signing certificate must be issued
  by the same CA as the certificate being verified or the OCSP response
  must be signed by the issuing CA. 
  
  For Windows Vista with Service Pack 1 and Windows Server 2008, the
  OCSP signing certificate may chain up to any trusted root CA as long
  as the certificate chain includes the OCSP Signing EKU extension.
  
  CryptoAPI will not support independent OCSP signer during revocation
  checking on this OCSP signing certificate chain to avoid circular
  dependency. CryptoAPI will support CRL and delegated OCSP signer only.
  
  We recommend that you enable the id-pkix-ocsp-nocheck
  (1.3.6.1.5.5.7.48.1.5) extension in the OCSP signing certificate so
  that no revocation checking is performed on the OCSP signing
  certificate. This ensures that a CRL is not downloaded to validate the
  OCSP signing certificate.

558,558,879,Is it appropriate to email an eminent researcher in your field?,"Sometimes, I feel to contact some of the eminent researchers in my field for any of the following reasons:


Appreciating their research publication (recent times). They publish in top conferences, which are usually not hosted in my country or nearby.

Sometimes, to know what they think on some specific research area that has propagated due to there work. (Probably looks like some journalistic work)
For knowing how did they tackle the pressures or certain situation during their PhD or research. (Yes, it's vague but these questions come to mind and probably should be answered by oneself or personal interaction, but adding it for the sake of completion)

280,280,452,"What is the lesser evil, degassing too early or too late?","Suppose that I have made bread dough and it is supposed to be degassed around 90 min after kneading (t+90). Suppose that I have to leave home at t+30 and will be back sometime between t+120 and t+150. 

What is better for the dough, to degas it too early or to degas it too late? I know I can try to influence the duration of the first rising by changing the temperature (I could either put it in the fridge or in an oven preheated to 50°C, turned off and cracked open). But I doubt that the dough's internal temperature will change substantially during these short times. 

So, what is the better strategy? Warm it and degas early, or cool it and degas late? 

For the record, I am talking about a high-hydration bread (86%), with sugar, but no fat, 2.8% yeast. But if the hydration, leanness and yeast amount have an influence on the decision, I would like to hear about that too. (Assume that for any yeast amount, the time period before degassing has been calculated to be correct for it). 
",rumtscho,https://cooking.stackexchange.com/users/4638,"I find it's best to judge by texture and dough volume rather than by rising time, because it's so variable with temperature.  

There is a trade-off for when to degas &amp; shape your bread, and where you draw the line depends on what you're aiming for with that particular batch. If you shape earlier, the loaves are easier to shape, and you get tighter, taller loaves. Shaping later yields a lighter, fluffier, more open crumb. 

The reason this trade-off exists is that the gluten stretches out during the initial rise as it traps gas.  If your first rise is brief, then the dough is more dense and has additional stretch, which aids in getting a good amount of tension on your formed loaf.  The tension in the loaf's skin directs its expansion upward, rather than spreading outward.  

Conversely, when the dough rises further, there is more incorporated gas, and the gluten has less elasticity.  It is more difficult to correctly shape the loaf, but the additional trapped gas bubbles act as nucleation sites to grow into larger air bubbles during the second rise.  This gives a less dense crumb, and may yield additional rising.

Note that all of this is assuming you make free-form loaves, with a rise-shape-proof process.  If you're doing bread-pan loaves, punching down can wait a little later.  For high-gluten flours, you'll want to rise and proof a bit longer, since they can hold more gas.  Sourdoughs need to be shaped earlier because they tend to turn into puddles otherwise.

The problem is that Mathematica can't calculate the last integral for any arbitrary $n$, although it can, correctly, calculate its value for hardcoded $n$s. Like $n=1,2,...$.

My question is:
Do you have any idea on how I could calculate it, perhaps by rewriting it a bit, or by using some other trick? In case it helps, the result should be $n^2\pi^2$.

Note: Actually it can be calculated with Cauchy's residue theorem, but I'd like to avoid taking that route, if possible. Though, if it can't be done otherwise, I will post a solution with residual calculation so that this question has an answer.

Is there a more mathematica-y way to label these plots?

Why does FourierTransform converge while same integral manually written does not?

1140,1140,1786,Cross-Correlation to find the similartity of songs,"I have been working on a problem where I am given two songs which are of the same category but there is a time difference between them. Eg. one song starts at x sec and other song starts at y sec. So my task is to find the x and y.
The length of the two songs can vary but the content of the two songs will remain the same.  

Currently I am using cross-correlation using FFT for finding the offset between them but it is not giving me correct results.  

For making the length of signals same I am zero padding the signal which is shorter in length. 

Can someone guide me what I am doing wrong in this problem ?

I really appreciate your responses.
Thanks

Thanks guys for replying.. 
I am doing in Python and using below algorithm for finding the offset:
1. Using librosa.load function to get the audio signals of both the songs.
2. Then I zero pad the shorter signal from last and make sure it is power of 2.
3. Find the FFT of the two signals using scipy library function of python.(spipy.fftpack.fft)
4. Once I get the fft , I take the cojugate of one of the signals.
5. Elementwise multiplication of the two fft signals
6. Doing ifft of the numpy array of the output signals after multiplication.
7. Finding the peak index of that array.

P.S. The song length can be around 5-6 mins so I am sampling at the rate of 44.1Khz . So you can expect very large sample space.
Also , the bitrate of the two songs can be different.(I am not sure that will effect it or not)

Any idea if I am doing wrong?

5389,5389,8559,Find volume of cask,"I was given the following question:

A wine cask has a radius at the top of $30 cm$ and a radius at the middle of $40 cm$.
The height of the cask is $1m$.
What is the volume of the cask in litres, assuming the shape of the side is parabolic?

I have to come to parabolic function of

$$y = \frac{-1}{250}(x-50)^2+40$$

The derivative of $y$ is:
$$\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{2}{5} - \frac{x}{125}$$

Then I integrate and end up with an expression the length of $\pi$. Am I on the right track?
",Luke Taylor,https://math.stackexchange.com/users/86007,"All lengths should be in the same units, say metres.

Let the radius $r$ of the cask, at height $h$ above the ground have equation $r=ah^2+bh+c$.

When $h=0$ we want $r=\frac{3}{10}$. When $h=\frac{1}{2}$ we want $r=\frac{4}{10}$. When $h=1$ we want $r=\frac{3}{10}$.

Putting these into $r=ah^2+bh+c$ and solving the three simultaneous equations in $a,b,c$ gives
$$r = \frac{3}{10}+\frac{2}{5}h-\frac{2}{5}h^2$$

773,773,1222,Is it ethical to profit by having my students buy my textbook?,"This question was suggested to me by How can I sell my text book to my students in e-book format? which asked about the practicalities, but attracted many comments about the ethics.  So this question is to ask about the ethics directly.

Suppose I have written and published a textbook, and I want to use it as the text for a course I am teaching.  I receive royalties from each copy of my book that is sold, so if my students are required to buy my textbook for the course, I will make some money.  Is it ethical to do so?

Well-reasoned opinions would be useful answers, but even more useful would be pointers to institutional policies, professional codes of ethics, etc, that address this issue.

Of course, there are many ways to avoid profiting from the sale of my book to my students.  If my contract with my publisher allows it, I could distribute PDFs to my students, or have the university bookstore print out copies and sell them at cost.  Another approach I've heard of is to compute how much I earn in royalties on each copy, and refund that amount from my pocket to each student who buys a copy.  Or, use my royalty earnings to buy pizza for the class.  Certainly these are nice gestures, but I would like opinions on whether they are ethically required.

Edit: To address some questions that have arisen in the comments:


This question is hypothetical.  I haven't published any textbooks myself and have no immediate plans to do so.  In any case, my personal preference would be to make the book available to students for free, if at all possible.  So I've phrased this question in the first person for rhetorical convenience only.
I had intended the question to be only about the potential financial conflict of interest that could arise if I make money by assigning my own book.  Some of the answers feel that it is improper for me to assign my own textbook at all, whether I make money or not, but I don't think this point of view is prevalent within the academic community.  If it happens that my book (as a pithy but now-deleted comment put it) ""blows"", I think most would agree that my decision to assign it is pedagogically unfortunate, but not unethical.  
I don't literally mean that students would be required to buy the book, only that they'd be expected to have it.  I might assign readings or homework problems from the book, so that the student needs access to the book in order to do them, but they could certainly achieve this by getting a used copy or borrowing from a friend.  But probably most students would buy new copies anyway, since that is the most convenient way.

",Nate Eldredge,https://academia.stackexchange.com/users/1010,"This is an interesting question but it involves much more than just ethics and financial considerations. It is also a matter of tradition versus more modern thinking about free material.

I am currently writing a custom ""book"" (not to be published anytime soon) for a new course since no existing book will fit. It will be free of charge, as developmental material, until it becomes published (which will happen if I think it is any good in the end). My old advisor used his lecture notes developed over years to produce a commercial book that can be used by many but is tailored to his (in this case) course. To write materials for your own course or on your research field is quite natural. For obvious reasons such books will suit their purpose best.

I think many would dream of having tailored reading materials in their courses; few have the opportunity to spend the time writing it. In many, if not most, university systems no-one will pay you for writing it so it will be done on your free time. Such books benefit the students by covering more or less exactly what the course is about. As teachers, we have probably been involved in (endless) discussions about the pros and cons of books: ""this covers this material, that book covers that, but not none is perfect. So which one to chose."". The small amount of royalty from own students is not enough to make anyone rich. From this perspective, and assuming the book (and the course) is any good, I think making the issue a matter of ethics is petty. 

The choice is obviously to provide a book material as, for example, free pdf material or try to have it printed (which is expensive) as a regular book or as print on demand. If one want others to use the material, publishing a book puts the material ""on the map"". A book also carries with it prestige, not only for the author but for the department and the university. It may also signal to the student that the teacher is a ""name"" in the field. So there are many reasons for choosing a book but not many will first look at it as a source for revenue.

So in the end, I cannot see anything wrong with using a book and receiving royalty as long as the book is good, the course is good, so that the students get the best opportunity to learn the material the course should provide.

This question is hypothetical.  I haven't published any textbooks myself and have no immediate plans to do so.  In any case, my personal preference would be to make the book available to students for free, if at all possible.  So I've phrased this question in the first person for rhetorical convenience only.
I had intended the question to be only about the potential financial conflict of interest that could arise if I make money by assigning my own book.  Some of the answers feel that it is improper for me to assign my own textbook at all, whether I make money or not, but I don't think this point of view is prevalent within the academic community.  If it happens that my book (as a pithy but now-deleted comment put it) ""blows"", I think most would agree that my decision to assign it is pedagogically unfortunate, but not unethical.  
I don't literally mean that students would be required to buy the book, only that they'd be expected to have it.  I might assign readings or homework problems from the book, so that the student needs access to the book in order to do them, but they could certainly achieve this by getting a used copy or borrowing from a friend.  But probably most students would buy new copies anyway, since that is the most convenient way.

","This is an interesting question but it involves much more than just ethics and financial considerations. It is also a matter of tradition versus more modern thinking about free material.

I am currently writing a custom ""book"" (not to be published anytime soon) for a new course since no existing book will fit. It will be free of charge, as developmental material, until it becomes published (which will happen if I think it is any good in the end). My old advisor used his lecture notes developed over years to produce a commercial book that can be used by many but is tailored to his (in this case) course. To write materials for your own course or on your research field is quite natural. For obvious reasons such books will suit their purpose best.

I think many would dream of having tailored reading materials in their courses; few have the opportunity to spend the time writing it. In many, if not most, university systems no-one will pay you for writing it so it will be done on your free time. Such books benefit the students by covering more or less exactly what the course is about. As teachers, we have probably been involved in (endless) discussions about the pros and cons of books: ""this covers this material, that book covers that, but not none is perfect. So which one to chose."". The small amount of royalty from own students is not enough to make anyone rich. From this perspective, and assuming the book (and the course) is any good, I think making the issue a matter of ethics is petty. 

The choice is obviously to provide a book material as, for example, free pdf material or try to have it printed (which is expensive) as a regular book or as print on demand. If one want others to use the material, publishing a book puts the material ""on the map"". A book also carries with it prestige, not only for the author but for the department and the university. It may also signal to the student that the teacher is a ""name"" in the field. So there are many reasons for choosing a book but not many will first look at it as a source for revenue.

So in the end, I cannot see anything wrong with using a book and receiving royalty as long as the book is good, the course is good, so that the students get the best opportunity to learn the material the course should provide.

3460,3460,5511,How do I attach a GPS receiver?,"I would like to hookup a GPS receiver to my Pi so that I can:


Get my geographical position 
Synchronise clock when not connected to network


What are my options? Will any hardware supported by gpsd work with the Pi?
",Maria Zverina,https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/users/188,"GPS Receiver

I would go for a generic usb GPS receiver such as the BU-353



It works with the Raspberry Pi, just like a normal linux computer. 

Most usb GPS receivers are just USB-to-Serial adapters that read the NMEA data from the GPS receiver. Look into pl2303 (many units i've seen use this particular chip) drivers, should be available. 

You can also use GPIO and a traditional NMEA 0183 GPS receiver, but then you need to worry about power, and the prices are often higher. GPS antannas are common onboard boats and ships, and usually consume 12v.

The usb solution is cheaper.

Software

The gps receiver I mentioned is compatible with gpsd.

sudo apt-get install gpsd gpsd-clients python-gps


This will install gpsd and related software. Check gps status with cgps -s.

NTP Clock

Get my geographical position 
Synchronise clock when not connected to network


What are my options? Will any hardware supported by gpsd work with the Pi?
","GPS Receiver

I would go for a generic usb GPS receiver such as the BU-353



It works with the Raspberry Pi, just like a normal linux computer. 

Most usb GPS receivers are just USB-to-Serial adapters that read the NMEA data from the GPS receiver. Look into pl2303 (many units i've seen use this particular chip) drivers, should be available. 

You can also use GPIO and a traditional NMEA 0183 GPS receiver, but then you need to worry about power, and the prices are often higher. GPS antannas are common onboard boats and ships, and usually consume 12v.

The usb solution is cheaper.

Software

The gps receiver I mentioned is compatible with gpsd.

sudo apt-get install gpsd gpsd-clients python-gps


This will install gpsd and related software. Check gps status with cgps -s.

NTP Clock

To synchronize the clock with NTP, you need to install ntp.

sudo apt-get install ntp

1835,1835,2913,Red flags of unpaid IT internship,"I read the following question: Tips for a first year CS student looking for a summer internship to gain experience?
But rather than how to get and/or look for internships, my questions concerns of how to filter companies looking for free labor to do their website VS companies that might not offer a paid check, but it will offer you mentorship and skills.

I have a cousin that is a college freshman and she is looking for Sofware development internships, but at this point, she is desperately looking for any internship that is IT related. Besides the big software names and elite small software shops, How do you recognize a good internships in non-it-companies(large or small) doing IT maintenance vs the bad ones? If you don't have work experience, what questions a college student should ask to prevent ripoff? Are there any red flags that you can spot before accepting an offer?
",Armando,https://programmers.stackexchange.com/users/24962,"Fair warning - in my opinion, her biggest detriment is years of college experience.  While it's quite true that you can be a great programmer and be a college freshman - big companies with established internship programs that offer the kind of things you are speaking of typically have a set of hardened criteria for reviewing applicants.  One of them is years of college experience and most companies don't readily accept interns that are freshman - the earliest is usually after Sophomore year.

This is partially because interns - even if they are free - are an investment.  They need computers, space to work, and the time of a senior person to supervise them.  The cost of this has to be weighed against the value the intern will bring to the team.  IMO - most interns are a good deal, but you can't take everyone so a company has to find some set of criteria.

So, knowing your cousin is a freshman tells me that if she wants a technical internship, she's already going to have to get creative - it's time to start using every under-the-wire resource and personal connection.  You'll want to maximize your contact with people who will see working with her as a plus - and that's a heck of a lot easier with people who know your cousin.

The other venue that is ALWAYS worth maximizing is her college's internship system.  Most colleges have internal internship job boards where the college and the internship providers have worked together to build a set of opportunities for students.  In these cases, the companies realize that they need to give interns a good opportunity.

I'm assuming that at this point, though, your cousin has tried everything and she's really scrounging - going to just about every job board and trying just about every opportunity.  Assuming she gets an interview, she'll want to remember that interviewing is as much about checking out the company as it is about showing potential.  Here's some things I'd look for when going on an internship interview (now that I'm well past my intern years and I know from the other side exactly what a manager can do with an intern!).  I'm keeping it broad as IT is a heck of a lot more than just software work!


What will I be working on? - good signs are work that involve either making things work or verifying that they are working.  Bad signs are doing paperwork while other people make things work.  Having to service customer problems (front line tech support) isn't all bad, it may all she can snag, but if that's the case, she should be getting paid.
Who will I be working for?  - preferably it's someone on the interview list or someone on the interview list is ""sample manager"" - ie a manager who needs interns, but the company may assign the candidate to a similar but different manager in the end - it's just that managers have to handle pools of interviews and often matchmaking is done later on.  Ask this manager what they expect from an intern and what they are willing to give.  Good signs are ""I expect you to take responsibility"", ""I expect you to ask lots of questions"", ""I expect you'll keep me appraised of your status"", ""I expect that by the end of the internship you'll be able to take on a 3-4 week chunk of work and work with minimal assistance"".  Bad signs are - ""you'll follow me around and do exactly what I tell you"", or ""I won't have time to give much guidance, and I don't have anyone that can help, we'll have to figure it out as we go"".
How big is the technical team? - hopefully it's a team of 5-10 people with varying degrees of expertise, with at least a few senior people.  Also - how much time will the senior people have to spare to answer questions?  Good = 15 minutes a day, with a known rampup of longer than that early on.  Bad = ""what senior people?""  or ""it's just you"".
What are the major goals of the team?  What are the key ingredients to success on this project?  - this is my particular way (when I do volunteer work) of figuring out whether I've found people I can work with.  If it takes 20 minutes to answer this question, we have a failure.  Even if I am working alone, with a non-technical person, I may learn a lot of good stuff.  But that requires that the people I'm working with have a real clue of what they want to get done.  It's amazing how many people really don't know what the problem they are trying to solve is, or what qualifies as a solution.  Without that core vision, no matter how technical the team is, it's likely that the internship will be frustrating.


All that said - seriously - don't feel awful if an internship doesn't happen in the summer of Freshman year.  I had pretty great grades, 3 languages under my belt and a programmer mother and I STILL didn't swing an internship my Freshman summer.

5709,5709,9048,"When turning a corner my rear wheel touches the brake pad, is this normal?","I replaced my brake pads about a week ago and today I noticed that, when turning (or generally under lateral force), the rim touches one of the brake pads (depending on which way I'm turning.

I hadn't noticed it before but today was the first wet day so maybe the sound was louder because of this.

I don't notice myself slowing down at all, but don't really want to be unnecessarily wearing down my brakes.

The brakes aren't super close when released, maybe 2-3mm on each side.

I would expect a certain amount of flex in the wheel, but as I built the wheel myself I just wanted to check that this wasn't a problem with my build (though its already done 1000 miles probably so it cant be too bad!)

There would be room to widen the brakes slightly if this is all that might be required.

When stationary and holding the wheel and applying lateral force manually I can make the rim touch either brake pad without a great deal of effort.

Any input appreciated

935,935,1485,"Good travel games for two players, especially for playing on trains?","I would be interested to hear if anyone had recommendations for 2-player games that are particularly suitable for playing while travelling on trains.  (I ask this as someone who mostly enjoys games like Carcassonne, Power Grid, Agricola, Pandemic, etc. around the table at home.)  To be specific, the things that I think are important properties for these games are:


Needing minimal table space.  Most trains have a small table you could use, but not much more.
Being quiet to play, so that other passengers won't be disturbed.  For example, I imagine that games that involve repeatedly rolling dice wouldn't be appreciated.
Packing down small, so that they don't take up much luggage space.
Not requiring batteries or a power socket.  (I appreciate that an iPhone or a Nintendo DS for each player might be a good solution more generally, but it's not what I'm after in this case.)
Not being so delicate to arrange that motion from the train will unduly disrupt the play.


I think it would be best to recommend one game (or class of games) per answer, if that's appropriate, and explain why you think it's particularly suitable.  (Incidentally, I've read the guidance on good questions about game recommendations and hope this question meets the criteria.)

Update: Thanks for so many excellent suggestions - we certainly won't be short of games for our next long train journey :)

Basically, my lecturer has told me that we have a project due next semester that involves us to use Java and SQL intertwined with each other.

I had no idea the combining of languages was even possible!

So my mind's really blown.

I've been searching around looking for examples of such code but no luck. So I thought I'd ask you guys.

I think the most logical thing to do since I have no experience with combining would be too create tables in SQL due too its use in databases and call them through Java.

Can anyone explain to me how this is possible or just the jist of how languages combine.
","What you will probably be doing is using JDBC to allow Java to connect to SQL databases. There are also persistence layers, such as Hibernate, that you can use to store and retrieve data in a database using Java.

1487,1487,2338,"Does following ""musical forms"" suppress ""creativity""?","I'm not a professional musician (actually, I'm a computer programmer), but I'm playing Guitar and Recorder, and I also sometimes write some themes coming to my mind.

Thus, let's assume that I'm a little novice composer. Now, when a theme comes to my mind (or a simple motif), I start developing it, based on my intuition, and based on my sensational analysis. I only extend it, the way it sounds good to me. In other words, I don't follow any kind of musical form to extend (I can't find a better word for it) my theme into a more complete piece. 

On the other hand, when I give the extended song to my close friends, or my wife, or people close to me, they might like it, only based on its aesthetic value, not based on its musical and technical analysis. In other words, they say like ""oh, it's beautiful"".

However, when I try to put my song in a musical form, and to my opinion, make a highly technical piece, I feel that it looses its beauty (of course, IMO), and people around me say ""the way before it was more beautiful"". 

Now, I have a question. Should we follow musical forms? Why we have to confine ourselves to musical form at all? Isn't it true that we only create music, because of its aesthetic value? Does following form suppresses creativity in art, which in turn suppresses beauty and ingenuity of our work of arts?
",Saeed Neamati,https://music.stackexchange.com/users/925,"If you're not following any existing form, it becomes encumbant on you to construct the form anew. Without form, you'll have real difficulty making the song listenable beyond a certain length. It's the same with programming. Beyond a few thousand lines, the lack of structure makes the entire enterprise unweildy.

So it is very useful to learn how to follow this or that form, so you can steal little bits of structure.

Eg. I had a little guitar riff that was very catchy. You could speed it up, slow it down, add drones, lead lines. But I could not, for the life of me, make it go anywhere.

Thus, let's assume that I'm a little novice composer. Now, when a theme comes to my mind (or a simple motif), I start developing it, based on my intuition, and based on my sensational analysis. I only extend it, the way it sounds good to me. In other words, I don't follow any kind of musical form to extend (I can't find a better word for it) my theme into a more complete piece. 

On the other hand, when I give the extended song to my close friends, or my wife, or people close to me, they might like it, only based on its aesthetic value, not based on its musical and technical analysis. In other words, they say like ""oh, it's beautiful"".

However, when I try to put my song in a musical form, and to my opinion, make a highly technical piece, I feel that it looses its beauty (of course, IMO), and people around me say ""the way before it was more beautiful"". 

Now, I have a question. Should we follow musical forms? Why we have to confine ourselves to musical form at all? Isn't it true that we only create music, because of its aesthetic value? Does following form suppresses creativity in art, which in turn suppresses beauty and ingenuity of our work of arts?
","If you're not following any existing form, it becomes encumbant on you to construct the form anew. Without form, you'll have real difficulty making the song listenable beyond a certain length. It's the same with programming. Beyond a few thousand lines, the lack of structure makes the entire enterprise unweildy.

So it is very useful to learn how to follow this or that form, so you can steal little bits of structure.

Eg. I had a little guitar riff that was very catchy. You could speed it up, slow it down, add drones, lead lines. But I could not, for the life of me, make it go anywhere. When I finally began to wonder why, theory showed the way. The riff was essentially a 2-measure chord progression: I / / / | V / / /. I couldn't start a new phrase (bridge/chorus/anything ""different but the same"") on V because I was already there. So I had to steal pieces from other forms: deceptive cadence or ""sitting"" on I the last time round (of some binary repetitions) [this one actually makes the ""new phrase on V"" possible].

1364,1364,2146,A helical cycloid?,"While combing around my notes looking for other possible examples for this question, I chanced upon another one of my unsolved problems:

Cycloidal curves are curves generated by a circle rolling upon a plane or space curve. It's not too hard to derive the required parametric equations if the fixed curve is a plane curve, but I've had some trouble deriving the corresponding expression for space curves.

More specifically, here is the particular problem I was concerned with: consider a (cylindrical) helix:

$$\begin{align*}x&amp;=a\cos\;t\\y&amp;=a\sin\;t\\z&amp;=ct\end{align*}$$

and imagine a circle of radius $r$ whose plane is always perpendicular to the x-y plane rolling on the helix, starting at the point $(a,0,0)$ ($t=0$). Imagine a point in the plane of the circle at a distance $hr$ from the center. What are the parametric equations for the locus of the point?

The two obvious pieces of information I have are that the center of the circle also traces a helix, whose parametric equation differs from the original by a vertical shift of $r$ (per Tony, that was an erroneous assumption), and that the expression for the arclength of the helix, $s=\sqrt{a^2+c^2}t$, should figure into the final parametric equations. Otherwise, I'm not sure how to start.

How does one derive parametric equations for the ""helical cycloid""?



The physical model I had in mind was a screw ramp winding around a cylinder. Supposing that there was a car that needed to go to the top of the cylinder by driving on the ramp, and supposing that a spot is placed on one of the car's wheels, what are the equations for the locus of the spot?
",J. M. is not a mathematician,https://math.stackexchange.com/users/498,"I'm adjusting my answer, which as TonyK points out was based on an incorrect assumption.  Hopefully it's correct now.

The center of the circle is not directly above the point of contact with the helix as my incorrect answer had asserted.  To see where it is, first picture the starting point at $(a,0,0)$, where the circle is parallel to the $y$-$z$ plane.  The tangent vector to the helix is in the direction of $(0,a,c)$, so the radius is perpendicular to this in the direction of $(0,-c,a)$.  So you have to add $\frac{r}{\sqrt{a^2+c^2}}(0,-c,a)$ to get to the center.  As the circle rolls along, the vector you add to get to the center will rotate around the $z$ axis to $\frac{r}{\sqrt{a^2+c^2}}(c\sin(t),-c\cos(t),a)$.  So the center of the circle is parametrized by $(a\cos(t),a\sin(t),ct)+\frac{r}{\sqrt{a^2+c^2}}(c\sin(t),-c\cos(t),a)$.

The arclength formula allows you to write down the rotation angle of the point about the center of the circle in terms of $t$ as $\frac{\sqrt{a^2+c^2}}{r}t$.  Let $b=\frac{\sqrt{a^2+c^2}}{r}$ from now on. 

If we pretend for a minute that the point was just going to rotate about the center of the circle at this rate while the circle remains fixed, and simplify the problem for now by assuming that the point starts above the center of the circle, then the vector we would add to the center of the circle to parametrize the point would be $(0,hr\sin(bt),hr\cos(bt))$.  When looking toward the $y$-$z$ plane from the positive $x$ axis, this motion would appear clockwise, as it should because the circle will be starting off to the right from this perspective.

But the vector we actually add to the center will also be rotated by $t$ about the $z$-axis, so putting it all together (with minimal simplification) we get 

$\begin{align*}
x&amp;=a\cos(t)+\frac{c}{b}\sin(t)-hr\sin(t)\sin(bt)\\
y&amp;=a\sin(t)-\frac{c}{b}\cos(t)+hr\cos(t)\sin(bt)\\
z&amp;=ct+\frac{a}{b}+hr\cos(bt).

Now to adjust the starting point, you can change $bt$ to $b(t-t_0)$ for suitable $t_0$.

Solution.  One of our seldomly used SPROCs had an error with an insert (number of columns didn't match), but we are still confused on what exactly was happening.

When looking at all the trace information, the EXEC statement for this SPROC was listed at times, but NEVER just before the BLOCK happened on the blockking SPID.  It seemed that when it starting blocking, the trace didn't record the execution of it (or any of the statements within it either).  However there are other times were the trace did record it's execution and no blocking occurred.

The SPROC error report came from a user, and I was able to find multiple EXEC statements in traces and run them in SSMS.  No time when I ran them did we have any blocking occur or did they hang.  They ran as expected (the catch block fired and rolled back the transaction after the error).  After resolving the fixing the SPROC, we have not seen the issue again.

",Ian,https://photo.stackexchange.com/users/623,"The gyroscope in an iPhone doesn't actually let you track the direction the camera was facing at the time of a shot. All it does it track motion--it has no frame of reference to determine what point of the compass the camera is actually facing.

The ""digital compass"" in the iPhone 3G S onwards can give some idea of that, except that it's designed to be used when the iPhone is more or less flat.

Am I right to assume that there is a standard way to “tag” an image with the direction the camera was pointing in, as well as the GPS position?

Do any cameras have positional tracking better then a GPS?

I am thinking about a method to join photos when the subject does not have enough “random” detail for the current software.
","The gyroscope in an iPhone doesn't actually let you track the direction the camera was facing at the time of a shot. All it does it track motion--it has no frame of reference to determine what point of the compass the camera is actually facing.

The ""digital compass"" in the iPhone 3G S onwards can give some idea of that, except that it's designed to be used when the iPhone is more or less flat. It would thus require a mirror to be fitted to the camera lens to be useful, and in any case compass data isn't included in the EXIF info. I would expect that any camera providing directional capabilities would be using an equivalent ""digital compass"" using a magnetometer.

5023,5023,7999,Where is my power going?,"We just got an overly large (several hundred dollars over normal) electric bill from the city.

Being a bit of a diy I picked up an ammeter to to track down the reason. None of my circuits are clocking in over 2 amps in normal usage. I tried powering up everything in the house including all of the major appliances. 

I only came up with a total of 22 amps, absolute max draw. US standard 110V.

I did the math but I wasn't able to crack our normal $150 / month (calculated out using the local kilowatt hour pricing).

What the heck is going on? Anything more for me to do before calling the electrician?

Edit:

The meter box is mounted to the side of the house, under a overhang.

When I used the ammeter I was working off the main hot line from the meter when I powered everything up. 

I did see the other diy post. 

We do have central air, howeverit was a lot cooler last month vs the same time last year. The usage shouldnt have spiked, at least that much.

The price per killowatt hour is comperable to last year as well.

We generally clock in at around 1200 to 1800 kilowatt hours. Last month was a bit over 2800.

We already tried (unsuccessfully) to lodge a complaint with the electric company.

The odd thing is the variance -$150 one month and near $1000 the next, with no noticible change in utilization patterns.

[EDIT - 06/29/2012]

I believe you have your PHP OOP logic incorrect, but I could be wrong. You're defining a property in a child class which extends a parent class. You then call the parent constructor inside the child constructor. 

The code you provided shows that you assign the child class property $plugin_basename, but then you don't do anything with it after that.

I'm assuming you're trying to set a property $plugin_basename for the parent class to handle. However, if that's the case, then you need to either define the property within the parent class, OR you need to call the parent method which makes use the property $plugin_basename. 

If that's NOT the case, then you need to be sure you make use of the property $plugin_basename, within the child class, AFTER it's been assigned like so: $this-&gt;child_class_method_name($this-&gt;plugin_basename);

You could access the parent class method which handles the property $plugin_basename, and pass the property assigned by the child class to the parent class method like so: $this-&gt;parent_class_method_name($this-&gt;plugin_basename);

I'm not really too certain how you have your plugin setup, given the minimal amount of code you provided. 

If you could provide more of an idea of what you do with the property $plugin_basename, after it's been assigned, I could possibly be of more assistance.

526,526,829,What does the Result property of a windows message mean and when and how to use it?,"Result property meaning:


  Specifies the value that is returned to window in response to handling
  the message


But MSDN does not says anymore:
http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.forms.message.result%28v=vs.110%29.aspx

I will remark this quote words from the user @Idle_Mind in this question Trying to write a better WndProc Handling:


  You can set the Result() property to change the way the message is
  handled.


It is just like a winapi function return success value? Zero = true and non-zero = false, or what is?

Someone could explain me really what means the value of that propertie, in which circunstances I should need to use this value, and show me a code example of how I can use it handling messages from a wndproc sub?


  UPDATE:


Example of how I'm trying to handle WM_CREATE message...

Protected Overrides Sub WndProc(ByRef m As Message)

    Select Case m.Msg

        Case &amp;H1 ' WM_CREATE
             m.Result = -1

    End Select

    MyBase.WndProc(m)

End Sub

",ElektroStudios,https://stackoverflow.com/users/1248295,"Every window message (WM_CREATE, WM_DESTROY, WM_PAINT, WM_USER, etc, etc) is sent by something. Most message are sent by Windows in response to some user interaction or some API call. Others are sent by 3rd-party code (for example, when you call the Win32 API SendMessage, it's the caller of SendMessage that is directly sending the message). In any case, the sender of the message probably expects something in response. The expected response depends on the sender of the message and the message type.

In most cases, you'll probably want to follow the rules defined by Microsoft for the window message. For example, in the documentation for WM_CREATE, it says:

But MSDN does not says anymore:
http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.forms.message.result%28v=vs.110%29.aspx

I will remark this quote words from the user @Idle_Mind in this question Trying to write a better WndProc Handling:


  You can set the Result() property to change the way the message is
  handled.


It is just like a winapi function return success value? Zero = true and non-zero = false, or what is?

Someone could explain me really what means the value of that propertie, in which circunstances I should need to use this value, and show me a code example of how I can use it handling messages from a wndproc sub?


  UPDATE:


Example of how I'm trying to handle WM_CREATE message...

Protected Overrides Sub WndProc(ByRef m As Message)

    Select Case m.Msg

        Case &amp;H1 ' WM_CREATE
             m.Result = -1

    End Select

    MyBase.WndProc(m)

End Sub

","Every window message (WM_CREATE, WM_DESTROY, WM_PAINT, WM_USER, etc, etc) is sent by something. Most message are sent by Windows in response to some user interaction or some API call. Others are sent by 3rd-party code (for example, when you call the Win32 API SendMessage, it's the caller of SendMessage that is directly sending the message). In any case, the sender of the message probably expects something in response. The expected response depends on the sender of the message and the message type.

In most cases, you'll probably want to follow the rules defined by Microsoft for the window message. For example, in the documentation for WM_CREATE, it says:


  If an application processes this message, it should return zero to continue creation of the window. If the application returns –1, the window is destroyed and the CreateWindowEx or CreateWindow function returns a NULL handle.


When handling WM_CREATE messages, you should return the appropriate value as defined above. When handling other messages, you should return whatever the documentation says about that message. When handing a 3rd-party message such as WM_USER, the 3rd-party should clearly indicate what it expects.

  Programmatically Create XML File From XSD  
  XML instance generation from XML schema (xsd)
  How to generate sample XML documents from their DTD or XSD?
  




Here's the scenario: I've created an application that hooks into a commercial CRM product using their web service API, which unfortunately has a different schema for every installation, based on how the users create their custom fields. This schema can also be modified at any time. This application will be installed at the customer location, and will need to function even when they change their field structure.

In order to insert or update a record, I first call their Project.GetSchema() method, which returns the XSD file based on the current set of fields, and then I can call the Project.AddProject() method, passing in an XML file containing the project data.

My question is: What's the best way to generate the XML from the XSD file at runtime? I need to be able to check for the existence of fields, and fill them out only if they exist (for instance, if the customer deleted or renamed some fields). 

I really don't want to have the application attempting to recompile classes on the fly using xsd.exe. There simply must be a better way.

[update] My current solution, that I'm working on, is to basically parse out the XSD file myself, since the majority of the schema is going to be the same for each installation. It's just an ugly solution, and I was hoping there was a better way. The biggest problem I have is that their schema uses xsd:sequence, so putting things in a different order always breaks validation.

  How to generate sample XML documents from their DTD or XSD?
  




Here's the scenario: I've created an application that hooks into a commercial CRM product using their web service API, which unfortunately has a different schema for every installation, based on how the users create their custom fields. This schema can also be modified at any time. This application will be installed at the customer location, and will need to function even when they change their field structure.

In order to insert or update a record, I first call their Project.GetSchema() method, which returns the XSD file based on the current set of fields, and then I can call the Project.AddProject() method, passing in an XML file containing the project data.

My question is: What's the best way to generate the XML from the XSD file at runtime? I need to be able to check for the existence of fields, and fill them out only if they exist (for instance, if the customer deleted or renamed some fields). 

I really don't want to have the application attempting to recompile classes on the fly using xsd.exe. There simply must be a better way.

[update] My current solution, that I'm working on, is to basically parse out the XSD file myself, since the majority of the schema is going to be the same for each installation. It's just an ugly solution, and I was hoping there was a better way. The biggest problem I have is that their schema uses xsd:sequence, so putting things in a different order always breaks validation.

74,74,117,"Diff between backups: see permissions, group and owner and sym link differences","Question

Using only the command line, is it possible to tell if a rsync backup (on a NAS) and the original folder tree (on a web server) are exactly the same? I mean in terms of file sizes, attributes, and symbolic links?

I feat the most for symbolic links. In case of a hard-drive failure – let's say I can solve all the booting issues – will I be able to put back all the files with all the symbolic links done right and their permissions / attributes?

Context
I am setting up an rsync backup system in which my NAS (arm processor) connects to my dedicated webserver hosted far far away and does a backup of the / partition. 

In case of a disk crash, I plan on making the exact same partition setup on the new disk, on installing the same operating system (14.04) so I get the MBR / boot loader in place. 

Then I will rsync back the backup from the NAS to the server, reboot and cross my fingers.

The issue is that I will only know if everything works the day I need the backup…. But I can take measures to know if it will work before. One of them is checking that every single file, folder, sym link… in the backup has the same permissions, attributes, whatever than the original. I also need to check that the sym links and similar are correctly done.

The options I use with rsync are :

rsync -rlptgoDXvxzH --numeric-ids --exclude={""/dev/*"",""/proc/*"",""/sys/*"",""/tmp/*"",""/run/*"",""/mnt/*"",""/media/*"",""/lost+found""}


The option A is causing issues.

EDIT: ADDITIONAL INFO

What I am looking for is a working backup strategy that will allow me:

– to perform blazing fast backups.
Because I do backup the / system partition, I take most services down on the server (apache, postfix, dovecot, mysql, etc.) so I can have a safe backup. Any solution such as rsync is good, because I can update a mirror directory on the NAS. Then, offline, I can take care of the backup strategy (incremental, etc…) from the updated mirror.

– to have fast restore (I don't want to transfer a 100 GB disk image).
I have a really really fast connection between the NAS and the server. I mean really fast. Transferring a 10 GB disk image is a matter of minutes.

What I can't do: change the physical setup of the hosted server. I have one 500 GB disk. That's all.

What I can do: boot the server in a rescue mode in which the disk isn't mounted at all. Rescue mode even works with a dead disk. I use this mode to perform binary images of partitions.

Setup


At first I created an Ext4 Partition on my PC using gparted.

Then I booted into a small Arch GNU/Linux installation in the hope that this would bring a better performance. Then I attached my Raspberry Pi with a only a bit modified Raspbian GNU/Linux Installation via Ethernet switch to the PC.

Then I mounted the Ext4 partition. 


Copying


After this I copied the / partition of the Pi to my PC.

rsync -rlptgoDXvxzH --numeric-ids --exclude={""/dev/*"",""/proc/*"",""/sys/*"",""/tmp/*"",""/run/*"",""/mnt/*"",""/media/*"",""/lost+found""} root@raspberrypi:/ rsync_mount/


This took about 20 minutes. If you copy your server to your NAS you may need

bricking the Raspberry Pi



Then I bricked my Raspberry Pi using

rm -r /run /var /etc /usr


Then I had to unplug the power cable because nothing was working anymore.

Finally I plugged the SD-Card of the Rpi into my computer, mounted it and repaired it using

cp -rpvxH  rsync_mount/* rpi_mount/


after unmounting the SD-Card and booting the Rpi everything worked fine again.

Fazit

The part with rsync worked fine, but I do not know if it will work with a complete new installation. Maybe then the kernel will not fit to what you copy back on the server.

I will make another try, where I install a newer kernel version after rsyncing.

The files are split up into about 75,000 directories.
99% of the daily change comes from adding new directories; existing files are rarely changed.


There's some other relevant discussion here.
","I've had great luck with Doubletake, despite the price. Their ""move"" product might fit the budget though...

See my answer to a similar question here.

Don't flag a comment for moderator attention to correct a typo unless the issue is so serious that it needs to be fixed.  Moderators have enough flags to handle, so they don't need a whole host of new ones asking them to capitalize ""i"" in thousands of comments.

256,256,413,How to find bible verses?,"This is a question one of my Catechism students asked.  We were playing a Bible based board game where if you don't know the answer you look it up in the Bible.  That's pretty great, if you know how to find verses in the Bible.  

But, given a standard super thick, thin paged Bible with no tabs and characteristically ignoring the index page like one would expect an eighth grader might, what mnemonic and memorization devices do people use to find the relative position of certain books in the Bible?

(I'd prefer Catholic answers using Catholic Bibles, but any wisdom is appreciated)
",Peter Turner,https://christianity.stackexchange.com/users/4,"I learned this technique on Protestant Bibles but you could easily adapt it for any Bible. It works best if you have everyone use their own Bible so that they can see how the technique applies to the Bible they use most.


Psalms is usually at the center of most Bibles. If you're looking for Psalms you try to open to the middle of the book.
The New Testament tends to start around the last quarter of the Bible.
So let's say you're looking for John 3:16.

It's in the New Testament so it's in the last quarter of the Bible.
It's a Gospel so it's at the front of that last quarter.
Flip to about the last quarter of the book. If you land on John great.
If you landed somewhere else is it before or after John?



This also goes hand in hand with memorizing the order of the books which the best I can do is a song that I think I might still have somewhere on VHS but you can just hit up YouTube and find something your kids will like.

Even more helpful is understanding the sections of the Bible.


Law
History
Poetry &amp; Wisdom
Major Prophets
Minor Prophets
Gospels
Pauline Epistles
General Epistles
Prophecy


So from the example above, if the open the Bible to somewhere other than John it goes:


What book are you on?
Is it before or after John?


Is it Old Testament or New? If it's old you move back. New could be either way.
What section is it in? If it's a Gospel, which one? (in this case any one means move back slowly)
If it's not at least one of the minor prophets then you're probably way too far ahead.
Likewise if you landed in Revelation then you're too far back. (This actually happens because of maps and other stuff they cram into Bibles these days.)



It plays out like a game of 20 questions. Every time you move you repeat the steps. I don't remember it taking long for us to pick this up but, the more time they spend using an actual Bible with no search aids, the faster they'll get it.

""What age are you?"" is definitely not idiomatic.  Using it would mark you instantly as a non-native speaker.  However, it makes logical sense and it would be understood.

""How age is it?"" would be even worse.  While most native speakers could likely figure out what this meant, it sounds simply wrong.

If you were asking a person about his or her age, you'd almost always say ""How old are you?"" or ""What year were you born?"" or ""When you were born?"" -- with the first one being by far the most common.

If you were asking about an object, you would usually say ""How old is it?""  But you might also say ""When was it built?"" (in reference to a building or structure) or ""How long has it been here?"" or ""How many years has it been here?"" or ""How long has it been around?"" -- again, the simple ""How old is it?"" would be most common.

However, I'm concerned about the interpretation of these data when the data may span more than one UTM zone. Most of my data are in UTM zone 3 with some data points seeping into zone 4. In more extreme cases, my data may span from zone 1 to 4. 

Am I being really ignorant in thinking that I can compare across zone boundaries? 
Since I am interested only in relative differences between calculations with the same distortion, will it not matter? 
Should I simply make sure that I have my UTM origin set at the southwesterly most point of the data and I'm fine from there?

5716,5716,9056,Can I make a graph of savings in Quicken?,"I've used the ""Reports and Graphs"" section of Quicken in a very basic capacity to see where my money has been going -- ""Income / Expenses"" and ""Spending by Category"" mostly -- and I've been trying to branch out and try the other reports/graphs to get a better idea of my finances.

Here's what I'd like to do:  See a simple graph that shows how much of my money went to Savings each month.

The closest I've found is the ""Net Worth"" chart, where the amount it goes up (or down) is the amount I've saved (or overspent).  I'd like one that shows (Total Income - Total Expenses) over time.  I've also tried the ""Income/Expense"" Graph, but that shows separate bars for income and expense, and I want to show a single bar (or a line graph would be nice too).
",Tim,https://money.stackexchange.com/users/10199,"I found a way to do this, but it's slightly backwards.

Quicken does not allow you to make a graph of just your income, probably because that would be a fairly boring graph for most people.  But it does allow you to do a graph of your expenses.  Doing so, while including income categories, will produce the graph I want, but with negative numbers (savings is negative spending).


Go to Reports -> Reports and Graph Center in the main menu.
In the Quicken Standard Reports section, go to Spending by Category
Click the Customize button.
On the Customize Spending by Category window, on the Categories tab, add all Income and Expense categories (but no Bank categories).
Click Show Graph.
Set the Column to Month.  This will switch it from a pie chart to a bar graph


This will show a bar graph of overall spending, counting income as Negative Spending.  So, having negative bars is good in this case.

I've also tried the ""Income/Expense"" Graph, but that shows separate bars for income and expense, and I want to show a single bar (or a line graph would be nice too).
","I found a way to do this, but it's slightly backwards.

Quicken does not allow you to make a graph of just your income, probably because that would be a fairly boring graph for most people.  But it does allow you to do a graph of your expenses.  Doing so, while including income categories, will produce the graph I want, but with negative numbers (savings is negative spending).


Go to Reports -> Reports and Graph Center in the main menu.
In the Quicken Standard Reports section, go to Spending by Category
Click the Customize button.
On the Customize Spending by Category window, on the Categories tab, add all Income and Expense categories (but no Bank categories).
Click Show Graph.
Set the Column to Month.  This will switch it from a pie chart to a bar graph


This will show a bar graph of overall spending, counting income as Negative Spending.  So, having negative bars is good in this case.

What does the nuclear fusion of hydrogen atoms in the sun look like? Can protiums participate too? Where does, then, the helium atom get a neutron from, as there are no neutrons in protiums?
",Roll,https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/66492,"The main fusion reaction in the sun is the proton-proton chain reaction, which takes six protons and produces two protons, one alpha particle, two anti-electrons, and two electron neutrinos.

The deuterium nucleus is only barely bound and can be destroyed — dissociated into a proton and neutron — by absorbing a gamma ray with energy more than 2 MeV. This means that all of the sun's ""primordial"" deuterium, formed in the first minutes after the Big Bang, was destroyed before the sun got hot enough to begin fusing on its own. Essentially all of the deuterium in the sun exists as an intermediate step in the proton-proton fusion cycle.

Tritium, furthermore, is naturally unstable, with a half-life of only 12 years. This means that any tritium in the sun (or anywhere else) has been mostly produced in the past few dozen years.  On Earth tritium is produced by cosmic rays interacting with stable matter.  In the sun most of the tritium would come from neutron capture on deuterium (where I suppose the neutrons would have come from dissociated deuterium) or nucleon-exchange or proton-knockout reactions on helium-3 and helium-4.

A relatively authoritative solar model I grabbed some time ago from this paper (or more properly, from here) lists the helium-3 fraction, but not the deuterium fraction or tritium fraction. If we assume they are comparable (or at least related) then you can see that it still depends on where you are in the sun:

Can such a thing be done?  I have a vague idea that I might make a text file with a list of the new names and call that list @newnames.  I would make another array out of the current file names, and call it @oldnames.  I'd then do some kind of for loop where each element $i in @oldnames is replaced by the corresponding $i in @newnames.

I don't know how to make an array out of my current file names, though, and so I'm not sure if this vague idea is on the right track.  I keep my files with the messed-up names in a directory called 'oldnames'. The below is my attempt to make an array out of the file names in that directory:

my $dir = 'oldnames';
opendir ('oldnames', $dir) or die ""cannot open dir $dir: $!"";
my @file = readdir 'oldnames';
closedir 'oldnames';

print ""@file\n"";


The above didn't seem to do anything. I'm lost. Help?

By cooling the oil, the oil will stay viable longer as well as it will not want to build up sludge as much. It will also be able to cool the engine better, which means the engine itself will last longer. Using an oil cooler works especially well for supercharged or turbo-charged engines.

5098,5098,8107,Is there an analogue of the jordan normal form of an nilpotent linear transform of a polynomial ring?,"Is there an analogue of the Jordan Normal Form for an infinite dimensional vector space?

In general I think the answer is no.  It's been awhile since I studied it, but I'm pretty sure something would go wrong in distinguishing eigenvalues for an infinite dimensional space.  Normally, for infinite dimensional vector spaces, you have some topology that allows you to define compact operators, et cetera, that are easier to study.  But in my specific case I'm looking at an nilpotent linear map $D: F[X] \to F[X]$, where $F$ is a finite field.  I'm actually trying to find the kernel of said map.  I hope that a transformation to a suitably friendly basis would help (hence why I'm asking about jordan normal forms!).  Is $F[x]$ close enough to finite that there might be something similar to the JNF that can help?  

Some motivation:
For $f \in F_2[x]$ and $F_4 = F_2[\mu]/(\mu^2 + \mu + 1)$, the map is $Df = f(x + \mu) - f(x)$ (so actually $D: F_2[x] \to F_4[x]$, but clearly this can be thought of as an endomorphism).  I'm trying to find the kernel of this map in $F_2$.  Originally, I thought it would be spanned by elements like $x^{2^n} + x^{2^{n-2}}$, since $(x + \mu)^n$ would have a lot of non-zero terms when n isn't a power of 2.  But after trying to prove that, I found several counterexamples (exempli gratia $x^{12} + x^9 + x^6 + x^3$).  Additionally, if $\text{deg}f=n$, I have $n$ equations that the coefficients of $f$ must satisify for $f$ to be in the kernel, and I believe I can show that we can have polynomials of 8, 16, 32, et cetera, terms that aren't sums of something that has fewer terms and already is in the kernel, but that's quite a bit of work!  So I've decided to try looking for a different basis for $F_2[x]$ that would get close to diagonalizing the matrix of $D$. But as @Mariano, pointed out, this may not be any easier...

Edit before I provided and motivation, this question asked about idempotent maps and not nilpotent. But that was because I was being silly and got the terms ""idempotent"" and ""nilpotent"" confused.  I didn't catch my mistake until @Mariano reminded me that an idempotent operator is a projection when he answered the idempotent question.  The map $D$ is clearly not idempotent!
",mebassett,https://math.stackexchange.com/users/27165,"Let $f:V\to V$ be an idempotent endomorphism of any vector space over any field. Let $V_0=\ker f$ and $V_1=\{v\in V:f(v)=v\}$.

It follows that every idempotent endomorphism of a vector space is diagonalizable, and that its only possible eigenvalues are zero and one. Finite dimensionality plays no role in this context.

4453,4453,7066,Is it ethical to profit by having my students buy my textbook?,"This question was suggested to me by How can I sell my text book to my students in e-book format? which asked about the practicalities, but attracted many comments about the ethics.  So this question is to ask about the ethics directly.

Suppose I have written and published a textbook, and I want to use it as the text for a course I am teaching.  I receive royalties from each copy of my book that is sold, so if my students are required to buy my textbook for the course, I will make some money.  Is it ethical to do so?

Well-reasoned opinions would be useful answers, but even more useful would be pointers to institutional policies, professional codes of ethics, etc, that address this issue.

Of course, there are many ways to avoid profiting from the sale of my book to my students.  If my contract with my publisher allows it, I could distribute PDFs to my students, or have the university bookstore print out copies and sell them at cost.  Another approach I've heard of is to compute how much I earn in royalties on each copy, and refund that amount from my pocket to each student who buys a copy.  Or, use my royalty earnings to buy pizza for the class.  Certainly these are nice gestures, but I would like opinions on whether they are ethically required.

Edit: To address some questions that have arisen in the comments:


This question is hypothetical.  I haven't published any textbooks myself and have no immediate plans to do so.  In any case, my personal preference would be to make the book available to students for free, if at all possible.  So I've phrased this question in the first person for rhetorical convenience only.
I had intended the question to be only about the potential financial conflict of interest that could arise if I make money by assigning my own book.  Some of the answers feel that it is improper for me to assign my own textbook at all, whether I make money or not, but I don't think this point of view is prevalent within the academic community.  If it happens that my book (as a pithy but now-deleted comment put it) ""blows"", I think most would agree that my decision to assign it is pedagogically unfortunate, but not unethical.  
I don't literally mean that students would be required to buy the book, only that they'd be expected to have it.  I might assign readings or homework problems from the book, so that the student needs access to the book in order to do them, but they could certainly achieve this by getting a used copy or borrowing from a friend.  But probably most students would buy new copies anyway, since that is the most convenient way.

",Nate Eldredge,https://academia.stackexchange.com/users/1010,"Short answer: I think it is neither ethical nor good (in terms of education, independent of ethics) to force students to use your textbook.

(Assuming that we are talking about a ""normal"" lecture, as opposed to a workshop about your book.)



Long answer: I see 3 different (but connected) difficulties here. None of them needs to be a problem, but together, they can trap the students. 


requiring a particular textbook: to me this is less of an ethical problem if it doesn't boil down to forcing the students to buy that particular book.
Nevertheless, I think it preferable from an education point of view to teach students that they left the kind of school where exactly one solution exists, and now they are in a world with lots of sensible alternatives. Giving  recommendations* (plural!), IMHO it is a most important point to make that the library holds even more useful books [also on that topic].
more or less forcing students to buy a textbook  


(Recall that the origin of ""lecture"" is that a (text)book was read to the students. So historically, the lecture was a solution to the problem that books were too expensive for students to buy.)


I don't see why buying the textbook is necessary. Even if book and lecture are (naturally) close. 


  I might assign readings or homework problems from the book, so that the student needs access to the book in order to do them


Why would that be:


Is is that difficult to prepare a slide of the homework problem which is displayed at the end of the lecture or a pdf that can be downloaded?
Reading: I have to say that at university I've never experienced assigned reading from a textbook. So my question to you is: is it really necessary to assign reading chapter 7.4 as opposed to assign preparing the principles of pH electrodes? Also, I've seen reading materials for download.
Making small parts of the book available to the students is probably possible even if the contract with the publisher doesn't let you distribute pdfs to the students. At least, e.g. in Germany, it is even possible to hand small parts from any book (not only yours!) to the class for teaching purposes.
For the self-study aspect of the textbook, there is the textbook collection of the library. The university libraries I know have sensible numbers of the important textbooks to be borrowed by the students plus a number of copies that stay in the library so they are always accessible.  Are the books there really not sufficient? If so, why not? Why are the important books not there? How can books be bought?
(How to get your book into the collection is part of the next point:)

Possible conflict of interest because it is your own textbook.
This is the interesting part. But, if you take care of the first two problems, there is already much less space for an actual conflict of interest (≈ a real problem for the students) here.
Or, taking another point of view, I perceive taking unfair advantage of the position***  as a symptom of (un)ethical behaviour which is closely bound to the whole character. In that I perceive it less of a single problem that is solved or not by a particular line of action on this point but rather a problem that appears with some people and not with others.
In yet other words, people who take advantage of their position tend to do that in more ways than just this (e.g. in the combination of my three points - at which point @JeffE probably recommends to run). The formal action of not requiring their own textbook doesn't help much. Students will conclude from the general reputation/perception of taking unfair advantage that the book is required - whether it is stated openly or not. 


I guess it is one of the topics where those who do worry whether what they do is ethical are the ones who don't need to worry (because they do act ethically) - it would be far more important that those who don't would start to worry...

Whether to donate copies of your own textbook to the library, 
make a donation that reimburses the library for your royalties, or 
convince the library to buy it like any other book, and/or 
whether and how you want to reimburse students 
is IMHO unanswerable as a general question.
I think valid points can be made for and against** each of the options here.

Good and sensible decisions will depend a lot on the particular circumstances and even more on the personality of the professor.



Side note: 


  Or, use my royalty earnings to buy pizza for the class.


I object to this option on the following ethical grounds: If my problem is that I'm too poor to buy textbooks, I don't want to spend money on pizza but would rather like to save that money towards the next textbook. 



* A professor not recommending his own textbook sounds about as convincing to me as a vegetarian running a sausage factory. 

** Here's the advocatus diaboli against each of the points:


Donating books to the library? Someone is buying fame!
Reimbursing the royalties - same as above, but more greedy (or the one above was more desperate for fame...)
Convinced some committee to buy the books? Surely there is a textbook-buying circle emerging: You scratch my back and I'll scratch yours.  
reimbursing students who buy the book: that's an obvious attempt to whitewash the reputation
and so on


*** As long as you do not take advantage of your situation, the conflict of interest is at most your problem (i.e. you are worried). If you take unfair advantage, the students have a problem.

155,155,243,Bulk exporting/archiving collections in Lightroom,"Is there any way to export images from my collections, where the images are automatically placed into a folder tree that mimics their collections?

I'm not comfortable with having all that organization data locked away in Lightroom -- I switch computers a lot and oftentimes data sidecars like Lightroom's DB get lost in the shuffle. I'd like to export all my images into folders that can then be fed into Crashplan, etc.

Ideally I want it to archive only images in each collection that match a Smart search criteria, like 4+ stars.

jF's Collection Publisher plugin looks nice but it has its own collection tree that must be maintained separately. This solution is not DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) enough for me: I don't want to maintain two separate hierarchies of collections.

EDIT: To clarify, let's assume I have images sorted in collections as such:

&lt; Collection root &gt;
    |- California
    |  |- Surfers
    |  |- Hipsters
    |  |- Beaches
    |- Holland
       |- Windmills
       |- Stroopwaffels
       |- Coffeeshops
       |- Grachten


I am looking for something that exports images into a folder tree identical to the one above, without any extra maintenance or work. So JPG or TIFF files would be exported/published to:

/Users/tom/Photography/California/Surfers
/Users/tom/Photography/California/Hipsters
/Users/tom/Photography/California/Beaches
/Users/tom/Photography/Holland/Windmills
/Users/tom/Photography/Holland/Stroopwaffels
/Users/tom/Photography/Holland/Coffeeshops
/Users/tom/Photography/Holland/Grachten


In accordance with the collections they live in in LR. jF's plugin is nice but it works from  its own collection tree, which makes it unsuitable for this kind of request.
",Tom Corelis,https://photo.stackexchange.com/users/11542,"I'm not sure exactly what you mean by ""mimics their collections,"" but I do something similar to what you're describing in my Dropbox and Aperture exports.

(Dropbox for off-site backup, Aperture for intelligent iDevice sharing. Yes, I bought Aperture just to make iTunes happy. You're welcome, Apple.)

I use Jeffrey Friedl's Folder Publisher plugin, rather than the Collection Publisher. I chose it because what I'm interested in is mirroring the on-disk folder structure as represented in LR's Folders pane, but using Smart Collections to select which photos get published.

Like you, I choose not to mirror my low-rated photos to the export sets, for example, a perfect job for Smart Collections.

If you use the built-in Hard Drive publish service instead, you get a flat folder of images, with name collisions resolved rather brutally.

For some reason, photo names don't always survive a trip through the Folder Publisher intact. If I have a 1.jpg in two different folders, they seem to get a unique number appended anyway, even though it isn't actually necessary. I suspect this is a limitation of the Lightroom programming API. There are a lot of such areas, where the limits of Adobe's own needs for the API get reflected into the API, so that Adobe's limitations become your limitations.

That problem doesn't really bother me, though, since the name of a photo file is of minimal concern. If I ever had to rebuild my Lightroom library from a Dropbox snapshot (shudder) I'd be much more interested in the folder structure and the photo metadata, both of which the Folder Publisher plugin preserves.

About the only metadata you lose are things like virtual copies and stacks.

Obviously you're also baking photo adjustments (DNG + XMP) into JPEGs when doing this. You should have a separate ""real"" backup.

I consider my Dropbox export to be a ""my house burned down and then my city was hit by an asteroid and then it slid into an abyss"" sort of backup. As for the Aperture export, photo names, the distinction between multiple JPEGs and virtual copies, and stacking is of no concern whatsoever.

Another option you can look into is LR/TreeExporter. I used to use it, but it hasn't been updated since the LR3 days, and at the time I started using it, the jf Folder Publisher plugin hadn't been created yet. Jeffrey is more responsive, and I like the way the plugin works better besides.

jF's Collection Publisher plugin looks nice but it has its own collection tree that must be maintained separately. This solution is not DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) enough for me: I don't want to maintain two separate hierarchies of collections.

EDIT: To clarify, let's assume I have images sorted in collections as such:

&lt; Collection root &gt;
    |- California
    |  |- Surfers
    |  |- Hipsters
    |  |- Beaches
    |- Holland
       |- Windmills
       |- Stroopwaffels
       |- Coffeeshops
       |- Grachten


I am looking for something that exports images into a folder tree identical to the one above, without any extra maintenance or work. So JPG or TIFF files would be exported/published to:

/Users/tom/Photography/California/Surfers
/Users/tom/Photography/California/Hipsters
/Users/tom/Photography/California/Beaches
/Users/tom/Photography/Holland/Windmills
/Users/tom/Photography/Holland/Stroopwaffels
/Users/tom/Photography/Holland/Coffeeshops
/Users/tom/Photography/Holland/Grachten


In accordance with the collections they live in in LR. jF's plugin is nice but it works from  its own collection tree, which makes it unsuitable for this kind of request.
","I'm not sure exactly what you mean by ""mimics their collections,"" but I do something similar to what you're describing in my Dropbox and Aperture exports.

(Dropbox for off-site backup, Aperture for intelligent iDevice sharing. Yes, I bought Aperture just to make iTunes happy. You're welcome, Apple.)

I use Jeffrey Friedl's Folder Publisher plugin, rather than the Collection Publisher. I chose it because what I'm interested in is mirroring the on-disk folder structure as represented in LR's Folders pane, but using Smart Collections to select which photos get published.

Like you, I choose not to mirror my low-rated photos to the export sets, for example, a perfect job for Smart Collections.

If you use the built-in Hard Drive publish service instead, you get a flat folder of images, with name collisions resolved rather brutally.

For some reason, photo names don't always survive a trip through the Folder Publisher intact. If I have a 1.jpg in two different folders, they seem to get a unique number appended anyway, even though it isn't actually necessary. I suspect this is a limitation of the Lightroom programming API. There are a lot of such areas, where the limits of Adobe's own needs for the API get reflected into the API, so that Adobe's limitations become your limitations.

That problem doesn't really bother me, though, since the name of a photo file is of minimal concern. If I ever had to rebuild my Lightroom library from a Dropbox snapshot (shudder) I'd be much more interested in the folder structure and the photo metadata, both of which the Folder Publisher plugin preserves.

About the only metadata you lose are things like virtual copies and stacks.

Obviously you're also baking photo adjustments (DNG + XMP) into JPEGs when doing this. You should have a separate ""real"" backup.

I consider my Dropbox export to be a ""my house burned down and then my city was hit by an asteroid and then it slid into an abyss"" sort of backup. As for the Aperture export, photo names, the distinction between multiple JPEGs and virtual copies, and stacking is of no concern whatsoever.

Another option you can look into is LR/TreeExporter. I used to use it, but it hasn't been updated since the LR3 days, and at the time I started using it, the jf Folder Publisher plugin hadn't been created yet. Jeffrey is more responsive, and I like the way the plugin works better besides.

2248,2248,3584,Export Resolution in Adobe Illustrator,"I've mainly used Photoshop before and only just picked up Illustrator a few days ago. Anyway, I used Illustrator to create lots of images (with transparent backgrounds) of different letters, each one filled with circles. More to the point, upon exporting as a .PNG, I noticed a resolution option. Me being the little derp that I am, I figured a larger resolution is always better, so I set this to high (300 ppi).

Upon importing the images into my project however, I realized that the images had become a lot larger than they should be. Upon tweaking the export resolution setting, I noticed that if I set this to low (72 ppi), the images come out as the expected size. I was just wondering how I should expect this to effect my drawings. If I were to keep the high resolution images I exported at 300 ppi, am I always going to be forced to reduce their size afterwards by a certain amount? Otherwise, should I always stick to  72 ppi in order to keep the size of the image the same and to avoid needing to re-size things later?

Image quality is not so important in this case, so there probably isn't much reason for me to use anything higher than 72 ppi anyway. Just for the sake of learning however, I thought this would be a good question to ask.

",krammer,https://academia.stackexchange.com/users/2823,"Here are some of my strayed thoughts.

Think from return of investments, of yours and your idol's

If you ever perceived that your e-mail would be a ""waste of their time,"" then why send it? I feel that most eminent researchers have a trait of ""ignore everyone and head for their goal;"" getting acknowledgement and acceptance is probably not their primary concern. A specific e-mail describing how their work has inspired your study/project is probably fine, but I wouldn't go so far to expect they would reply and give specific comments on your hypotheses.

From your point of view, instead of using the energy and bandwidth to send the e-mails, there are a lot more you can do:

There are many ways to show your appreciation

First, they would probably like to see their work being formally cited and, more importantly, applied to the field or crossed into other fields. Each idea geminated from their work is an appreciation by itself, and in the mean time you can also enhance your publication and research paradigm. The plus is: if you have done enough of it, the big shot may actually contact you and give comments.

Second, you can help preaching the researcher's ideas and agenda. You can write blogs, answer other people questions, use their works in your journal clubs or lectures, etc. to subtly introduce the researcher's teaching to the public. Better yet, refine the researcher's ideas, and incorporate into yours. Become a spiritual successor with your own unique approach. And let your career be inspired by the researcher.

You can learn from someone without establishing communication

For some more senior researchers, look for their auto-biography, biography, interviews, and documentaries that feature them. I will probably never be able to talk to Itzhak Perlman, but I learned a lot about him through books, websites, documentaries, and musics that he plays. (And actually, he has a Youtube channel as well, but I am suffering from too much fanboy shyness to write any comment.)

For younger researchers, try look for their blogs, Youtube channels, open courses, or even biographies of their mentors. All these may help you become more familiar with them.

Another way is to indirectly know them. Most of these researchers would have a lot of students or proteges, who may be closer to your rank and more likely to communicate with you. You may build a relationship with them, and learn a thing or two about their interaction with their mentor.

Try technology

For their new publications... nowadays most online journals allow leaving comments online. You may try to say a nice thing or two there. If they write a blog, that's even easier. Some researchers maintain a LinkedIn page or a Twitter account, try connect with them and follow them. Hope for the best.

Use other famous people as leverage

If you really want to communicate with them, also try using other organizations. For instance, you can write to some online radio station and suggest an interview topic and some guests, which of course will include your idolized researcher. You can also write to some prominent podcast hosts and give them a couple reason to invite so and so for an interview. Make good use of crowdsourcing, invite your peers and friends to support your petition.

Some heroes/heroines are better left a bit mysterious

This is sad but occasionally painfully true. Some famous people are better left not known at personal level. They could be immensely arrogant, they may not have a nanogram of social skill, they may be a jerk...

1910,1910,3042,Does scratched Teflon coated frying pans contain carcinogens which can cause cancer?,"Is it true that using scratched Teflon-coated pans contain carcinogens, and if so, can they be consumed through the food cooked in them?

E.g.


The deadly toxins from non-stick frying pans

",kenorb,https://biology.stackexchange.com/users/1195,"The question and link imply that if cooking with Teflon generates carcinogens that carcinogens then always lead to cancer. This is not always true. In some cases exposure to carcinogens may signal protective pathways. Oncogenesis and exposure to both genotoxic and non-genotoxic carcinogens are not always positively correlated. Cooking with Teflon influences how you cook, and it's how you cook that has the greatest effect on the levels of carcinogens in food.

Cooked food contains carcinogens in the form of reactive oxygen species. This is related more to the heat its cooked at than the type of cookware used. Carcinogen exposure in the heating of biological material is an interesting subject.

Carcinogens can be classified in 2 categories (1):


Genotoxic carcinogens (Reactive Oxygen Species/ROS)
Non-genotoxic carcinogens (PFOA is thought to be here)


Genotoxic carcinogens facilitate the formation of cancer through alterations in a cell's DNA. 

Non-genotoxic '...carcinogens have no direct interaction with DNA; they are believed to cause tumors by disrupting cellular structures and by changing the rate of either cell proliferation or of processes that increase the risk of genetic error. (1)'

The molecular mechanism most often thought of for cancer formation is genotoxic oncogenesis, damage to DNA. Here, genotoxic oncogenesis often involves a reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS may generate free radicals which, when reacting with other molecules, generate more free radicals. Another example of a reaction involving free radicals is a fire. Human cells contain genes for antioxidant enzymes, like glutathione and superoxide dismutase, which catalytically converts the free radical superoxide into hydrogen peroxide. 

The abundance of ROS in our cells has 2 components:


Production of ROS
Depletion of ROS by upregulation of antioxidant enzymes


Intracellular levels of ROS positively regulate levels of antioxidant enzymes like glutathione and superoxide dismutase (2). This means that more oxidative stress leades to more protection from ROS by antioxidant enzymes. This is why exercise, while increasing ROS levels, actually protects against them.

ROS are also produced during the cooking of food, especially meat (3). This applies to any type of cookware, any method of heating of any food: protein, carbohydrates, fats. 


'For example, it only takes a few hours at 70C to have the same extent of autoxidation which at room temperature requires months (4)'


Intracellular ROS are unavoidable. They are produced by normal metabolism, exercise, cosmic radiation, during the consumption of food. Balancing this are endogenous antioxidant enzymes. The antioxidant power of glutatione exceeds any known nutritional supplement (5). 

Exercise is an extremely effective upregulator of antioxidant enzymes, eclipsing any antioxidant supplement or change in cookware. Regular physical activity will most likely be the best prevention one can take against ROS induced genotoxic oncogenesis.

Non-genotoxic '...carcinogens have no direct interaction with DNA; they are believed to cause tumors by disrupting cellular structures and by changing the rate of either cell proliferation or of processes that increase the risk of genetic error. (1)'

The molecular mechanism most often thought of for cancer formation is genotoxic oncogenesis, damage to DNA. Here, genotoxic oncogenesis often involves a reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS may generate free radicals which, when reacting with other molecules, generate more free radicals. Another example of a reaction involving free radicals is a fire. Human cells contain genes for antioxidant enzymes, like glutathione and superoxide dismutase, which catalytically converts the free radical superoxide into hydrogen peroxide. 

The abundance of ROS in our cells has 2 components:


Production of ROS
Depletion of ROS by upregulation of antioxidant enzymes


Intracellular levels of ROS positively regulate levels of antioxidant enzymes like glutathione and superoxide dismutase (2). This means that more oxidative stress leades to more protection from ROS by antioxidant enzymes. This is why exercise, while increasing ROS levels, actually protects against them.

ROS are also produced during the cooking of food, especially meat (3). This applies to any type of cookware, any method of heating of any food: protein, carbohydrates, fats. 


'For example, it only takes a few hours at 70C to have the same extent of autoxidation which at room temperature requires months (4)'


Intracellular ROS are unavoidable. They are produced by normal metabolism, exercise, cosmic radiation, during the consumption of food. Balancing this are endogenous antioxidant enzymes. The antioxidant power of glutatione exceeds any known nutritional supplement (5). 

Exercise is an extremely effective upregulator of antioxidant enzymes, eclipsing any antioxidant supplement or change in cookware. Regular physical activity will most likely be the best prevention one can take against ROS induced genotoxic oncogenesis.

",Maulik V,https://ell.stackexchange.com/users/3187,"By analogy with words you already know. In more detail, you guess mainly by recognizing morphemes, taking into account the three main spelling systems that exist within English and taking into account common phonetic pressures that alter pronunciations. Educated guessing cannot be reduced to rules, of course, but I can give you a feel for it with a scattering of examples.

Morphemes

Morphemes are the smallest elements of a word that have a meaning. For example, -ing and -tion are morphemes, as in going and information. If you know a lot of morphemes, you will be good at guessing pronunciation, because morphemes are usually spelled in only one or two ways, and their pronunciation in one word usually works by analogy with their pronunciation in other words. 

For example, if you've seen -tion carrying that meaning in a number of words, you intelligently guess that it's pronounced the same way in a word you've never seen before, such as, say, transubstantiation. By analogy with relation, generation, acceleration, and many similar words, even transmission, which has the other spelling of the morpheme and is preceded by a different vowel, you can reasonably guess that conflagration has the stress on the second a. And you can intelligently guess that informational has the stress on -mā-.

This doesn't give you the correct pronunciation in every single case—equation is slightly different—but this is fundamentally how English spelling and pronunciation work: by analogy with related words, where having the same morpheme is the most important kind of relation.

Etymological spelling

English actually has three main spelling systems, corresponding to its three main root languages: Anglo-Saxon, Latin, and Greek.

Anglo-Saxon

In an Anglo-Saxon word, a vowel needs to be followed by two consonants or a consonant at the end of a word in order to be short. For example, batted vs. bated, chipped vs. griped. You know that mob is /mǒb/, not /mōb/, because of this pattern. In Anglo-Saxon words, it's as if every vowel wants to be long, but gets cut short by a terminal consonant. In Anglo-Saxon words, ch is usually pronounced /tʃ/, the ""native"" pronunciation.

Latin

Not so in words from Latin. Risible is /ˈrĭz.ə.bl/, not /ˈrīz.ə.bl/, and there's really no way to guess that, except perhaps by a rather superficial analogy with divisible and visible. Words from Latin usually follow pretty regular spelling, but in many cases you can't tell whether a morpheme's vowel will be long or short from its spelling—though often you can make a good guess by analogy with other words.

The soft pronunciations of c and g before i and e began in Latin, and were only introduced into English with the Norman invasion. So, Latin-derived words are normally pronounced that way, and most of the exceptions come from Anglo-Saxon, such as get, girl, and together. Anglo-Saxon words like bagged and bagging use the doubled g to indicate that the preceding vowel is short, so the g stays hard. Exaggerate and suggest come from Latin, so you know not to expect their soft g to make a good precedent for Anglo-Saxon words.

Greek

Words from Greek have a distinct spelling system, where English letters correspond to Greek letters: ch stands for the Greek letter χ; ph stands for the Greek letter φ; k stands for the Greek letter κ; th stands for θ; etc. The Greek sounds of these letters are approximated by English phonemes, as in chrysanthemum, metaphor, photon, system, synchronize, autarky, etc. Notice that ch in Greek-derived words is pronounced /k/. Greek consonant clusters that don't occur in English get reduced, as in psychology, bdellium, and pneumonia (but not sphere: we allowed /sf-/ to start a syllable in order to absorb that word). Eu- in Greek words is a morpheme meaning ""good"", and is pronounced /ju-/, as in eulogy and euphemism. Leonhard Euler is German, so you learn not to make an analogy between his name and Greek words. 

The main difficulties with Greek-derived words involve the letters g and y, especially when they occur together. In Greek-derived words, g stands for the Greek letter γ, which we would normally represent in speech with a hard g  as in gynecology and gigabyte, but phonetic pressures and misunderstandings have usually set precedents that make it soft, as in gymnasium and gyroscope. It goes silent when it's part of a reduced, un-English consonant cluster, as in gneiss. In the middle of Greek-derived words, y stands for υ, but at the end, it stands for -εια, which means the same as Anglo-Saxon -ness. The Greek vowel υ doesn't correspond well to any English vowel. Usually it's pronounced as a short /ĭ/, but English phonetic pressures sometimes shape it into a long /ī/, as in hypothesis, psychology, and papyrus. The -gy ending is a morpheme, pronounced /-dʒē/ (unstressed), found in energy, synergy, biology and even analogy, the main concept that explains how English works!

Can you really guess the origin of an unknown word?

You might wonder, ""How am I supposed to guess which language a word came from?"" It's surprisingly easy. Anglo-Saxon, Latin, and Greek words tend to have a very different ""feel"" to them, and the spellings of the words tend to follow patterns that are fairly easy to recognize. Noticing the different styles of words from each main root language is an important part of mastering English, including its huge vocabulary of synonyms. There are, of course, a few  words that picked up spellings by ""false etymology"", such as ache and ptarmigan, but happily, it doesn't matter, because if you guess these words' pronunciations by the usual analogies, you'll be right. These spellings were established by people trying to follow the same analogies.

By the way, roughly 20–30 years ago, many schools stopped teaching children about classical roots and how they're spelled. Consequently, a lot of natives today don't know much about it consciously. So, with this clue, you can learn to do better than a lot of natives! Some kids are still being taught, though, as evidenced by the questions asked in this contest of guessing the spelling of a word (which is harder than guessing the pronunciation from the spelling). Here's an excellent article by an expert on dyslexia, about the true complexity of English spelling and what's involved in learning it. 

Conflicting precedents

Precedents can conflict. For example, you can make a good educated guess about impious by noticing its three morphemes: im-, meaning negation; pi-, meaning reverence or dutifulness, by analogy with pious and piety; and -ous, making an adjective in a Latin style. So, a pretty good guess is to pronounce it /ǐm.ˈpī.əs/. However, impious can also be understood as following the precedent of the Latin word impius. The phonetic pressures in Latin put the stress on the first syllable, and we usually feel the same pressures in English words that come from Latin. In fact, the English word impious, pronounced /ˈǐm.pē.əs/, was borrowed directly from Latin in the 16th century. That pronunciation has been echoed ever since. The -ous spelling in impious is a slightly stretched analogy with Latin borrowings that follow a different pattern. Consequently, both pronunciations are in use today, /ˈǐm.pē.əs/ being more standard. (I prefer /ǐm.ˈpī.əs/, since it communicates the morphemes more clearly. Someone who's never heard it before will easily understand the meaning. /ˈǐmp.ē.əs/ misleadingly echoes imp.)

Pressures

I knew a native speaker who mispronounced fruition as /ˈfru.ʃən/. He was going by analogy with fruit. But /ˈfru.ʃən/ is a somewhat uneducated guess. The correct pronunciation, /fru.ˈǐʃ.ən/, better reflects both the etymology and the pressure from -tion to put stress on the preceding vowel. The spelling of fruit reflects the fact that it can break up when used as a morpheme in a larger word. And we see the same pattern established in circuit/circuitous and other -uit- words.

There is another factor at work here, too, which helps a lot for guessing pronunciations. Experience teaches you that common pressures will likely have removed the second syllable from /ˈfru.ĭt/, but these pressures don't occur in fruition. In English, there's a pressure to merge those last two syllables at the end of a word, as in biscuit, pursuit and circuit. Explaining phonetic pressures is a complex subject, but it's like everything else in English: it works by analogies and precedents, and you get a feel for it from experience. What's relevant here is that the unstressed short vowel has a hard time holding its own against the preceding long, stressed vowel without help from another consonant; the terminal -t offers only very weak support.

The word intuit is the only word of this pattern that has kept that unstressed syllable. I think people continue to pronounce it because the words intuitive and intuition are much more common, so when people use the unusual verb intuit, they feel some pressure to echo the corresponding syllable in the familiar words in order to be understood. I have heard people attempt /ǐn.ˈtut/, independently inventing the word during conversation, and then draw back from it because it sounds weird and doesn't clearly indicate the connection with intuition. There is also pressure to avoid echoing the slightly silly verb ""toot"".

Since pronunciation is shaped by interaction between many pressures, if you pay attention to those pressures, you are in a good position to guess the pronunciations of unknown words.

Analogies, not rules

Some people harp on the fact that English spelling doesn't follow rules, as if this were proof that English is ""illogical"" or completely without order. Really, though, the English language works like English common law: by precedents, not rules. When deciding new cases, or when inventing new words, people try to be consistent with previous cases or with the spellings of words already in the language. Old cases and familiar words can't pre-decide every aspect of a new case, of course. Law and language accumulate over the centuries, one case and one word at a time, embodying subtlety and hopefully wisdom beyond what could be captured by any fully articulated system of rules.

As you get to know the language better, you can often guess pronunciation from spelling pretty accurately, especially with ""big"" words. When I was in the 2nd grade (age 7), I was given a test where I had to guess the pronunciations of a long list of words, up to ""college level"". I got nearly all of them right, despite not knowing, at that age, anything about etymological spelling—and despite not having encountered most of the words before. I could usually see some sort of analogy with a word I already knew, and I made an educated guess. That's how it works.

The moral of all this is that you should not memorize rules. You should not even memorize the few rules that happen to be true. Memorizing rules runs against the spirit of the language. What you should do is make analogies from specific words to specific words that you already know how to pronounce. Occasionally you'll guess wrong—and that will teach you a new precedent, which you will apply in new situations. Eventually, gradually, you learn to perceive English spellings with acuity. (You can probably guess that it's /ə.ˈcju.ĭ.tē/, despite the spelling's ambiguity, because of its congruity with annuity and gratuity.)

For example, you can make a good educated guess about impious by noticing its three morphemes: im-, meaning negation; pi-, meaning reverence or dutifulness, by analogy with pious and piety; and -ous, making an adjective in a Latin style. So, a pretty good guess is to pronounce it /ǐm.ˈpī.əs/. However, impious can also be understood as following the precedent of the Latin word impius. The phonetic pressures in Latin put the stress on the first syllable, and we usually feel the same pressures in English words that come from Latin. In fact, the English word impious, pronounced /ˈǐm.pē.əs/, was borrowed directly from Latin in the 16th century. That pronunciation has been echoed ever since. The -ous spelling in impious is a slightly stretched analogy with Latin borrowings that follow a different pattern. Consequently, both pronunciations are in use today, /ˈǐm.pē.əs/ being more standard. (I prefer /ǐm.ˈpī.əs/, since it communicates the morphemes more clearly. Someone who's never heard it before will easily understand the meaning. /ˈǐmp.ē.əs/ misleadingly echoes imp.)

Pressures

I knew a native speaker who mispronounced fruition as /ˈfru.ʃən/. He was going by analogy with fruit. But /ˈfru.ʃən/ is a somewhat uneducated guess. The correct pronunciation, /fru.ˈǐʃ.ən/, better reflects both the etymology and the pressure from -tion to put stress on the preceding vowel. The spelling of fruit reflects the fact that it can break up when used as a morpheme in a larger word. And we see the same pattern established in circuit/circuitous and other -uit- words.

There is another factor at work here, too, which helps a lot for guessing pronunciations. Experience teaches you that common pressures will likely have removed the second syllable from /ˈfru.ĭt/, but these pressures don't occur in fruition. In English, there's a pressure to merge those last two syllables at the end of a word, as in biscuit, pursuit and circuit. Explaining phonetic pressures is a complex subject, but it's like everything else in English: it works by analogies and precedents, and you get a feel for it from experience. What's relevant here is that the unstressed short vowel has a hard time holding its own against the preceding long, stressed vowel without help from another consonant; the terminal -t offers only very weak support.

The word intuit is the only word of this pattern that has kept that unstressed syllable. I think people continue to pronounce it because the words intuitive and intuition are much more common, so when people use the unusual verb intuit, they feel some pressure to echo the corresponding syllable in the familiar words in order to be understood. I have heard people attempt /ǐn.ˈtut/, independently inventing the word during conversation, and then draw back from it because it sounds weird and doesn't clearly indicate the connection with intuition. There is also pressure to avoid echoing the slightly silly verb ""toot"".

Since pronunciation is shaped by interaction between many pressures, if you pay attention to those pressures, you are in a good position to guess the pronunciations of unknown words.

Analogies, not rules

Some people harp on the fact that English spelling doesn't follow rules, as if this were proof that English is ""illogical"" or completely without order. Really, though, the English language works like English common law: by precedents, not rules. When deciding new cases, or when inventing new words, people try to be consistent with previous cases or with the spellings of words already in the language. Old cases and familiar words can't pre-decide every aspect of a new case, of course. Law and language accumulate over the centuries, one case and one word at a time, embodying subtlety and hopefully wisdom beyond what could be captured by any fully articulated system of rules.

As you get to know the language better, you can often guess pronunciation from spelling pretty accurately, especially with ""big"" words. When I was in the 2nd grade (age 7), I was given a test where I had to guess the pronunciations of a long list of words, up to ""college level"". I got nearly all of them right, despite not knowing, at that age, anything about etymological spelling—and despite not having encountered most of the words before. I could usually see some sort of analogy with a word I already knew, and I made an educated guess. That's how it works.

The moral of all this is that you should not memorize rules. You should not even memorize the few rules that happen to be true. Memorizing rules runs against the spirit of the language. What you should do is make analogies from specific words to specific words that you already know how to pronounce. Occasionally you'll guess wrong—and that will teach you a new precedent, which you will apply in new situations. Eventually, gradually, you learn to perceive English spellings with acuity. (You can probably guess that it's /ə.ˈcju.ĭ.tē/, despite the spelling's ambiguity, because of its congruity with annuity and gratuity.)

6049,6049,9599,Are mutliple database calls really significant with a network call for a web API?,"At one of my employers, we worked on a REST (but it also applies to SOAP) API. The client, which is the application UI, would make calls over the web (LAN in typical production deployments) to the API. The API would make calls to the database.

One theme that recurs in our discussions is performance: some people on the team believe that you should not have multiple database calls (usually reads) from a single API call because of performance; you should optimize them so that each API call has only (exactly) one database call.

But is that really important? Consider that the UI has to make a network call to the API; that's pretty big (order of magnitude of milliseconds). Databases are optimized to keep things in memory and execute reads very, very quickly (eg. SQL Server loads and keeps everything in RAM and consumes almost all your free RAM if it can).

TLDR: Is it really significant to worry about multiple database calls when we are already making a network call over the LAN? If so, why?

To be clear, I'm talking about order of magnitude -- I know that it depends on specifics (machine hardware, choice of API and DB, etc.) If I have a call that takes O(milliseconds), does optimizing for DB calls that take an order of magnitude less, actually matter? Or is there more to the problem than this?

Edit: for posterity, I think it's quite ridiculous to make claims that we need to improve performance by combining database calls under these circumstances -- especially with a lack of profiling. However, it's not my decision whether we do this or not; I want to know what the rationale is behind thinking this is a correct way of optimizing web API calls.

Yes! Obscure programming languages are still programming languages, and therefore questions about them are still on topic for Stack Overflow.

The notion that we might encourage or discourage questions about a particular language or technology strikes me as an utterly nonsensical one. If the questions meet our guidelines, then they are on topic. The only encouragement we do and need to provide is to ask questions that are constructive and on topic. If yours meet those requirements, proceed as desired.

",Dave,https://cooking.stackexchange.com/users/10938,"Gelatin sheets are soaked in cold-to-room-temp water in order to soften and rehydrate them slightly before stirring them into the (often hot) food. If you were to try to stir a sheet of gelatin directly into hot liquid, you'd find that it behaves a lot like cornstarch. It clumps up immediately and produces unpleasant-to-eat chunks that only a blender and a chinois have a hope of removing.

You squeeze it after soaking to remove excess (unflavored) water from the exterior. Otherwise, each sheet might bring along quite a bit of water, which will seriously affect the consistency of a product you expect to set up, and might affect the taste of even something like a braise to which you are adding the gelatin just for body.

",David B,https://stackoverflow.com/users/377031,"The author of this question mentions that it’s usually only after
MySQL prints its output that he realises that the the wrong query was executed.

will abort the current query – if you catch it before any output is
printed. For example:

MySQL gets busy generating the Cartesian Product of the above two tables and
you soon notice that MySQL hasn't printed any output to screen (the process

My first guess would be multithreading. For example, if you had your logic and render in the main loop, if logic takes a long time, you don't get anything rendered till it is done. With multiple threads, the render can be independant of the logic, and so evedn if the logic is bogged down, stuff still gets rendered, etc.

11,11,15,sleeping SPID blocking other transactions,"I'm really having trouble tracking down some blocking we are experiencing.

The root blocking SPID's status is 'sleeping', the cmd is 'AWAITING COMMAND', and the sqltext is 'SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ COMMITTED'.

When I view the Top Transactions by Blocked Transactions Count report, the Blocking SQL Statement is '--'.

I've performed a trace on the SQL and when the blocking happens tracing the root blocking SPID but it hasn't really led me anywhere.  The last trace statement is the same as the sqltext above 'SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ COMMITTED'.

I've checked all the related SPROCs I can find to make sure they have TRY/CATCH BEGIN TRAN/COMMIT TRAN/ROLLBACK TRAN statements (we use SPROCs for everything so there are no standalone statements being ran).  This issue just started happening over the last 24 hours and no one is claiming to have made any changes to the system.

Solution.  One of our seldomly used SPROCs had an error with an insert (number of columns didn't match), but we are still confused on what exactly was happening.

When looking at all the trace information, the EXEC statement for this SPROC was listed at times, but NEVER just before the BLOCK happened on the blockking SPID.  It seemed that when it starting blocking, the trace didn't record the execution of it (or any of the statements within it either).  However there are other times were the trace did record it's execution and no blocking occurred.

The SPROC error report came from a user, and I was able to find multiple EXEC statements in traces and run them in SSMS.  No time when I ran them did we have any blocking occur or did they hang.  They ran as expected (the catch block fired and rolled back the transaction after the error).  After resolving the fixing the SPROC, we have not seen the issue again.

The root blocking SPID's status is 'sleeping', the cmd is 'AWAITING COMMAND', and the sqltext is 'SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ COMMITTED'.

When I view the Top Transactions by Blocked Transactions Count report, the Blocking SQL Statement is '--'.

I've performed a trace on the SQL and when the blocking happens tracing the root blocking SPID but it hasn't really led me anywhere.  The last trace statement is the same as the sqltext above 'SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ COMMITTED'.

I've checked all the related SPROCs I can find to make sure they have TRY/CATCH BEGIN TRAN/COMMIT TRAN/ROLLBACK TRAN statements (we use SPROCs for everything so there are no standalone statements being ran).  This issue just started happening over the last 24 hours and no one is claiming to have made any changes to the system.

Solution.  One of our seldomly used SPROCs had an error with an insert (number of columns didn't match), but we are still confused on what exactly was happening.

When looking at all the trace information, the EXEC statement for this SPROC was listed at times, but NEVER just before the BLOCK happened on the blockking SPID.  It seemed that when it starting blocking, the trace didn't record the execution of it (or any of the statements within it either).  However there are other times were the trace did record it's execution and no blocking occurred.

The SPROC error report came from a user, and I was able to find multiple EXEC statements in traces and run them in SSMS.  No time when I ran them did we have any blocking occur or did they hang.  They ran as expected (the catch block fired and rolled back the transaction after the error).  After resolving the fixing the SPROC, we have not seen the issue again.

callCC f = Cont $ \k -&gt; runCont (f (\a -&gt; Cont $ \_ -&gt; k a)) k


Although this is not as simple as I want due to the Cont and runCont. I've also found descriptions of what it does, although never as clear as actual code.

So how is it implemented in its simplest form? I am tagging this with Scheme and Haskell as those are two languages I prefer.
",Pubby,https://stackoverflow.com/users/964135,"call/cc is trivial to implement. The hard part is setting up the environment where it is possible to implement.

We must first define a continuation-passing style (CPS) execution environment. In this environment, your functions (or function-like things) don't directly return values; instead, they are passed a function that represents the 'next step' in the computation - the 'continuation' - and they pass their result there. In Haskell, this looks like this:

newtype Cont r a = Cont { runCont :: (a -&gt; r) -&gt; r }


As you can see, a Cont monad action is really a function that takes a continuation (a -&gt; r), passes a result a to the continuation, and gets back a final result of r, which it simply passes through to its caller (ie, a Cont monad action should tail call into the continuation). runCont just takes it out of the newtype wrapper - you could also think of it as invoking an action with some particular continuation, as in runCont someAction someContinuation.

We can then turn this into a monad:

instance Monad (Cont r) where
    return x = Cont $ \cc -&gt; cc x
    (Cont f) (&gt;&gt;=) g = Cont $ \cc -&gt; f (\r -&gt; runCont (g r) cc)


As you can see, return just gets a continuation cc, and passes its value to the continuation. (&gt;&gt;=) is a bit trickier, it has to invoke f with a continuation that then invokes g, gets the action back, and then passes the outer continuation to this new action.

So given this framework, getting at the continuation is simple. We just want to invoke a function with its continuation twice. The tricky part is we need to rewrap this continuation in a new monadic action that throws out the existing continuation. So let's break it down a bit:

-- Invoke a raw continuation with a given argument, throwing away our normal 
-- continuation
gotoContinuation :: (a -&gt; r) -&gt; a -&gt; Cont r x
gotoContinuation continuation argument = Cont $ \_ -&gt; continuation argument

-- Duplicate the current continuation; wrap one up in an easy-to-use action, and
-- the other stays the normal continuation for f
callCC f = Cont $ \cc -&gt; runCont (f (gotoContinuation cc)) cc


Simple, no?

In other languages like Scheme, the principle is the same, although it may be implemented as a compiler primitive; the reason we can do it in Haskell is because the continuation-passing was something we defined in Haskell, not at a lower level of the runtime. But the principle is the same - you need to have CPS first, and then call/cc is a trivial application of this execution model.
