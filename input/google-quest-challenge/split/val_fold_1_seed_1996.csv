Because the Armadillo has the thick (I think it's Kevlar) weave, it doesn't flex as easily. This makes your tire want to ""skip"" off of objects, instead of flexing and rolling right over them.

I wanted to take advantage of the fact the lists were sorted, but I fear my efforts only served to render my code convoluted and inefficient. What do you think?

It is good to take advantage of the specification that the inputs are sorted. Overall you have done so nicely, but I have a few comments.

int[] foo, int[] bar


Please, oh please, no such variable names! I would prefer input1 and input2 or something like that. foo and bar are names which is okay to use in example code, but not in actual code like this.

The choice of choosing a Set&lt;Integer&gt; to store the results is not that optimal when you want the end result as a String. Here I would definitely go for StringBuilder, which also saves you the handling of an edge-case. In fact, I believe your current handling of intersection.isEmpty() isn't necessary either, as an empty set will have the toString value {} which thanks to your substring call will be converted to an empty string.

StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();
    ...
        if (result.length() &gt; 0) {
            result.append(',');
        }
        result.append(bar[j++]);

Also, this part can be simplified:

if (foo[i] &gt;= bar[j]) {

633,633,999,What is the best place to start Warhammer 40k?,"I've got three omnibus books containing 9 total Warhammer 40,000 stories.  Before I mention which ones I've got, which book would you recommend as a good place to start the series?
",jedihawk,https://scifi.stackexchange.com/users/58,"As someone who enjoyed playing the computer games, but not played the tabletop yet, these are my recommendations based on how I followed it.

First start with the Horus Heresy books; Horus Rising, False Gods etc. Then start Galaxy In Flames then The Flight of Eisenstein. After the first 2 books you would have what I believe is a reasonable grasp of the 40k universe with regards to the Imperium of Man v/s Chaos and why there are Traitor Legions within. You could then move on to discovering the other xenos aka Orks, Eldar etc. 

The books are a pretty easy read, but don't let that put anyone off as they are quite politically focused intertwined with some good narrative. 

However the downside, in the humblest of my opinions, is that I am starting to find the ""Imperium of Man"" is a bad organization.

Before I mention which books I have, which one would you recommend as a good place to start the series?","As someone who enjoyed playing the computer games, but not played the tabletop yet, these are my recommendations based on how I followed it.

First start with the Horus Heresy books; Horus Rising, False Gods etc. Then start Galaxy In Flames then The Flight of Eisenstein. After the first 2 books you would have what I believe is a reasonable grasp of the 40k universe with regards to the Imperium of Man v/s Chaos and why there are Traitor Legions within. You could then move on to discovering the other xenos aka Orks, Eldar etc. 

The books are a pretty easy read, but don't let that put anyone off as they are quite politically focused intertwined with some good narrative. 

However the downside, in the humblest of my opinions, is that I am starting to find the ""Imperium of Man"" is a bad organization. Especially with Horus being a Warmaster or have I read them wrong even before Heresy sets in. Of course Loken and his comrades are still good guys :). Maybe a spoiler there sorry :(

2253,2253,3591,Setting up a storage server to replace Dropbox,"We are a non-profit organisation in education sector dealing with a lot of external stakeholders including the government. As such, we work with a lot of documents every day including:


Office documents (Word, Excel, and PDF).
Large media files (photos and videos).


Our team often need to share documents with each other so we resort to Dropbox for file sharing AND backup. Office documents are okay, but problem arises when the media files got too big but aren't used as much, taking up bandwidth for nothing.

Is there a smarter and cheaper way to do this? A consultant advises us to use a VPN, so remote staffs can can log in to the server and download/upload documents. How would this affect the Internet connection in the office, especially when huge files are being transferred? Would it be possible to set different permission levels?
",Khairul,https://serverfault.com/users/57093,"Option 1 cheaper? probably: buy from a local computer shop a pc case and stuff it with hard drives and then get the FreeNAS OS installed and configured. For this you need someone with some medium knowledge of unix based OS.
Also, be sure to get the fastest harddrive you can...above 7500rpm...ideally would be a 10k rpm if you guys need fast access and transfer speed from withing the HQ network.

Option 2 smarter: buy a dedicated NAS Storage like the ones from QNAP or Synology of WD and many others. I dont know about the others, but the Synology NAS's have a build-in software called CloudStation which lets you create your own dropbox like storage (with some limitations like files above 10Gb wont get synced). I personally have a Synology DS1813+ at home and it's more then i asked for having my own cloudbased system that runs on android, linux and windows is great. Also, you can set it up a backup server, webdav server, caldav server, email server, DLNA server...basicaly anything you guys should need for the forseeable future.

Now, as for the internet bandwith, that'll be tricky, you need to start doing some math.
For example:
for 10 users - each user has a 1Mbit bandwith at home or on the road. not everyone is going to upload with 1Mbps to your NAS but there may be situations in which it might happen...in this case i sugest you upgrade you internet connection to a at least asyncronious 10 Mbps download/5 Mbps upload OR a syncronious one of 10/10 Download/Upload. In any case, the internet conectivity will be affected if you dont upgrade the internet bandwith. But you could set up speed limits in transfers on the NAS (talking here about the synology and PROBABLY the others also). Yes, every NAS system can let you set up permissions known as ACL Access Control Lists, to limit users from accessing classified data.

A VPN is the best idea, it help you encrypt the traffic between the client and the server - in this case the remote staff and the equipment that accepts VPN connections. BUT this would not be absolutely necessary in the following situation: with a synology NAS buy a SSL Certificate (or create one for free - search google for startssl.com) and setup the NAS to use that certificate encrypting this way all the traffic to and from the NAS.

For the local bandwith things get a little expensive (if they havent got there yet). To get the most of you NAS (either beeing a dedicated NAS or a home build one - assuming the home build one has a network card of 10/100/1000) you need Gigabit LAN connections. This means every switch from the computer that wants to transfer data to/from the NAS has to have gigabit capabilities. You can find out just by looking at the switch...it usualy has a sticker or some decal placed on it that says ""Gigabit""

Hope i shed some light :)
Good luck!

4170,4170,6648,"iPhone dock connector problems, with and without accessories","I started to experience problems with my iPhone that seem to be related to the dock connector.

Upon plugging my iPhone into my (officially supported) car stereo, I started to get the message  ""This accessory is not supported by iPhone"" on the screen.  Didn't think much of it as I only use it for charging purposes, and that still worked so I ignored it.  Then I bought a small ANT+ dongle, which is a little accessory you plug into the dock connector to allow your phone to receive data from various health/fitness devices like heart rate monitor, and cycle sensors etc.  It produces the same error message every time I plug it in, and the apps that use the dongle will not recognise it.

The dongle does officially support my hardware and OS level. I've checked that it is not broken by plugging it into an iPhone 5, an iPad 3 and an iPod of some description, none of which showed the error.  The supported apps find the device on the iPad, the iPhone 5 does not have the apps installed but offers to do so as soon as I plug it in, so I know the dongle is working correctly.

In addition to the above, when nothing is plugged into the dock connector, it still occassionally thinks that something is, resulting in a muted phone.  When it's in this state I am not able to hear anything or change any volume settings (music playback or ringer volume) with the physical keys. Going into the Music app shows that it thinks it's outputting the music to the dock connector.

Why is this accessory not working on my iPhone, and how can I get it working?  What causes my iPhone to think that it's docked when it isn't?
",stuffe,https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/9495,"This commonly occurs when there is an issue with your dock connector.  It is likely dirty, obstructed in some way, or possibly even broken with a bent pin or something.  Very often this is not apparent, because with 30 pins to play with, chances are most of the time you only need the ones for charging and USB data transfer, leaving the rest unused such that you will not notice if they start working sub optimally.

There are 3 ways I would try to fix this, in order of most likely to fix:

Clear it out

Your first step is to check for any obvious blockage.  If  you have a can of compressed air, you can try to blow any debris out.  If you don't, then using a fine non metallic scraper (a plastic toothpick is ideal, a wooden one may leave small fibers behind) carefully clean out what you can - even if it looks clean you will be surprised how much crap and fluff you can scrape out. Take care to blow any debris out of the phone, and not into it - i.e. hold it upright and get at it from underneath, don't sit it upside down and work from the top

Clean it up

If there is no obvious obstruction then the problem may be more subtle, a coating on one or more of the pins that is preventing a neat conductive contact, or is grounding a pin against another one for example - perhaps there has been some contact with a liquid in the past etc.  You need to clean the pins to get rid of this.  You will need a couple of things things - 1) some cleaning agent, 2) a lint free cloth/piece of sponge, or an old toothbrush.

For a cleaning agent, 99% isopropyl is perfect, but if you don't have that kicking around you could try a very small quantity of the neatest and purest alcoholic drink you have in the house - I've used Vodka which is by and large 50/50 alcohol and water.  Don't use anything flavoured or anything that it likely to have anything other than alcohol and water in it!  Especially sugars or salt!.

Using a very small amount of your cleaning agent, and keeping the phone upright so any drips fall out, and not into the phone, lightly brush or wipe the dock connector, taking care not to be rough enough to disturb the pins out of alignment.  I've used a small piece of synthetic sponge and prodded it about with the same toothpick I used earlier.

Hit it

If this doesn't work, then the issue could still be a physical obstruction, although it may be beyond the dock connector and more internal.  Short of taking the phone to bits, there is not a lot you can do, and whilst you cannot clean the inside, you can try to dislodge anything that's stuck by using a combination of lightly tapping the phone on all 4 sides whilst playing about with the vibrate functions for alarms etc.



Using the first 2 methods above I solved the ""Accessory not supported problem"", but still had the intermittent docking issue.

Assuming I could not fix that one, I went to turn on Vibrate alerts (which I had previously turned off) as a workaround, only to find that after playing with all the vibrate ""tones"" etc it magically fixed itself!


Note 1 It's possible that the issue is not with the connector on your phone, but on your device/cable - you can try all the above on the cable end too if doing it on your phone does not yield results.
Note 2 If your device is failing to charge, or will only charge from a certain cable or dock, then the same fix potentially applies.

",user3050386,https://stackoverflow.com/users/3050386,"Doing

fThread = std::thread( &amp;FileHandler::writeFile, this, pData );
fThread.join();


Is no different than doing

writeFile(pData);


This is because join() is going to block execution of the current thread and wait until the newly created thread returns before allowing the current thread to continue.

You can call detach() which will allow the thread to continue and the data will be written.

As far as what is the best way to write the data of the vector it depends on what size is it going to be and what behavior do you want.  You could make a copy if the vector is not that large and then write the copy to the file.  If the vector is going to be large then I would suggest either a std::lock_guard() or use an std::atomic type.  

As always you should profile to see which way is actually faster for you.

fThread = std::thread( &amp;FileHandler::writeFile, this, pData );
fThread.join();


Is no different than doing

writeFile(pData);


This is because join() is going to block execution of the current thread and wait until the newly created thread returns before allowing the current thread to continue.

You can call detach() which will allow the thread to continue and the data will be written.

As far as what is the best way to write the data of the vector it depends on what size is it going to be and what behavior do you want.  You could make a copy if the vector is not that large and then write the copy to the file.  If the vector is going to be large then I would suggest either a std::lock_guard() or use an std::atomic type.  

As always you should profile to see which way is actually faster for you.

I have a SQL PowerShell script in the works that calls out to the OS, invokes Foo.exe but needs to pass a command line parameter (the connection string). A SQL Agent job will exist on each instance, with a step of type PowerShell, that needs to know what the current context is. i.e. This execution began on DevIntegrated. 

I have no desire to have every script start with 

$thisInstance = ""Dev""


eespecially as I'd have to edit that as we migrate to environments (new servers and named instances) in the upcoming months.   

If I start SQLPS, I can determine my instance by slicing and dicing the results of Get-Location or running

When the SQL Agent starts a job of type PowerShell, it starts in the C:\windows\system32 The Get-Location route doesn't work as it's not in the SQLSERVER context. I can change into that context but I'll be at the ""root"" of SQL Server and won't know what instance I should be in. Using the Invoke-Sqlcmd route won't work either for same reason (technically, it times out as there is no default instance)

To the best of my knowledge, I've enumerated all the basic ""things"" I can Get into the job log but nothing seems to show SQLSERVER:\SQL\Server1\DevIntegrated

Get-Process seems like I could use that and some voodoo of trying to cobble things together by hitting the instances and matching spids but that just sounds like a bloody-hack from hell. There must be something basic that I'm missing, can anyone shed some light?

Alternatives to PowerShell investigated

I had investigated using other job types and didn't get a satisfactory resolution. Research indicated the PowerShell listed under SQL Agent was SQLPS and starting an instance of it by right clicking on the Agent automagically dropped me into the correct location. It was only when I pasted my interactive code into the job step that I learned of the difference as previously mentioned.

Job type of OS put me into an identical state in that I could not find a way to determine which instance dropped me into the command shell. Sure, I could sqlcmd and get the value of @@servername but if I knew what connection to start sqlcmd, I wouldn't need to to query the database ;)

TSQL could probably work if we enable xp cmdshell but I'm not sure if they have it turned on---government facility and they can be persnickety on non-default settings. Even then, I'm stuck futzing with dynamic SQL and losing a lot of the expressiveness and power that PowerShell lends.

While a bit ungainly, I thought defining a variable at the first step and passing that to successor steps but research turned up this article Handling Multiple Job Steps (BOL) 


""Job steps must be atomic. A job cannot pass Boolean values, data, or numeric values between job steps. You can pass values from one Transact-SQL job step to another by using permanent tables or global temporary tables. You can pass values from one CmdExec job step to another by using files.""


I can't use common tricks like a well-known file/environment variables/registry setting that Foo.exe looks for as that would prevent concurrent execution across instances.

1035,1035,1628,A family of polynomials with symmetric galois group,"Consider the following family of polynomials in $K[x,y]$, where $K$ has characteristic zero:

$f_n(x,y)=(x+y)^n+(x-1)y^n,$

for $n\geq 3$.  I can prove that $f_n(x,y)$ has an irreducible factor of degree $n-1$ in $x$. I also know that the galois group of $f_n$ over $K(y)$ is the symmetric group of degree $n-1$, but am having trouble proving this.

Here is an alternative form for $f_n$: make the substitution $x\rightarrow xy$ and divide by $y^n$.  this gives:

$g_n(x,y)=(x+1)^n+yx-1.$

Substituting $-n$ for $y$ in $g_n(x,y)$ we get:

$g_n(x,-n)=x^2h(x),$

where $h(x)$ is separable (EDIT: $h(x)$ is the subject of this question).

Alternatively, substituting $x\rightarrow x-1$ into $g_n(x,y)$ gives us a polynomial which factors as:

$(x-1)(x^{n-1}+x^{n-2}+\ldots +x^2+x+y+1)$

It seems as though it shouldn't be hard to show that some specialisation of $y$ into this gives a polynomial with galois group $S_{n-1}$ over $K$...but I'm well and truly stuck.

Any advice much appreciated! 
",MrB,https://mathoverflow.net/users/2189,"[Edited mostly to incorporate references etc. from Michael Zieve]

The polynomial $(x^n-1)/(x-1) - y$ has Galois group $S_{n-1}$ over ${\bf C}(y)$ for each $n$, as expected.  This answers one of the three problems; the question statements asserts that they are equivalent, which doesn't seem to be the case (see my comment there), so I hope I'm answering the intended one.

The proof combines group theory and polynomial algebra (as might be expect) with algebraic topology, which might be a bit less expected.  The connection is as follows.  Let $S$ be the Riemann sphere with coordinate $y$, let $P(x,y)$ be any polynomial of degree $d&gt;0$ in $x$, and let $S'$ be the Riemann surface corresponding to $P(x,y)=0$.  The rational function $y$ on $S'$ gives a map $S' \rightarrow S$; let $B = \lbrace y_1,\ldots,y_b\rbrace$ be its set of branch points, and fix some $\eta \in S$ not in $B$.  Then $\pi_1(S-B,\phantom.\eta)$ is a free group on $b-1$ generators, with generators $g_1,\ldots,g_b$ (where each $g_j$ is a loop from the base point $\eta$ around $y_j$ and back to $\eta$) subject to the single relation $g_1 g_2 \cdots g_b = 1$.  These lift to automorphisms $\tilde g_j$ of $S' - y^{-1}(B)$ such that $y = y \cdot \tilde g_j$, and thus to permutations $\pi_j$ of the $d$ sheets of $S'$ above $S$.  Then the key fact is that


  The Galois group of $P(x,y)$ as a polynomial over ${\bf C}(y)$ is the subgroup of $S_d$ generated by the permutations $\pi_j$.


In our case $P\phantom.$ has the form $p(x) - y$.  In general I think it is known which polynomials (or even rational functions) $p$ yield $p(x)-y$ with Galois group other than $S_d$, but it's not easy and involves the classification of finite simple groups!
[Actually even less is known; the groups have been determined, but the polynomials, not quite, even in the polynomial case.  See below.  But this is tangential to the question at hand (albeit a fascinating tangent) because the ensuing argument is enough.]
Fortunately in our case the following sufficient condition is all we need:


  Let $p\in {\bf C}[X]$ be a polynomial of degree $d$.  Assume that the derivative $p'$ has distinct roots $x_1,\ldots,x_{d-1}$, and that the numbers $y_j = p(x_j)$ are also pairwise distinct.  Then $p(x)-y$ has Galois group $S_d$ over ${\bf C}(y)$.


[Naturally this result is not new, but I was still surprised to learn from Mike Zieve of its true age and pedigree: Hilbert (1892)!  See below.]

Proof: Here $b=d$ and the branch points are $y_1,\ldots,y_{d-1}$ and $y_d = \infty$.  Since $P$ is a polynomial, $\pi_d$ is a $d$-cycle.  (This already proves that the Galois group is transitive, that is, that the polynomial is irreducible; but we already knew this because it is obviously irreducible over ${\bf C}[y]$.)  Each $\pi_j$ for $j&lt;d$ is a simple transposition.  So we have $d-1$ transpositions whose product is a $d$-cycle.  But we readily prove the following by induction on $d$:


  Let $s_1,\ldots,s_{d-1}$ be $d-1$ simple transpositions of $d$ letters.  Then TFAE: (i) $s_1 s_2 \cdots s_{d-1}$ is a $d$-cycle; (ii) $s_1,\ldots,s_{d-1}$ generate a transitive subgroup of $S_d$; (iii) $s_1,\ldots,s_{d-1}$ generate $S_d$; (iv) the graph on $d$ vertices in which two vertices are adjacent iff they're permuted by some $s_j$ is a tree.


Here (i) is satisfied, so (iii) holds and the Galois group is $S_d$ as claimed.

[NB we cannot drop the condition that the $y_j$ be distinct; e.g. the Čebyšev polynomial $T_d$ has dihedral Galois group, which is smaller than $S_d$ once $d&gt;3$, even though $T'_d$ has distinct roots $x_j$, because $T_d(x_j) = \pm 1$ for each of them.]

It remains to check that the hypothesis on $p$ is satisfied when $d=n-1$ and $p=(X^n-1)/(X-1)$.  For lack of a better idea I did this by computing the discriminant of the polynomial
$$
q(y) = \frac{(n-1)^{n-1} y^n - n^n (y-1)^{n-1}}{(y-n)^2} \qquad (1)
$$
of degree $n-2$ whose roots are the $y_j$, and checking that it is nonzero; in fact
$$
\mathop{\rm disc} q(y) = \pm 2 \Delta_{n-1} \Delta_n
$$
where $\Delta_m := m^{(m-1)(m-3)}$ (and the sign depends on $n \bmod 4$).  The formula for $q$ was obtained from the familiar expression $\pm \bigl( (n-1)^{n-1} A^n - n^n B^{n-1} \bigr)$ for the discriminant of the trinomial $x^n - Ax + B$.  It follows that the numerator of (1) is $\pm$ the discriminant of $x^n - xy + (y-1) = (x-1) (p(x)-y)$ as a polynomial in $x$, whence (1) soon follows; substituting $y = nz/(nz-(n-1))$, and using the covariance of the discriminant under ${\rm PGL}_2$ together with the same trinomial formula, soon gives the claimed $\pm 2 \Delta_{n-1} \Delta_n$ (the factor of $2$ arises at the end from a double application of L'H&ocirc;pital's rule), QED.

Here are some relevant references and additional information.

Polynomials with distinct critical values: This is in section 4.4 of Serre's Topics in Galois Theory (Boston: Jones &amp; Bartlett 1992), as is the reference to Hilbert: ""Ueber die irreduzibilität genzen rationalen Funktionen mit ganzzahligen Koeffizienten"", J. reine angew. Math. (""Crelle's J."") 110, 104-129 (= Ges. Abh. II, 264-286).  Serre gives such polynomials the suggestive name ""Morse functions"". M. Zieve also notes that a 1959 paper by Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer in Acta Arith. (MR0113844 (22 #4675)) attributes to Davenport the equivalent formulation


  [The Galois group of $f(x) = y$] is the symmetric group if the discriminant of the discriminant of $f(x)-y$ does not vanish.


They call this a ""more euphonious form""; that's a matter of taste, but at any rate it's a memorable formulation, and the one that ended up being used here.

Exceptional Galois groups of $p(x) = y$.  The primitive groups that can occur are described by Peter Müller in a paper Primitive monodromy groups of polynomials.  They are the symmetric and alternating groups, plus cyclic and dihedral groups (for polynomials equivalent to powers and Čebyšev), and a finite but substantial list of exceptional possibilities.  It is hopeless to classify all cases of alternating Galois group.  For the rest it can be done, but not easily.  Some are exhibited by Cassou-Nogues and Couveignes in an Acta Arith. paper Factorisations explicites de $g(y)-h(z)$; most others were done by Mike Zieve himself; and the final case, polynomials of degree $23$ with Galois group the Mathieu group $M_{23}$, I computed only a few days ago after Mike noted it was still open (they're defined over the quadratic extension of ${\bf Q}(\sqrt{-23})$ of discriminant $3 \cdot 23^3$).

When $p$ is allowed to be a rational function, even the list of groups is not yet known.  Mike notes that this ""ties in with the 'genus zero program' initiated by Guralnick and Thompson"" that was completed in a 2001 paper by Frohardt and Magaard in the Annals of Math.

$f_n(x,y)=(x+y)^n+(x-1)y^n,$

for $n\geq 3$.  I can prove that $f_n(x,y)$ has an irreducible factor of degree $n-1$ in $x$. I also know that the galois group of $f_n$ over $K(y)$ is the symmetric group of degree $n-1$, but am having trouble proving this.

Here is an alternative form for $f_n$: make the substitution $x\rightarrow xy$ and divide by $y^n$.  this gives:

$g_n(x,y)=(x+1)^n+yx-1.$

Substituting $-n$ for $y$ in $g_n(x,y)$ we get:

$g_n(x,-n)=x^2h(x),$

where $h(x)$ is separable (EDIT: $h(x)$ is the subject of this question).

Alternatively, substituting $x\rightarrow x-1$ into $g_n(x,y)$ gives us a polynomial which factors as:

$(x-1)(x^{n-1}+x^{n-2}+\ldots +x^2+x+y+1)$

It seems as though it shouldn't be hard to show that some specialisation of $y$ into this gives a polynomial with galois group $S_{n-1}$ over $K$...but I'm well and truly stuck.

Any advice much appreciated! 
","[Edited mostly to incorporate references etc. from Michael Zieve]

The polynomial $(x^n-1)/(x-1) - y$ has Galois group $S_{n-1}$ over ${\bf C}(y)$ for each $n$, as expected.  This answers one of the three problems; the question statements asserts that they are equivalent, which doesn't seem to be the case (see my comment there), so I hope I'm answering the intended one.

The proof combines group theory and polynomial algebra (as might be expect) with algebraic topology, which might be a bit less expected.  The connection is as follows.  Let $S$ be the Riemann sphere with coordinate $y$, let $P(x,y)$ be any polynomial of degree $d&gt;0$ in $x$, and let $S'$ be the Riemann surface corresponding to $P(x,y)=0$.  The rational function $y$ on $S'$ gives a map $S' \rightarrow S$; let $B = \lbrace y_1,\ldots,y_b\rbrace$ be its set of branch points, and fix some $\eta \in S$ not in $B$.  Then $\pi_1(S-B,\phantom.\eta)$ is a free group on $b-1$ generators, with generators $g_1,\ldots,g_b$ (where each $g_j$ is a loop from the base point $\eta$ around $y_j$ and back to $\eta$) subject to the single relation $g_1 g_2 \cdots g_b = 1$.  These lift to automorphisms $\tilde g_j$ of $S' - y^{-1}(B)$ such that $y = y \cdot \tilde g_j$, and thus to permutations $\pi_j$ of the $d$ sheets of $S'$ above $S$.  Then the key fact is that


  The Galois group of $P(x,y)$ as a polynomial over ${\bf C}(y)$ is the subgroup of $S_d$ generated by the permutations $\pi_j$.


In our case $P\phantom.$ has the form $p(x) - y$.  In general I think it is known which polynomials (or even rational functions) $p$ yield $p(x)-y$ with Galois group other than $S_d$, but it's not easy and involves the classification of finite simple groups!
[Actually even less is known; the groups have been determined, but the polynomials, not quite, even in the polynomial case.  See below.  But this is tangential to the question at hand (albeit a fascinating tangent) because the ensuing argument is enough.]
Fortunately in our case the following sufficient condition is all we need:


  Let $p\in {\bf C}[X]$ be a polynomial of degree $d$.  Assume that the derivative $p'$ has distinct roots $x_1,\ldots,x_{d-1}$, and that the numbers $y_j = p(x_j)$ are also pairwise distinct.  Then $p(x)-y$ has Galois group $S_d$ over ${\bf C}(y)$.


[Naturally this result is not new, but I was still surprised to learn from Mike Zieve of its true age and pedigree: Hilbert (1892)!  See below.]

Proof: Here $b=d$ and the branch points are $y_1,\ldots,y_{d-1}$ and $y_d = \infty$.  Since $P$ is a polynomial, $\pi_d$ is a $d$-cycle.  (This already proves that the Galois group is transitive, that is, that the polynomial is irreducible; but we already knew this because it is obviously irreducible over ${\bf C}[y]$.)  Each $\pi_j$ for $j&lt;d$ is a simple transposition.  So we have $d-1$ transpositions whose product is a $d$-cycle.  But we readily prove the following by induction on $d$:


  Let $s_1,\ldots,s_{d-1}$ be $d-1$ simple transpositions of $d$ letters.  Then TFAE: (i) $s_1 s_2 \cdots s_{d-1}$ is a $d$-cycle; (ii) $s_1,\ldots,s_{d-1}$ generate a transitive subgroup of $S_d$; (iii) $s_1,\ldots,s_{d-1}$ generate $S_d$; (iv) the graph on $d$ vertices in which two vertices are adjacent iff they're permuted by some $s_j$ is a tree.


Here (i) is satisfied, so (iii) holds and the Galois group is $S_d$ as claimed.

[NB we cannot drop the condition that the $y_j$ be distinct; e.g. the Čebyšev polynomial $T_d$ has dihedral Galois group, which is smaller than $S_d$ once $d&gt;3$, even though $T'_d$ has distinct roots $x_j$, because $T_d(x_j) = \pm 1$ for each of them.]

It remains to check that the hypothesis on $p$ is satisfied when $d=n-1$ and $p=(X^n-1)/(X-1)$.  For lack of a better idea I did this by computing the discriminant of the polynomial
$$
q(y) = \frac{(n-1)^{n-1} y^n - n^n (y-1)^{n-1}}{(y-n)^2} \qquad (1)
$$
of degree $n-2$ whose roots are the $y_j$, and checking that it is nonzero; in fact
$$
\mathop{\rm disc} q(y) = \pm 2 \Delta_{n-1} \Delta_n
$$
where $\Delta_m := m^{(m-1)(m-3)}$ (and the sign depends on $n \bmod 4$).  The formula for $q$ was obtained from the familiar expression $\pm \bigl( (n-1)^{n-1} A^n - n^n B^{n-1} \bigr)$ for the discriminant of the trinomial $x^n - Ax + B$.  It follows that the numerator of (1) is $\pm$ the discriminant of $x^n - xy + (y-1) = (x-1) (p(x)-y)$ as a polynomial in $x$, whence (1) soon follows; substituting $y = nz/(nz-(n-1))$, and using the covariance of the discriminant under ${\rm PGL}_2$ together with the same trinomial formula, soon gives the claimed $\pm 2 \Delta_{n-1} \Delta_n$ (the factor of $2$ arises at the end from a double application of L'H&ocirc;pital's rule), QED.

Here are some relevant references and additional information.

Polynomials with distinct critical values: This is in section 4.4 of Serre's Topics in Galois Theory (Boston: Jones &amp; Bartlett 1992), as is the reference to Hilbert: ""Ueber die irreduzibilität genzen rationalen Funktionen mit ganzzahligen Koeffizienten"", J. reine angew. Math. (""Crelle's J."") 110, 104-129 (= Ges. Abh. II, 264-286).  Serre gives such polynomials the suggestive name ""Morse functions"". M. Zieve also notes that a 1959 paper by Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer in Acta Arith. (MR0113844 (22 #4675)) attributes to Davenport the equivalent formulation


  [The Galois group of $f(x) = y$] is the symmetric group if the discriminant of the discriminant of $f(x)-y$ does not vanish.


They call this a ""more euphonious form""; that's a matter of taste, but at any rate it's a memorable formulation, and the one that ended up being used here.

Exceptional Galois groups of $p(x) = y$.  The primitive groups that can occur are described by Peter Müller in a paper Primitive monodromy groups of polynomials.  They are the symmetric and alternating groups, plus cyclic and dihedral groups (for polynomials equivalent to powers and Čebyšev), and a finite but substantial list of exceptional possibilities.  It is hopeless to classify all cases of alternating Galois group.  For the rest it can be done, but not easily.  Some are exhibited by Cassou-Nogues and Couveignes in an Acta Arith. paper Factorisations explicites de $g(y)-h(z)$; most others were done by Mike Zieve himself; and the final case, polynomials of degree $23$ with Galois group the Mathieu group $M_{23}$, I computed only a few days ago after Mike noted it was still open (they're defined over the quadratic extension of ${\bf Q}(\sqrt{-23})$ of discriminant $3 \cdot 23^3$).

When $p$ is allowed to be a rational function, even the list of groups is not yet known.  Mike notes that this ""ties in with the 'genus zero program' initiated by Guralnick and Thompson"" that was completed in a 2001 paper by Frohardt and Magaard in the Annals of Math.

5776,5776,9153,Information to include with a fine art print?,"I am just beginning to sell some of my images and would like to personalize them a little.  Many photographers sign and title their work on the white space just below the printed image. I am having metal prints made so there is no matting or white space, so I considered printing small (2""x3.5"") stickers to place on the back of the images. What information do you think should be included on that sticker? Pretty much everything I've found online talks about a certificate of authenticity and limited editions. I do not want limited editions but would like to sign and number my larger prints. Does anyone have experience with this? Do I need to print a separate certificate? At this juncture my sticker will have my logo, image title, artist name (me), place for my signature and date, ""edition #xx of an open edition"". Some sites mention including the date the photograph was taken; format (i.e. 24""x36"" photographic print on metal), though it seems redundant since it will be on the back of the print; same goes for description of artwork, as well as copyright as I am signing and dating it. I do plan on printing a second sticker with care instructions (i.e. hang indoors and out of direct sunlight etc.).  

Revision to clarify:
What information should be included? Do I need to put copyright information if I am signing it? Is it necessary to include the format of the print or the shot on date?  Should I also be providing a certificate of authenticity?

Thank you!

Even though these tires are not really puncture proof, they do reduce a lot the chances of puncturing. So the advantage is obvious.

Apparently, they're not too expensive compared to regular tires. So, I was wondering why people would choose not to use these more resistant tires. What are their disadvantages?
",b.roth,https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/users/131,"Though there no doubt are ""puncture-resistant"" tires that seek to accomplish that end by means of extra-thick rubber, for the past 15-20 years the standard for puncture resistance has been Kevlar belted tires, which look and ride like ordinary tires and weight essentially the same as ordinary tires (maybe a few grams more). 

The Kevlar belt under the tread increases puncture resistance by at least a factor 10, eliminating most common glass/thorn punctures, and also reducing the tendency of the tire to ""bruise"".

Price wise, my recollection is that they are about 30% more expensive than standard tires, but they likely last that much longer (plus save a lot on tubes), so the cost is pretty much a wash.  (The odd thing is that Kevlar-belted tires are so hard to find.)

Some people apparently confuse ""Kevlar belted"" tires with ""Kevlar bead"" tires.  The latter are ""folding"" tires and are supposedly desired because they are a hair lighter than metal bead tires, plus they can be folded and stuffed in a pannier.  But you can buy Kevlar belted with a metal bead (my preference, since folding tires are a PITA to install), and Kevlar bead tires are not necessarily Kevlar belted (in fact, most often not).

Update:  Last Saturday I had my first puncture in maybe 5 years (maybe 2000 miles), while finishing up a 35-mile morning.  Just got around to fixing it because it's been ungodly hot and humid. (Hitched a ride home the last two miles, since there was no way to fix the flat in 95-degree weather on a 4-foot shoulder in the sun with traffic whizzing by at 70 MPH.)

The culprit was apparently a construction staple that had pierced the tire just outside the belt, gone through the sidewall of the tube, and then punched a bigger hole in the inside diameter of the tube.

I do notice the tire is wearing a bit thin, so I'll probably have to replace it within a year or so.  I'm dreading trying to find a 700/35c road tire with Kevlar belt, though -- the catalogs are now full of off-road tires and cater even less to the touring market than they did 5-10 years ago.

5996,5996,9507,How do I change the default checkerboard blocksize in OpenCV,"I'm currently experimenting with OpenCV's calibration toolbox and I'm using a default checkerboard pattern to calibrate a camera. I want to use larger checkerboard blocks so that I can stand farther away from the camera without affecting OpenCV's ability to detect the corners.

As I understand it, OpenCV is pre-programmed with default block-size values. My question is: is there a way to change this default block-size value in the code? And where would I change this? TIA
",Yassie,https://stackoverflow.com/users/3081770,"OpenCV does not make any assumption on the physical size or the pattern size of your pattern.

That is, you can have any pattern with R rows and C columns.
It also doesn't matter if each block is 1 cm or 1 m.

The only thing you give to the calibrateCamera function is the objectPoints and imagePoints.

The array-dimensions (sizes) of these parameters corresponds to the number of corners of your pattern.

objectPoints should contain 3D coordinates (well, planar coordinates in your case, by setting Z=0) of your checkboard corners. These corners should be scaled to the physical size of your checkerboard. That is, if a corner has row-column index (3,1) and each block side is 3 cm then the 3D coordinate would be (0.09, 0.03, 0.00).

As far as I can google, dd-wrt shares files through SAMBA. I know it's not the prefered option for Ubuntu users and we would prefer NFS, but does anyone know how bad or good it is this setup?

",Ricardo Reyes,https://askubuntu.com/users/94,"If you just want to rsync to it, you can run it over ssh.

You can also browse files over SSH, even mount it permanently. For just moving files around, it's a bit slower and resource intensive than plain samba or NFS but for running rsyncd, it should be fine.

NFS isn't compiled into the dd-wrt kernel so if you want to use it, you need to use the userspace version which is somewhat slower.

Routers don't tend to be the best fileservers. They have a great networking stack but the interface between the router and the drive is pretty slow. On top of that CPU overhead that wouldn't be noticed on a proper server can cause a little router quite a lot of stress.

There are also possible security ramifications of running a precious service like a fileserver on something with a direct connection to the wild.

3095,3095,4930,How does multitasking work,"I am completely clueless about the inner workings of an operating system, but I can more or less guess the approximate behaviour of many functions. One thing that I am not able to figure out, though, is multitasking.

In theory, the operating system manages time, according the CPU for small intervals to the various programs running. But it is not clear how this really works.

Say the operating system wants to start my program. The machine code is loaded somewhere in RAM, starting at a certain address. I guess then a jump should be performed to that address, allowing my code to execute. But in this way, the OS cannot regain control until I jump back.

Basically, I can imagine just two ways of making this work, but neither seems really suitable:


The operating system could read the machine instructions I want to perform and emulate them instead of executing them directly. I am intentionally vague, since I do not know how this would work, but it seems like it would slow down the program considerably.
Alternatively, the operating system could wait until I make a system call. In that moment it regains control and can check how long I have been running and do its timesharing stuff. This may work, but it seems unreliable, as I could make a long calculation which does not involve system calls and hang everything for a while.


So, it seems neither mechanism would work very well. How is multitasking actually performed?

For example lets say we are trying to mount a filesystem in a computer with ip 10.0.0.55 and our computer where we going to be executing the mount is 10.0.0.40

so when you do the command the destination port (ie the port 10.0.0.55 is listening ) is fine but when you do the command the source port is randomly generated by the os and that is the port 10.0.0.55 uses to reply back to the other pc that pc is behind a router so there have to be an specific port

Any ideas I have tried modifying where the function bindresvport() is called and binding that socket to an specific port but it doesnt seem to work

As an advanced beginner, I don't understand this rule at all.

As such, I frequently need to pause and calculate what to play, even in situations where the correct play should be obvious. 

Knowing that I will inevitably need to pause and consider a play and that that pause will provide my opponents with the information that I had a potentially difficult decision to make, why is it considered unethical for me to occasionally insert a similar pause before a routine play?

4807,4807,7637,Can std::unique_ptr be used as an argument?,"Now, I'm just studying about smart_ptr (unique_ptr / shared_ptr). And I wrote test code like this for checking unique_ptr can be used as argument.

typedef struct __T_TEST
{
char cT1;
char cT2;
} T_TEST;

int main(...)
{
...
char szB[2] = {0x61, 0x62};

auto pTest = std::make_unique&lt;T_TEST&gt;();
std::memcpy(pTest, szB, 2);
printf(""T1 = [%02x]\n"", pTest-&gt;cT1);
printf(""T2 = [%02x]\n"", pTest-&gt;cT2);

return 0;
}


And then, I added one function using unique_ptr as parameter like this.

int TestPrint(std::unique_ptr&lt;T_TEST&gt; p_pData)
{
    printf(""T1 in TestPrint Func = [%02x]\n"", p_pData-&gt;cT1);
    printf(""T2 in TestPrint Func = [%02x]\n"", p_pData-&gt;cT2);
    return 0;

I'm just calling that function in main function after printf. But it doesn't work.

printf(""T1 = [%02x]\n"", pTest-&gt;cT1);
printf(""T2 = [%02x]\n"", pTest-&gt;cT2);

TestPrint(pTest);  &lt;- Can't pass the pTest!

return 0;
}


In this case, I can't pass the pTest. Why not? I think pTest is std::unique_ptr and p_pData is std::unique_ptr in TestPrint function. So it's the same type!! But I can't. I want to know why it doesn't work.

Of course, it can work after changing the function to std::unique_ptr&lt;T_TEST&gt;&amp; p_pData. But I don't understand why I can't pass the parameter despite of same data type.
",je-woong.ku,https://stackoverflow.com/users/3788932,"std::unique_ptr is a move only type(cannot be copied), if you want to pass it in to the function as a parameter, you can

2 : move it

TestPrint(std::move(pTest));


3 : do not use unique_ptr as parameter, use pointer

    printf(""T2 in TestPrint Func = [%02x]\n"", p_pData-&gt;cT2);
    return 0;
}

TestPrint(pTest.get());


Pointer is bad at resource management, but good at access resource, if you do not need to pass the ownership to the function, you can use pointer to replace unique_ptr, this is more flexible IMHO, because the raw pointer can work with shared_ptr, unique_ptr, weal_ptr and other smart pointer, but unique_ptr must work with unique_ptr only.

In most cases, I only use smart pointer as a function parameter when I want to share(std::shared_ptr) or transfer ownership(std::unique_ptr).

And I wrote test code like this for checking unique_ptr can be used as argument.

typedef struct __T_TEST

char cT1;
char cT2;
} T_TEST;

int main(...)
{
...
char szB[2] = {0x61, 0x62};

auto pTest = std::make_unique&lt;T_TEST&gt;();

printf(""T1 = [%02x]\n"", pTest-&gt;cT1);
printf(""T2 = [%02x]\n"", pTest-&gt;cT2);

}


And then, I added one function using unique_ptr as parameter like this.

int TestPrint(std::unique_ptr&lt;T_TEST&gt; p_pData)
{
    printf(""T1 in TestPrint Func = [%02x]\n"", p_pData-&gt;cT1);
    printf(""T2 in TestPrint Func = [%02x]\n"", p_pData-&gt;cT2);

I'm just calling that function in main function after printf. But it doesn't work.

printf(""T1 = [%02x]\n"", pTest-&gt;cT1);
printf(""T2 = [%02x]\n"", pTest-&gt;cT2);

TestPrint(pTest);  &lt;- Can't pass the pTest!

In this case, I can't pass the pTest. Why not? I think pTest is std::unique_ptr and p_pData is std::unique_ptr in TestPrint function. So it's the same type!! But I can't. I want to know why it doesn't work.

Of course, it can work after changing the function to std::unique_ptr&lt;T_TEST&gt;&amp; p_pData. But I don't understand why I can't pass the parameter despite of same data type.
","std::unique_ptr is a move only type(cannot be copied), if you want to pass it in to the function as a parameter, you can

1 : pass by reference

{
    printf(""T1 in TestPrint Func = [%02x]\n"", p_pData-&gt;cT1);
    printf(""T2 in TestPrint Func = [%02x]\n"", p_pData-&gt;cT2);
    return 0;
}


2 : move it

TestPrint(std::move(pTest));


3 : do not use unique_ptr as parameter, use pointer

int TestPrint(T_TEST *p_pData)
{
    printf(""T1 in TestPrint Func = [%02x]\n"", p_pData-&gt;cT1);
    printf(""T2 in TestPrint Func = [%02x]\n"", p_pData-&gt;cT2);

5336,5336,8477,How can I detect a power outage with a microcontroller?,"I have the following power supply configuration:
AC MAINS -> UPS -> 24V POWER SUPPLY -> 5V VOLTAGE REGULATOR -> PCB (microcontroller).
What's the best solution to detect the power outage on the mains with the microcontroller?
I also need to detect the zero-crossing so that I can control the speed of an AC motor.
",m.Alin,https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/4906,"Since you also need the zero-crossing you'll get the power outage detection virtually for free.
Best is to use an optocoupler to detect zero-crossings. Put the mains voltage via high resistance resistors to the input of the optocoupler. Vishay's SFH6206 has two LEDs in anti-parallel, so it works over the full cycle of the mains voltage.  



If the input voltage is high enough the output transistor is switched on, and the collector is at a low level. Around the zero crossing, however, the input voltage is too low to activate the output transistor and its collector will be pulled high. So you get a positive pulse at every zero crossing. The pulse width depends on the LEDs' current. Never mind if it's more than 10% duty cycle (1ms at 50Hz). It will be symmetrical about the actual zero-crossing, so the exact point is in the middle of the pulse.   

To detect power outages you (re)start a timer on every zero-crossing, with a timeout at 2.5 half cycles. Best practice is to let the pulse generate an interrupt. As long as the power is present the timer will be restarted every half cycle and never time out. Upon a power outage however, it will timeout after a bit longer than a cycle, and you can take the appropriate action. (The timeout value is longer than 2 half cycles, so that a spike on 1 zero-crossing causing a missed pulse won't give you a false warning.)
If you create a software timer it won't cost you anything, but you can also use a retriggerable monostable multivibrator (MMV), for instance with an LM555.  

note: depending on your mains voltage and the resistor type you may need to place two resistors in series for the optocoupler, because the high voltage may cause a single resistor to breakdown. For 230V AC I've used three 1206 resistors in series for this.  



Q &amp; A time! (from comments, this is extra, in case you want more)  

Q: And the input LEDs of the optocoupler will work at 230V? The datasheet states that the forward voltage is 1.65V.
A: Like for a common diode the voltage over a LED is more or less constant, no matter what your supply voltage is. The mandatory series resistor will take the voltage difference between power supply and LED voltage. The answers to this question explain how to calculate the resistor's value. Extreme example: a 10 000V power supply for a 2V LED. Voltage over the resistor: 10 000V - 2V = 9 998V. You want 20mA? Then the resistor is \$\frac{9 998V}{20mA}\$ = 499.9k\$\Omega\$. That's 500k, that's even reasonable. Yet, you can't use an ordinary resistor here. Why not? Firstly, a common 1/4W PTH resistor is rated at 250V, and will definitely breakdown at 10 000V, so you'll have to use 40 resistors in series to distribute the high voltage. Secondly, and worse, the power that the resistor would have to dissipate is \$P = V \times I = 9 998V \times 20mA = 199.96W\$, a lot more than the rated 1/4W. So to cope with the power we'll even need 800 resistors. OK, 10kV is extreme, but the example shows that you can use any voltage for a LED, so 230V is also possible. It's just a matter of using enough and the right type of resistors.  

Q: How does the reverse voltage affect the lifetime of the LEDs?
A: The second, anti-parallel LED takes care of that by ensuring that the reverse voltage over the other LED can't become higher than its own forward voltage. And that's a good thing, because a reverse voltage of 325V\$_P\$ would kill any LED (most likely explode), just like any signal diode, by the way. The best way to protect it is a diode in anti-parallel.  

Q: Won't the resistors dissipate a lot of heat?
A: Well, let's see. If we assume 1mA through the resistors and ignore the LED voltage, we have \$P = V \times I = 230V_{RMS} \times 1mA = 230mW\$, so even a 1206 can handle that. And remember, we're using more than 1 resistor, so we're safe if we can work with 1mA (The SFH6206 has a high CTR \$-\$ Current Transfer Ratio).

A: The second, anti-parallel LED takes care of that by ensuring that the reverse voltage over the other LED can't become higher than its own forward voltage. And that's a good thing, because a reverse voltage of 325V\$_P\$ would kill any LED (most likely explode), just like any signal diode, by the way. The best way to protect it is a diode in anti-parallel.  

Q: Won't the resistors dissipate a lot of heat?
A: Well, let's see. If we assume 1mA through the resistors and ignore the LED voltage, we have \$P = V \times I = 230V_{RMS} \times 1mA = 230mW\$, so even a 1206 can handle that. And remember, we're using more than 1 resistor, so we're safe if we can work with 1mA (The SFH6206 has a high CTR \$-\$ Current Transfer Ratio).

5752,5752,9108,Why is polyploidy lethal for some organisms while for others is not?,"Polyploidy is the multiplication of number of chromosomal sets from 2n to 3n (triploidy), 4n (tetraploidy) and so on. It is quite common in plants, for example many crops like wheat or Brassica forms. It seems to be rarer in animals but still it is present among some amphibian species like Xenopus.

As I know in mammals polyploidy is lethal (I don't mean tissue - limited polyploidy). I understand that triploidy is harmful due to stronger influence of maternal or paternal epigenetic traits that cause abnormal development of placenta, but why there is no tetraploid mammals?
",Marta Cz-C,https://biology.stackexchange.com/users/68,"Great question, and one about which there has historically been a lot of speculation, and there is currently a lot of misinformation. I will first address the two answers given by other users, which are both incorrect but have been historically suggested by scientists. Then I will try to explain the current understanding (which is not simple or complete). My answer is derived directly from the literature, and in particular from Mable (2004), which in turn is part of the 2004 special issue of the Biological Journal of the Linnean Society tackling the subject.

The 'sex' answer...

In 1925 HJ Muller addressed this question in a famous paper, ""Why polyploidy is rarer in animals than in plants"" (Muller, 1925). Muller briefly described the phenomenon that polyploidy was frequently observed in plants, but rarely in animals. The explanation, he said, was simple (and is approximate to that described in Matthew Piziak's answer):


  animals usually have two sexes which are differentiated by means of a process involving the diploid mechanism of segregation and combination whereas plants-at least the higher plants-are usually hermaphroditic.


Muller then elaborated with three explanations of the mechanism:


He assumed that triploidy was usually the intermediate step in chromosome duplication. This would cause problems, because if most animals' sex was determined by the ratios of chromosomes (as in Drosophila), triploidy would lead to sterility. 
In the rare cases when a tetraploid was accidentally created, it would have to breed with diploids, and this would result in a (presumably sterile) triploid.
If, by chance, two tetraploids were to arise and mate, they would be at a disadvantage because, he said, they would be randomly allocated sex chromosomes and this would lead to a higher proportion of non-viable offspring, and thus the polyploid line would be outcompeted by the diploid.


Unfortunately, whilst the first two points are valid facts about polyploids, the third point is incorrect. A major flaw with Muller's explanation is that it only applies to animals with chromosomal ratio-based sex determination, which we have since discovered is actually relatively few animals. In 1925 there was comparatively little systematic study of life, so we really didn't know what proportion of plant or animal taxa showed polyploidy. Muller's answer doesn't explain why most animals, e.g. those with Y-dominant sex determination, exhibit relatively little polyploidy. Another line of evidence disproving Muller's answer is that, in fact, polyploidy is very common among dioecious plants (those with separate male and female plants; e.g. Westergaard, 1958), while Muller's theory predicts that prevalence in this group should be as low as in animals.

The 'complexity' answer...

Another answer with some historical clout is the one given by Daniel Standage in his answer, and has been given by various scientists over the years (e.g. Stebbins, 1950). This answer states that animals are more complex than plants, so complex that their molecular machinery is much more finely balanced and is disturbed by having multiple genome copies.

This answer has been soundly rejected (e.g. by Orr, 1990) on the basis of two key facts. Firstly, whilst polyploidy is unusual in animals, it does occur. Various animals with hermaphroditic or parthenogenetic modes of reproduction frequently show polyploidy. There are also examples of Mammalian polyploidy (e.g. Gallardo et al., 2004). In addition, polyploidy can be artificially induced in a wide range of animal species, with no deleterious effects (in fact it often causes something akin to hybrid vigour; Jackson, 1976).

It's also worth noting here that since the 1960s Susumo Ohno (e.g. Ohno et al. 1968; Ohno 1970; Ohno 1999) has been proposing that vertebrate evolution involved multiple whole-genome duplication events (in addition to smaller duplications). There is now significant evidence to support this idea, reviewed in Furlong &amp; Holland (2004). If true, it further highlights that animals being more complex (itself a large, and in my view false, assumption) does not preclude polyploidy.

The modern synthesis...

And so to the present day. As reviewed in Mable (2004), it is now thought that:


Polyploidy is an important evolutionary mechanism which was and is probably responsible for a great deal of biological diversity.
Polyploidy arises easily in both animals and plants, but reproductive strategies might prevent it from propagating in certain circumstances, rather than any reduction in fitness resulting from the genome duplication.
Polyploidy may be more prevalent in animals than previously expected, and the imbalance in data arises from the fact that cytogenetics (i.e. chromosome counting) of large populations of wild specimens is a very common practise in botany, and very uncommon in zoology.


In addition, there are now several new suspected factors involved in ploidy which are currently being investigated:


Polyploidy is more common in species from high latitudes (temperate climates) and high altitudes (Soltis &amp; Soltis, 1999). Polyploidy frequently occurs by the production of unreduced gametes (through meiotic non-disjunction), and it has been shown that unreduced gametes are produced with higher frequency in response to environmental fluctuations. This predicts that polyploidy should be more likely to occur in the first place in fluctuating environments (which are more common at higher latitudes and altitudes).
Triploid individuals, the most likely initial result of a genome duplication event, in animals and plants often die before reaching sexual maturity, or have low fertility. However, if triploid individuals do reproduce, there is a chance of even-ploid (fertile) individuals resulting. This probability is increased if the species produces large numbers of both male and female gametes, or has some mechanism of bypassing the triploid individual stage. This may largely explain why many species with 'alternative' sexual modes (apomictic, automictic, unisexual, or gynogenetic) show polyploidy, as they can keep replicating tetraploids, thus increasing the chance that eventually a sexual encounter with another tetraploid will create a new polyploid line. In this way, non-sexual species may be a crucial evolutionary intermediate in generating sexual polyploid species. Species with external fertilisation are more likely to establish polyploid lines - a greater proportion of gametes are involved in fertilisation events and therefore two tetraploid gametes are more likely to meet.
Finally, polyploidy is more likely to occur in species with assortative mixing. That is, when a tetraploid gamete is formed, if the genome duplication somehow affects the individual so as to make it more likely that it will be fertilised by another tetraploid, then it is more likely that a polyploid line will be established. Thus it may be partly down to evolutionary chance as to how easily a species' reproductive traits are affected. For example in plants, tetraploids often have larger flowers or other organs, and thus are preferentially attractive to pollinators. In frogs, genome duplication leads to changes in the vocal apparatus which can lead to immediate reproductive isolation of polyploids.

It is quite common in plants, for example many crops like wheat or Brassica forms. It seems to be rarer in animals but still it is present among some amphibian species like Xenopus.

As I know in mammals polyploidy is lethal (I don't mean tissue - limited polyploidy). I understand that triploidy is harmful due to stronger influence of maternal or paternal epigenetic traits that cause abnormal development of placenta, but why there is no tetraploid mammals?
","Great question, and one about which there has historically been a lot of speculation, and there is currently a lot of misinformation. I will first address the two answers given by other users, which are both incorrect but have been historically suggested by scientists. Then I will try to explain the current understanding (which is not simple or complete). My answer is derived directly from the literature, and in particular from Mable (2004), which in turn is part of the 2004 special issue of the Biological Journal of the Linnean Society tackling the subject.

The 'sex' answer...

In 1925 HJ Muller addressed this question in a famous paper, ""Why polyploidy is rarer in animals than in plants"" (Muller, 1925). Muller briefly described the phenomenon that polyploidy was frequently observed in plants, but rarely in animals. The explanation, he said, was simple (and is approximate to that described in Matthew Piziak's answer):


  animals usually have two sexes which are differentiated by means of a process involving the diploid mechanism of segregation and combination whereas plants-at least the higher plants-are usually hermaphroditic.


Muller then elaborated with three explanations of the mechanism:


He assumed that triploidy was usually the intermediate step in chromosome duplication. This would cause problems, because if most animals' sex was determined by the ratios of chromosomes (as in Drosophila), triploidy would lead to sterility. 
In the rare cases when a tetraploid was accidentally created, it would have to breed with diploids, and this would result in a (presumably sterile) triploid.
If, by chance, two tetraploids were to arise and mate, they would be at a disadvantage because, he said, they would be randomly allocated sex chromosomes and this would lead to a higher proportion of non-viable offspring, and thus the polyploid line would be outcompeted by the diploid.


Unfortunately, whilst the first two points are valid facts about polyploids, the third point is incorrect. A major flaw with Muller's explanation is that it only applies to animals with chromosomal ratio-based sex determination, which we have since discovered is actually relatively few animals. In 1925 there was comparatively little systematic study of life, so we really didn't know what proportion of plant or animal taxa showed polyploidy. Muller's answer doesn't explain why most animals, e.g. those with Y-dominant sex determination, exhibit relatively little polyploidy. Another line of evidence disproving Muller's answer is that, in fact, polyploidy is very common among dioecious plants (those with separate male and female plants; e.g. Westergaard, 1958), while Muller's theory predicts that prevalence in this group should be as low as in animals.

The 'complexity' answer...

Another answer with some historical clout is the one given by Daniel Standage in his answer, and has been given by various scientists over the years (e.g. Stebbins, 1950). This answer states that animals are more complex than plants, so complex that their molecular machinery is much more finely balanced and is disturbed by having multiple genome copies.

This answer has been soundly rejected (e.g. by Orr, 1990) on the basis of two key facts. Firstly, whilst polyploidy is unusual in animals, it does occur. Various animals with hermaphroditic or parthenogenetic modes of reproduction frequently show polyploidy. There are also examples of Mammalian polyploidy (e.g. Gallardo et al., 2004). In addition, polyploidy can be artificially induced in a wide range of animal species, with no deleterious effects (in fact it often causes something akin to hybrid vigour; Jackson, 1976).

It's also worth noting here that since the 1960s Susumo Ohno (e.g. Ohno et al. 1968; Ohno 1970; Ohno 1999) has been proposing that vertebrate evolution involved multiple whole-genome duplication events (in addition to smaller duplications). There is now significant evidence to support this idea, reviewed in Furlong &amp; Holland (2004). If true, it further highlights that animals being more complex (itself a large, and in my view false, assumption) does not preclude polyploidy.

The modern synthesis...

And so to the present day. As reviewed in Mable (2004), it is now thought that:


Polyploidy is an important evolutionary mechanism which was and is probably responsible for a great deal of biological diversity.
Polyploidy arises easily in both animals and plants, but reproductive strategies might prevent it from propagating in certain circumstances, rather than any reduction in fitness resulting from the genome duplication.
Polyploidy may be more prevalent in animals than previously expected, and the imbalance in data arises from the fact that cytogenetics (i.e. chromosome counting) of large populations of wild specimens is a very common practise in botany, and very uncommon in zoology.


In addition, there are now several new suspected factors involved in ploidy which are currently being investigated:


Polyploidy is more common in species from high latitudes (temperate climates) and high altitudes (Soltis &amp; Soltis, 1999). Polyploidy frequently occurs by the production of unreduced gametes (through meiotic non-disjunction), and it has been shown that unreduced gametes are produced with higher frequency in response to environmental fluctuations. This predicts that polyploidy should be more likely to occur in the first place in fluctuating environments (which are more common at higher latitudes and altitudes).
Triploid individuals, the most likely initial result of a genome duplication event, in animals and plants often die before reaching sexual maturity, or have low fertility. However, if triploid individuals do reproduce, there is a chance of even-ploid (fertile) individuals resulting. This probability is increased if the species produces large numbers of both male and female gametes, or has some mechanism of bypassing the triploid individual stage. This may largely explain why many species with 'alternative' sexual modes (apomictic, automictic, unisexual, or gynogenetic) show polyploidy, as they can keep replicating tetraploids, thus increasing the chance that eventually a sexual encounter with another tetraploid will create a new polyploid line. In this way, non-sexual species may be a crucial evolutionary intermediate in generating sexual polyploid species. Species with external fertilisation are more likely to establish polyploid lines - a greater proportion of gametes are involved in fertilisation events and therefore two tetraploid gametes are more likely to meet.
Finally, polyploidy is more likely to occur in species with assortative mixing. That is, when a tetraploid gamete is formed, if the genome duplication somehow affects the individual so as to make it more likely that it will be fertilised by another tetraploid, then it is more likely that a polyploid line will be established. Thus it may be partly down to evolutionary chance as to how easily a species' reproductive traits are affected. For example in plants, tetraploids often have larger flowers or other organs, and thus are preferentially attractive to pollinators. In frogs, genome duplication leads to changes in the vocal apparatus which can lead to immediate reproductive isolation of polyploids.

Here's an image I shot a while ago at a bonfire. Straight of camera, without the white balance set it looks massively orange:



And here's an image shot just now under sodium vapour streetlights (I spent a while looking for any image I'd shot under streetlights, which number very few until I realised I just had to step out my front door!)



Looks similar. But if you play with the white balance in the first image, you can pull it back to somewhere near neutral. This is because the fire being an incandescent (hot) lightsource, emits a broad spectrum. It just happens to be centred on yellow rather than white like sunlight (which is another incandescent source, but much hotter!). We can simply shift the colours to obtain something more similar to daylight:



Now you can now make out the difference between foliage, skintones and denim. The streetlight image, on the other hand is lit with a fluorescent lightsource. These lights emit very narrow frequency spikes, the light is not just centred on orange, it's orange alone and no other colour! If you try to shift it so the spectrum is centred on white like we did with the bonfire image, we end up with this:



Which is effectively monochrome, even after massive saturation boost - the colours just aren't there. The apparent colours at the top and bottom are actually a lens defect that's been brought out due to the lack of colour information and exaggerated by the saturation boost (+50 in Adobe Camera Raw).



For completeness here's a Gretag MacBeth colour rendition chart shot under the same streetlight. White balance was set in ACR based on the ""grey"" tile:



As you can see the image might as well be monochrome. No amount of gelling of the light, or white balance adjustment can save the image. The colour information simply is not present! If you only have line spectra, all that you'll get back is how much of that particular frequency your subject reflects. Getting technical, colour is a vector-valued variable, that is it consists of several coordinates in the colour space. You can't record a point in colour space with a single value (just like you can't describe your point on a map with one value) which is what you have when you illuminate your scene with only one wavelength of light.

This is why fluorescent lights are bad, many of them emit very narrow spectra (though broader than your average streetlight). In particular many are missing a chunk of the red part of the spectrum which results in unnatural greenish skintones. 

Not all fluorescent lights are bad, here's the chart illuminated by the fluorescent lights in my house which were specifically chosen for their wide spectrum (as described by the CRI (colour rendering intent) number of 93 (sunlight is 100)):

3223,3223,5142,Euclid's Algorithm (Greatest Common Divisor),"According to Donald Knuth in ""The Art Of Computer Programming"", the following is how to find the greatest common divisor of two positive numbers, m and n, using Euclid's Algorithm.


  
  Divide m by n and let r be the remainder.
  If r is 0, n is the answer; if r is not 0, continue to step 3.
  Set m = n and n = r. Go back to step 1.
  


Below is my implementation of this algorithm.

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int greatestCommonDivisor(int m, int n)
{
    int r;

    /* Check For Proper Input */
    if((m == 0) || (n == 0))
        return 0;
    else if((m &lt; 0) || (n &lt; 0))
        return -1;

    do
    {
        r = m % n;
        if(r == 0)
            break;
        m = n;
        n = r;
    }
    while(true);

    return n;
}

int main(void)
{
    int num1 = 600, num2 = 120;
    int gcd = greatestCommonDivisor(num1, num2); 

    printf(""The GCD of %d and %d is %d\n"", num1, num2, gcd);

    getchar();
    return 0;
}


Though it appears to work just fine, it doesn't seem to be as elegant as I'd like, especially in the do-while loop.  Also, the while(true) seems dangerous, though I'm pretty confident that r will be reduced to 0 eventually and we'll break out of the loop.

Do you have any suggestions on either making the code more elegant or robust?
",Fiddling Bits,https://codereview.stackexchange.com/users/33159,"Unlike Yuushi, I'm not too fond of recursions, at least when they are not really needed. This is one of those cases.

First, the negative input... The greatest common divisor of numbers -8 and -12 is 4, wouldn't you agree? So, instead of

else if((m &lt; 0) || (n &lt; 0))
    return -1;


I'd put

if (m &lt; 0) m = -m;
if (n &lt; 0) n = -n;


to ensure that both of the numbers are nonnegative. Btw, else rarely (if ever) makes sense after return.

Second, I think that breaking the loop

if (r == 0)
    break;


is misguiding, because what you really want to do is stop the function and return the result. In other words,

Third, since your loop is technically infinite, then do { ... } while(true); is equivalent to while (1) { ... }. Personally, I find the latter to be more readable.

Lastly, true does not exist in standard C. If you really want to use it, then include stdbool.h. This belongs to the C99 standard (so, it doesn't work in C89/C90). Personally, I prefer 1 and 0, but this is probably a matter of habit.

  Divide m by n and let r be the remainder.
  If r is 0, n is the answer; if r is not 0, continue to step 3.
  Set m = n and n = r. Go back to step 1.
  


Below is my implementation of this algorithm.

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int greatestCommonDivisor(int m, int n)
{
    int r;

    /* Check For Proper Input */
    if((m == 0) || (n == 0))
        return 0;
    else if((m &lt; 0) || (n &lt; 0))
        return -1;

    do
    {
        r = m % n;
        if(r == 0)
            break;
        m = n;
        n = r;
    }
    while(true);

    return n;
}

int main(void)
{
    int num1 = 600, num2 = 120;
    int gcd = greatestCommonDivisor(num1, num2); 

    printf(""The GCD of %d and %d is %d\n"", num1, num2, gcd);

    getchar();
    return 0;
}


Though it appears to work just fine, it doesn't seem to be as elegant as I'd like, especially in the do-while loop.  Also, the while(true) seems dangerous, though I'm pretty confident that r will be reduced to 0 eventually and we'll break out of the loop.

Do you have any suggestions on either making the code more elegant or robust?
","Unlike Yuushi, I'm not too fond of recursions, at least when they are not really needed. This is one of those cases.

First, the negative input... The greatest common divisor of numbers -8 and -12 is 4, wouldn't you agree? So, instead of

else if((m &lt; 0) || (n &lt; 0))
    return -1;


I'd put

if (m &lt; 0) m = -m;
if (n &lt; 0) n = -n;


to ensure that both of the numbers are nonnegative. Btw, else rarely (if ever) makes sense after return.

Second, I think that breaking the loop

if (r == 0)
    break;


is misguiding, because what you really want to do is stop the function and return the result. In other words,

if (r == 0) return n;


Third, since your loop is technically infinite, then do { ... } while(true); is equivalent to while (1) { ... }. Personally, I find the latter to be more readable.

Lastly, true does not exist in standard C. If you really want to use it, then include stdbool.h. This belongs to the C99 standard (so, it doesn't work in C89/C90). Personally, I prefer 1 and 0, but this is probably a matter of habit.

",tjameson,https://christianity.stackexchange.com/users/130,"There are many separate views to the matter. I'll try to list the most common ones, along with sources (at the end of each section). I'll first just describe the views briefly; the sources are available for those more interested.

Catholic

The Catholic Church teaches that the Law of Moses (the Old Law) is a preparation for the Gospel, and as such no longer binding. The New Law (the Law of Gospel) is a perfection of it, given through faith in Christ.

The Law of the Gospel is presented in the Sermon of the Mount (Matthew 5-7), but also in the moral catechesis of the apostolic teachings, such as Romans 12-15, 1 Corinthians 12-13, Colossians 3-4, Ephesians 4-5, etc.

God's Law has always remained the same, and has always been available as the natural moral law (e.g. through conscience), but only Jesus could express it perfectly.

Source: Catechism of the Catholic Church, Second edition. Paragraphs 577-582 and 1950-1986. http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/ccc_toc2.htm

Reformed

The reformed teaching is that the law was given in three parts:


The moral law, which God gave first to Adam, and later to Moses on Sinai (the Ten Commandments).
Ceremonial laws, given to the people of Israel, prefiguring Christ.
Judicial laws, given to the State of Israel.


The moral law is eternal, binding Adam, the first man, as well as any Christian today.  Ceremonial laws were abolished in the New Testament. Judicial laws only concerned the State of Israel.

As noted, the moral law was delivered to Moses as the Ten Commandments. Thus the Ten Commandments apply to Christians today as such. Of other laws in the OT, the moral component applies.

Source: Westminster Confession, chapter XIX. http://www.reformed.org/documents/wcf_with_proofs/ch_XIX.html

Theonomy

Theonomy literally means ""God's law"". It is the notion that God's law is eternal and universally binding. That is, the entire Bible applies to Christians today.

This doesn't mean that salvation comes by keeping the law, as theonomy is often misrepresented. Salvation is granted ""solely by grace through faith in the person and work of Jesus Christ"".

Psalm 119:97-98 (KJV) is a good verse to show what theonomy is about:


  O how love I thy law! it is my meditation all the day. 
  Thou through thy commandments hast made me wiser than mine enemies: for they are ever with me.

Dispensationalism

Dispensationalism makes a distinction between Israel and the Christian church in God's plan. Its major objective is to be able to interpret the Bible consistently literally.

Dispensationalists recognize seven dispensations in the Bible:


Innocence (Genesis 1:1–3:7)
Conscience (Genesis 3:8–8:22)
Human government (Genesis 9:1–11:32)
Promise (Genesis 12:1–Exodus 19:25)
Law (Exodus 20:1–Acts 2:4)
Grace (Acts 2:4–Revelation 20:3)
The millennial kingdom (Revelation 20:4-6)


The different dispensations are different ways that God has related to people. Salvation has always been through faith.

As today's Christians are living during the dispensation of grace, or during the New Covenant, the old laws or the Old Covenant do not bind them. Because God and His will do not change, the moral law of the New Covenant hasn't notably changed from the Old Covenant.

The sentences above have the same sentence construction, but the meaning of ""for"" in them vary. I don't know which part can decide the meaning of ""for"". 
","The structure in question is not the macro structure of the sentence, but rather, the patterns to the left and right of the word ""for"".  


  
  Accountbility:
  The entrepreneur has responsibility ► any risk involved.   ( ► = ""for"" )
  Judgement of what can be expected for someone:
  He has too much money ► a young man.  
  Who is intended to have something.
  I have free advice ► you.
  Purpose or function/ Also indicates purpose of time, money, or space or time
  I have two hours ► a rest. 
  Purpose or function / Also indicates purpose of time, money, or space or time
  Many new trains have space ► wheelchair users.  
  In support of somebody/something
  We have no real, objective, scientific evidence ► our belief.
  
  
  This is similar to ""operator overloading"" in software programming:
  Note that 5 + 2 = 7 but ""Hello "" + ""world!"" = ""Hello world!"".  The meaning of the plus sign changes depending on what it is ""given to it"" (aka ""context"").




The question remains, ""How does one go about learning these usages?"" There must be some way to systematically analyze the left/right words in order to determine which meaning of ""for"" is being used.

1463,1463,2304,Why does playing the piano give me a pain in the neck?,"I have a keyboard set up with a proper stool so my arms are held straight out, with music at eye level - almost identical to how I set up my PC for good posture.

But while I can use the PC all day with no issues, within 5 minutes of playing the keyboard - I'm just starting - I get stiffness pain at the bottom of my neck, probably one vertebra above the shoulders.

Can anyone advise what is causing this and how to adjust? I think my main posture can't be too bad - I'm not hunching or craning my neck - but wondered if perhaps I am 'clenching' somehow?
",Mr. Boy,https://music.stackexchange.com/users/15313,"I'm a violinist, not a pianist, but it's very common for beginning violin players to have severe pain because they are too tense, especially when they are self taught.  I'm going to suggest a few generic techniques to start minimizing tension.


When you sit down at the piano, think about how you are sitting.
Look for any tension, especially in your neck and shoulders. Close
your eyes, and take a few deep, slow breaths to help you relax.
Play a note. Not a piece, or even a scale, just a single note.
Think about how relaxed you feel playing that note. Think about
tension in your back and shoulders. If you find any, slow down again
and relax. Now try two notes, or maybe even three or four. But still
think about relaxing, not about music. This is what your body should
feel like all the time when you play.
Now you've got a baseline for how you should feel while playing.
So play something simple. Either a short tune you know well, or a
scale, or whatever you find easy. Halfway through, stop and think
about tension. Did you tense up again? If you did, sit back, relax,
and start over, slower. Slowing down makes it easier to play, and
easier to think about not getting tense.
Another exercise is to practice breathing while playing. A lot of
beginners tend to hold their breathe, which just adds stress and
tension. So play a scale. Depending on your speed, you may want to
breathe in going up, and out going down, or breathe in for 4 notes,
out for 4 notes. Just practice breathing in rhythm, and being aware
of your breathe. When you are playing music, start thinking about
when you breathe in general. Breathing exercises aren't just for
singers.


In summary: Consciously relax before playing, and check for tension as you play. If you get tense, back off, relax, and slow down. Make sure you breathe.

If the tension is caused more by your posture, you may need to find a teacher to help you out, since we can't see how you hold yourself over the net. A teacher could also help with the sort of tension issues I'm talking about here, so if lessons are an option, it would probably be worthwhile, even if only for a short time.

Recently, I had something like KQxxxxx, and a side queen (I forget how the other suits were distributed but was told it didn't matter). My partner was disappointed I didn't ""preempt"" (in ""third"" seat). My response was ""with seven points?""

My understanding is that people often bid three of a suit with seven cards and this little. Sometimes even less, particularly when non-vulnerable vs. vulnerable. In its extreme version, the mantra is ""with any seven (suited) cards.""

Isn't this risky? What if we're doubled and only make three or four tricks?
",Tom Au,https://boardgames.stackexchange.com/users/1344,"Your response of ""With 7 points?"" makes me think you have some misconceptions about the hands the you ought to preempt on. (As an aside, I am really curious: What do you preempt on?). 

One normally preempts on highly offensive hands, which when played in any suit other than your long suit will offer very little defense. The position also is relevant, as in third seat you can really be aggressive in your preempts, opposite a passed hand. The vulnerability and scoring also matters: at IMPS going down 3 doubled, non-vul (-500) against a making vul game is (-600) is a great sacrifice.

Don't look at the total hcp, but look at your suit length and how offensive your hand is.

So a hand like Jxxxxxx, Kx , Qx, Kx (9 hcp) is not a hand to prempt (it offers nice defense and is less offensive oriented), but you should preempt on a hand like KQTxxxx, x, xxx, xx (only 5 hcp).

With KQTxxxx as trumps, assuming partner holds 2 small trumps, you rate to take 5-6 tricks on average. If partner also has an outside A, you will take 6-7 tricks, which is a great bargain (going down 2 or 3) against opponents making game/slam, especially when vul.

The usual point of preempting is that you rate to take away opponent's bidding space, as well as pointing the way to partner in making a sacrifice over opponents game/slam bid.

Ultimately, like with any other bidding situation, it is a risk vs reward + partnership discipline scenario and if you don't go for a number sometimes, you are not preempting enough.

402,402,627,"Buck converter with op-amp, inductor issues when load changes","I'm looking at the designs for a simple buck converter which has the P mosfet, inductor, capacitor and reverse based diode. Instead of PWM, I'm trying out to use an op-amp to switch the P mosfet but one thing that I notice is that if the load changes from low resistance to high resistance then the inductor spikes the voltage on the load to double what it is until it can re-stablise. (This is all in simulation)

Is this happening because I'm using the op-amp? How does using PWM affect the inductor in such a way that if the load would change from say 10 ohms to 100 ohms that the inductor won't spike the voltage? Perhaps PWM / fast switching keeps the inductor with such a low charge that when the load changes, the inductor doesn't have nearly enough voltage to do anything?

Cheers.
",2tails,https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/29571,"An OpAmp will not be able to directly control the state of a MOSFET.  The OpAmp will be too limited in output impedance, slew rate, and output voltage swing.  You are going to want a device that can switch quickly while driving the gate capacitance of a FET.  

There are different ways to control the on and off time of the FET.  PWM is the most used, but there is also constant on time and constant off time.  Constant on time and constant off time can be used in a hysteretic regulation approach, using a comparator to sense the output voltage relative to a reference.  Whatever control technique you try, you will need to bound the on or off time of the switch somehow to have any reasonable control of output voltage.

The rows in the csv are all numbers.  Here is my attempt:

import csv

#read csv file
csv_reader = csv.reader(open('test.csv', 'rU'))

length_list = len(list(csv_reader))
value = []

for line in csv_reader:
    value.append(line) #transfer contents of csv to list

    while counter &lt; length_list:
        check_voucher = input_voucher in value[counter]
        if check_voucher == True:
            print ""TRUE""
        else:
            print ""FALSE""
    counter = counter + 1
find_voucher(1000,1)


When I run the script I get this error:

check_voucher = input_voucher in value[counter]
IndexError: list index out of range

","I'd do something like this:

# value we're looking for
desired_value = 1000

# read csv file
csv_reader = csv.reader(open('test.csv', 'rU'))

# loop through csv file
for line_number, line in enumerate(csv_reader):
    # catch errors in converting to float
    try:
        # if desired matches first value on line
        if desired_value == float(line[0]): 
            # print line number and value
            print line_number, line[0]
    except ValueError as e:
        continue


This looks through the CSV once, converts the first value on each line to a float, and then if the converted float matches the desired_value, print the line number and value matched. 

Test.csv:

",Enda Farrell,https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/111532,"What I typically do is mount the USB drive in an isolated virtual machine. But this requires you have a hypervisor installed and a guest operation system configured, etc. This works because I can snapshot the VM state as well as isolate at the network level. But it's too complicated to explain here.

Probably the easiest way to do this is to mount the drive as read-only. You can do this by using diskutil from Terminal.


Open /Applications/Utilities/Terminal.
Insert the drive into a USB port.
Run diskutil list from Terminal and note the disk number for your USB drive. Here's what my output looked like



  $ diskutil list

So my USB drive is disk2.


Eject the disk by running diskutil unmountDisk /dev/diskX (which would be ""disk2"" for me)
Remount disk in read only mode by running diskutil mountDisk readOnly /dev/diskX
Use Finder or Terminal to examine the disk.


Note that if you eject the drive, you'd need to run this sequence again to have it mount as read only. There are other apps that automate mounting disks as read only but the command line is the only real UI for any OS! ;-) #opinion

Edit:
This is a great simple example  that explain how it works. I've tried to implement it in C++: see my code here, but I'm note sure if I do it the right way. Can you please check if I understood it well, or there are some misunderstanding according to my code ?
","What that sentence means is you should generate $x_t^{(i)}$ from the distribution of $p(x_t|x^{(i)}_{t−1})$.

","I can't fully explain why you see your behavior (I suspect it might be related to returning a strange 2D array, but it's just my own crazy theory), but there seems to be a simple solution.

581,581,908,Why are papers without code but with results accepted?,"I just started reading some papers (Computer Science, specifically Computer Vision) and thought ""now let's look at the source code"" and was quite astonished that most of the papers don't have any source code implementing the described methods to look at, while claiming some performance or being better than other papers.

How do these papers get accepted in journals / conferences? Do people have to submit their source code privately to the reviewers at least, so that they can reproduce the experiment if possible.

Do most journals / conferences just ""trust"" that people who submit the paper really implemented the theory and got those exact results?

I always had this idea that any experiment should be reproducible by others else it's not scientific justified. Been wondering about this the last few days.
",Sam Stoelinga,https://academia.stackexchange.com/users/17302,"You seem to think that we should request code, because without code, any crazy result, be it fraud or honest mistake, can be slipped into the journal. But this is not so. Including code is a nice-to-have feature, not a must-have feature. The other answers silently assume this and explain the (good and not-so-good) reasons which lead to the current situation of uncommonly included code. I think I can complement them by explaining why it is not a must-have feature. 

For theoretical results, you don't need any empirical tools like code to reproduce them, as others mentioned (e.g. proving that an algorithm has a better big O behavior than another). Of course, there are also empirical results, which cannot be replicated that way. 

But your reviewers will have an expectation of what your idea will result in. If the current best performance for wugging zums is 3 zums/s, and you add a minor tweak and report 300 zums/s, your reviewers are supposed to notice that your claim is unusual, and do something (possibly demand to resubmit with the code). This is not foolproof, but with multiple reviewers per paper, it is effective, because the magnitude of most empirical results is predictable once the reviewer sees the idea and understands how it works. 

For this class of paper, both honest and dishonest mistakes have a good chance of being caught, with bad results for honest scientists (reputation loss, especially if caught after publication) and worse results for dishonest scientists (end of career if proven!). Moreover, the graver the mistake (as measured in the size of error), the higher the chance of being caught. It is less likely that you will get caught if your algorithm manages 4 zums/s and you report 5 zums/second, than if you report 300 zums/s. So, scientists are disincentivized from submitting incorrect papers, leaving less incorrect ones in the submitted pool, and the reviewers catch lots of the remainder. 

There are cases where it is totally unknown why an observation is the way it is, and in these cases, it is very important to describe the exact test setup perfectly. But I have never seen this kind of paper in computer science, it is associated with natural sciences. So no code there. Even if you got such results in computer science (e.g. you observed that users are capable of reading a 12000 word EULA in less than 30 seconds, which contradicts common reading speed observations, and you have no explanation for it), it is unlikely that including the code you used to obtain the result will be pertinent to replication. 

To put it together, among a large mass of computer science papers, the theoretical ones and the natural-phenomenon-observation ones don't need code inclusion for replication, and the remaining ones will contain only a low percentage of incorrect-but-uncaught papers. Aggregated, this leads to an acceptably low level of incorrect papers being submitted. Requesting the code to go with them will increase quality for one class of paper, but it will be an increase of an already high quality level. It is not that not having this feature makes the current quality too low.

directory/

4273,4273,6810,Protractor test vs long-polling,"I have an Angular web app that continuously listens for notifications from the backend via long-poll:

scope.notification = $resource('/notification').get();


This request never completes in the test environment. This is a problem for Protractor, because it wants to wait for all outstanding HTTP requests to finish.

I see a number of potential solutions, but have some issues with all of them.

I do not see a way to tell Protractor to ignore this request. Issuing it from $interval (which itself is ignored) is not a solution. Protractor will not wait for the request to be sent, but once it's sent, it will still wait for it to complete.

So I'm trying not to send this request when running the tests. But how do I know I'm in a test?


I could add a flag to the URL (?protractor=true). But my web app modifies the URL all the time, so it would get cleared quickly.
I tried setting a variable: browser.executeScript('window.runningProtractorTests = true;'); But it seems Protractor will wait for the page to sync first before running executeScript. And I'm sending the request right away when the page loads.
I could set a cookie. But it's fairly cumbersome, e.g. I'd have to load the page twice. (See issue 341 for more difficulties.)
I could set a user agent. It's not easy either. I would need to set browser flags for each browser in the config file. I do not want to completely override the user agent (to Protractor, for example) out of fear that my libraries may rely on interpreting the user agent string, so I'd have to figure out the right string.
I could check if the server is running on a specific port. But then a year from now someone will try to run the production server on the same port and not understand why the notifications don't work.
Making the test backend complete the request immediately does not help, because it's immediately sent again whenever it completes. But I guess I could introduce a special ""you are in a test"" notification and stop the polling when this is received. This would mean a (small) change to our protocol, so I'd rather avoid it if possible.

4050,4050,6464,What's the best way to scan in hundreds of pictures?,"I have thousands of old pictures which were sitting in a photo album. Unfortunately, instead of the photo album protecting the pictures, the plastic coverings yellowed, and the pictures themselves had to be carefully extracted from the books. There is also quite a bit of powdered paper (the backings on the books pretty much fell apart while we extracted the pictures), and the fronts of the images are still a bit sticky.

These pictures are 30+ years old, are often extremely faded, and were originally taken on (what I think is) ""110 film"" -- they are approximately 2.5"" squares.

Anyway, I need to scan all these images in to preserve them from further decay. Unfortunately, it's taking forever -- going through less than 100 images took an entire day, even if one discounts any time spent in Photoshop trying to remove some of the photo album's artifacts on the images.

What I really need is some method of scanning the images in faster. Most automated solutions aren't going to work because they accept 4x6s as their smallest image size, and even if that was not the case, the adhesives still stuck to the prints would probably ruin any such device in 5 seconds flat.

Is there a better way of doing this (i.e. fast scanner?) that wouldn't take so much time?

Unfortunately, instead of the photo album protecting the pictures, the plastic coverings yellowed, and the pictures themselves had to be carefully extracted from the books. There is also quite a bit of powdered paper (the backings on the books pretty much fell apart while we extracted the pictures), and the fronts of the images are still a bit sticky.

These pictures are 30+ years old, are often extremely faded, and were originally taken on (what I think is) ""110 film"" -- they are approximately 2.5"" squares.

Anyway, I need to scan all these images in to preserve them from further decay. Unfortunately, it's taking forever -- going through less than 100 images took an entire day, even if one discounts any time spent in Photoshop trying to remove some of the photo album's artifacts on the images.

What I really need is some method of scanning the images in faster. Most automated solutions aren't going to work because they accept 4x6s as their smallest image size, and even if that was not the case, the adhesives still stuck to the prints would probably ruin any such device in 5 seconds flat.

Is there a better way of doing this (i.e. fast scanner?) that wouldn't take so much time?

5903,5903,9349,Equivalent of Java 1.6 @Override for interfaces in C#,"This question gives the answer that Java's @Override has the C# equivalent of the override keyword on methods. However, since Java 1.6 the @Override annotation can be applied to interfaces also.

The practical use for this is that in Java you get compile errors when a class claims it implements an interface method when it no longer does (e.g. if the interface method is removed). Is there equivalent functionality in C#?

Some code examples:

Java:

public interface A {
  public void foo();
  // public void bar(); // Removed method.
}

public class B implements A {
  @Override public void foo();
  @Override public void bar(); // Compile error
}


C#:

public interface IA {
  void Foo();
  // void Bar(); // Removed method.
}

public class B : A {
  public override void Foo(); // Doesn't compile as not 'overriding' method
  public void Bar(); // Compiles, but no longer implements interface method
}

",Bringer128,https://stackoverflow.com/users/545680,"As stated, you cannot get that kind of control from an interface alone in C#. You could get it from an abstract class however. For the purpose of completeness, here is what you could do:

}

public abstract class A : IA
{

The practical use for this is that in Java you get compile errors when a class claims it implements an interface method when it no longer does (e.g. if the interface method is removed). Is there equivalent functionality in C#?

Some code examples:

Java:

public interface A {
  public void foo();
  // public void bar(); // Removed method.
}

public class B implements A {
  @Override public void foo();
  @Override public void bar(); // Compile error
}


C#:

public interface IA {
  void Foo();
  // void Bar(); // Removed method.
}

public class B : A {
  public override void Foo(); // Doesn't compile as not 'overriding' method
  public void Bar(); // Compiles, but no longer implements interface method
}

","As stated, you cannot get that kind of control from an interface alone in C#. You could get it from an abstract class however. For the purpose of completeness, here is what you could do:

public interface IA
{
    void Foo();
    //void Bar(); - removed
}

public abstract class A : IA
{
    virtual void Foo()
    { }

    // Removed method
    //virtual void Bar()
    //{ }
}

public class B : A
{
    public override void Foo()
    { }

    //throws an error like the one you were receiving regarding no method to override.
    public override void Bar()
    { }
}

3077,3077,4898,Java 8 -- How do I calculate (milli)seconds from now using xsd:duration,"I feel like this question has been asked in one way or another, but I'm still not confident of my result.

I have an xsd:duration which will give me a desired expiration described in years, months, days, and seconds. I can collect the integer values of these parts with, for example, duration.getYears() or duration.getMonths().

Because my chosen db is Cassandra, I want to exploit the TTL option, which will automatically expire an inserted row after a specified number of seconds.

The critical part is getting from xsd:duration to an integer/long value of seconds which respects the Gregorian calendar (where 1 month from now is not simply 30.41 days, but 31).

At the moment, I'm using the following code:

LocalDateTime then = LocalDateTime.now().plusYears(duration.getYears()).plusMonths(duration.getMonths()).plusDays(duration.getDays()).plusHours(duration.getHours()).plusMinutes(duration.getMinutes()).plusSeconds(duration.getSeconds());
long ttlMillis = then.toInstant(ZoneOffset.UTC).toEpochMilli() - Instant.now().toEpochMilli();


Is there a quicker/cleaner way to do this?

I'm also not sure if I should worry about large durations... My particular use cases wouldn't call for anything larger that 2 years.
",blackstrype,https://stackoverflow.com/users/404750,"Informational note for all: 

You are talking about javax.xml.datatype.Duration, not java.time.Duration.

Your questions:

a) Is there a quicker way to do this (using Java-8)? Hardly. The designers of JSR-310-team responsible for the new date- and time library in Java-8 have not cared much about the bridge to the existing XML-classes in JDK. So there is no direct way to convert from xml-duration to any kind of JSR-310-duration.

Keep also in mind that the JSR-310-classes Period (with state consisting of years, months and days) and Duration (with state consisting of seconds and nanoseconds) are not really designed for representing an xml-duration (which has more units as seen in your code). So I doubt if we might see a well-defined bridge between JSR-310 and XML in the future (maybe only on millisecond base?). The sign handling is also completely different in JSR-310 and XML. So be cautious if you have negative sign in xml-duration.

b) Is there a cleaner way to do this (using Java-8)? Yes, a little bit. One thing to consider is: I would use the clock as time source for the actual instant only once and not twice as you have done it. Example for this (very) minor improvement:

Instant now = Instant.now();
LocalDateTime start = now.atOffset(ZoneOffset.UTC).toLocalDateTime();
LocalDateTime end = 
  start.plusYears(duration.getYears())
  .plusMonths(duration.getMonths())
  .plusDays(duration.getDays())
  .plusHours(duration.getHours())
  .plusMinutes(duration.getMinutes())
  .plusSeconds(duration.getSeconds());
long deltaInMillis = end.toInstant(ZoneOffset.UTC).toEpochMilli() - now.toEpochMilli();


Second thing to consider: The xml-duration class is designed for interoperation with java.util.Date. So you also have this short alternative:

Date start = new Date();
long deltaInMillis = duration.getTimeInMillis(start);


This alternative is not only much shorter, but is probably also more precise because it takes into account the millisecond part. According to the documentation you should only worry about the correctness if you have duration items in long range (excessing the range of int). Another topic is the relationship to any hidden timezone calculation. I have not seen any hint in the documentation, so this is maybe the only item which can make you worry (either local timezone? or UTC? - not tested).

c) Why worry about large durations? Even if your duration is larger than let's say some centuries possibly crossing the validity limits of historic gregorian calendar, you should keep in mind that xml-duration only uses the proleptic gregorian calendar, not the historical one. And LocalDateTime uses the same proleptic gregorian calendar, too. If such a large duration is related to any real data is another good question however.

",Developer Android,https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/11520,"Clocks don't generally have an active ""level"" per say; in many cases clock outputs will specify that they'll only stop when they're at a certain level, but otherwise clocks have active edges.  Typically, SPI devices will use one clock edge as a signal to output each bit of data, and the following clock edge as a signal that to latch the data from the other device.  In some cases, SPI devices will asynchronously place the first bit of data; the first clock transition will latch that and the second will output the second bit, the third will latch the second bit and the fourth will place the next, etc.  The fifteenth transition will latch the last bit, and the sixteenth will indicate that the device should start outputting the first bit of the next byte sometime before the next clock transition.

936,936,1486,How to show $a$ is an element of every maximal ideal of ring $R$ iff $1-ab$ is a unit for all $b \in R$?,"Let $R$ be a commutative unitary ring. The task is to prove the statement which says that for an element $a\in R$ stands: $a$ is an element of every maximal ideal of $R$ iff $1-ab$ is a unit for all $b \in R$.

My effort

Further I suppose ring is non-trivial, otherwise situation is clear.

For an arbitrary $b \in R$ we consider principal ideal $(b)$ and find a maximal ideal $\mathfrak{m}_b\supset (b)$ (according to Zorn's Lemma), so we have $a\in \mathfrak{m}_b, b \in \mathfrak{m}_b\Rightarrow ab \in \mathfrak{m}_b$. $\mathfrak{m}_b$ is maximal, hence particularly prime, so $1\notin \mathfrak{m}_b$ and $(1-ab)+\mathfrak{m}_b\neq0+\mathfrak{m}_b\in R/\mathfrak{m}_b$. $R/\mathfrak{m}_b$ is a field, so we find $p \in R : p(1-ab)+\mathfrak{m}_b=1+\mathfrak{m}_b$. But seemingly this is not enough to find inverse of $1-ab$ in $R$.

In other direction I can only show that: $1-ab$  is invertible $\Rightarrow ab\neq1\Rightarrow a$ is not a unit and hence is an element of a maximal ideal. But I can't figure out how to show that $a$ is in every maximal ideal.

I give up because I tried to solve this too long, the statement seems pretty natural for me, but I don't see something obvious so I would love it if someone gives me an advice.

Basically, you can show one of your passports to benefit from the most advantageous rules.

What could happen in some cases is that border guards notice you are a Canadian resident (because you come from Canada without a visa - if you are a citizen - or have a long-stay visa or stamps in your passport - if you are not) and question you about that (it's more likely to happen with a country they consider sensitive for some reason, which Canada usually is not).

If a person has cancer could this somehow alter the person's immune system so it doesn't function effectively to detect greatly mutated cells? Does the fact that a tumor is 'made' of 'mutated' non-foreign human cells help it to be undetectable?
",201044,https://biology.stackexchange.com/users/11605,"Great question and in part, you are correct. However, you must also remember that this greatly depends on what genes have undergone mutation. 

In the case of cancer, it's usually either a gene that regulates cell proliferation rates, induces programmed cell death or helps to repair damaged DNA. When one (or all) of these genes is mutated, the cell constantly proliferates and/or does not die when it is ""programmed"" to do so or cannot repair mutations to it's DNA, thus creating a cancerous tumor.

Now, on to the immune system. The reason a persons immune system does not target and kill it's own cells is because of a certain set of genes that is specific to each and every person called Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC). These genes encode specific cell surface molecules that the immune system cannot produce antibodies to bind to because they are ""locked"", if you will (see, the immune has a sort of built-in list of genes that code for antibodies that bind to different sequences of molecules (that's how you develop immunity and fight pathogens), the genes that code for the specific molecules that your cells have on their surface are just not on that list.) In order for a person's immune system to recognize cancerous cells as a pathogen and destroy them, the cancer cell's MHC genes would also need to be mutated drastically.

For instance, breast cancer is usually caused by a mutation in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes. These genes assist in DNA repair. Even if this mutation happens, these cells still have the same MHC as the rest of the cells in your body because BRCA1 and BRCA2 don't really have much to do with MHC. Because of this, the immune system does not recognize the cancerous cells as a threat and is unable to destroy or even detect them.

I hope this answers your question.

5396,5396,8573,"New to circuits, confused about where reset happens with SR flip-flop","In one of my classes we are learning about circuits. For homework, we have to create a finite state machine for a vending machine using an SR flip-flop. The machine can either take a nickel, dime, or nothing until it gets to at least 15 cents, so it has 4 states (0, 5, 10, and 15 cents). Once the machine receives 15 cents, it dispenses its product. Once in this state, if nothing is deposited it goes to the 0 state; if a nickel is deposited it goes to the 5 cent state; if a dime is deposited, it does to the 10 cent state. 

The truth table that I came up with is:

Based on this truth table [and the k-maps I made from it], I created the following logic gates:


My question is, where exactly does the ""reset"" happen? For example, if I am in the 15 cent state and deposit a nickel, how does it go to the 5 cent stage? Do I have to make the output from ""open"" loop around? Sorry for such a novice question, I hope that made sense!

Edit: The first two columns are for the present state of the machine, i.e., how much you have deposited so far. So Q0 Q1 = 00 represents the first state (0 cents), Q0 Q1 = 01 represents the second state (5 cents), etc. The next two columns represent adding a nickel or dime. If you are in the state 00 and and 01, you should move to state 01. Since you cannot deposit a nickel and dime simultaneously, we don't care about the the input 11. If you are in state 10 and add 10, you go to state 11 (and don't get any change back!).
",A D,https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/8855,"Depending upon how the coin sensors and output of the machine are implemented, you might need some more states to allow for the fact that a coin might be hitting a switch for an arbitrary length of time; I don't see anything in your machine to handle that.  It's also not clear how long the ""dispense product"" output is supposed to be active.  A logical possibility would be that ""dispense product"" should remain active until a signal is returned from the mechanism indicating that the product has been dispensed, whereupon the machine should reset to its start state.

Also, if you are going to use RS latches, you need to design your machine so that if multiple latches switch simultaneously for a state transition, it won't matter whether one switches before the other.  If the machine was sitting in state ""01"" and a nickel arrived, it would attempt to transition into state ""10"".  If Q0 and Q1 are RS latches, there is no reason to expect them to switch simultaneously.

If you want to minimize the number of states, the theoretical minimum set, assuming the dispensing mechanism's cycle will last at least as long as a coin input would be:


Nothing inserted
Switches active with $0.05
Switches idle with $0.05
Switches active with $0.10
Switches idle with $0.10
Total of $0.15 inserted (switch state irrelevant)


Six states, probably allowing a three-bit state machine.  I would conjecture, though, that you might find it easier to use different states for the ""switch active with second nickel"" and ""switch active with first dime"" scenarios.  Also, you might be able to reduce circuitry further if you use four latches in two pairs, where the states of the first pair of latches are computed using the outputs of the second, and the second pair of latches copies the state of the first whenever no coins are present.

Switches active with $0.05
Switches idle with $0.05
Switches active with $0.10
Switches idle with $0.10
Total of $0.15 inserted (switch state irrelevant)


Six states, probably allowing a three-bit state machine.  I would conjecture, though, that you might find it easier to use different states for the ""switch active with second nickel"" and ""switch active with first dime"" scenarios.  Also, you might be able to reduce circuitry further if you use four latches in two pairs, where the states of the first pair of latches are computed using the outputs of the second, and the second pair of latches copies the state of the first whenever no coins are present.

1715,1715,2716,Thunderbolt Display Camera No Longer Recognized by my Macbook Pro,"I have a MacBook Pro Retina 2.5 GHz Core i7 with OS X 10.9.5 from March 2014.

I teach in an Adobe classroom every week, and have never had the following problem until last night after I downloaded the new Adobe Plug-in.

The video pod in the room has always recognized the camera on one of my two Thunderbolt displays as the video source (and optional audio feed) for my classroom. As of last night however, after the update downloaded in Firefox the Thunderbolt camera and audio are no longer recognized, only FaceTime HD is listed. I can get a video feed only when I open up the laptop.

The audio option from my displays is also gone from the list in Adobe. In Google Chrome, the Adobe room video dropdown option box essentially says, ""No camera available"" - so in Chrome it does not even recognize the MacBook Pro's camera as available. I usually use Firefox, and have never had problems until last night's update.

Bottom line, my MacBook Pro no longer seems to recognize that the Thunderbolt displays have a camera and audio feed available. Can someone help me to fix this please?

1445,1445,2276,Protractor test vs long-polling,"I have an Angular web app that continuously listens for notifications from the backend via long-poll:

scope.notification = $resource('/notification').get();


This request never completes in the test environment. This is a problem for Protractor, because it wants to wait for all outstanding HTTP requests to finish.

I see a number of potential solutions, but have some issues with all of them.

I do not see a way to tell Protractor to ignore this request. Issuing it from $interval (which itself is ignored) is not a solution. Protractor will not wait for the request to be sent, but once it's sent, it will still wait for it to complete.

So I'm trying not to send this request when running the tests. But how do I know I'm in a test?


I could add a flag to the URL (?protractor=true). But my web app modifies the URL all the time, so it would get cleared quickly.
I tried setting a variable: browser.executeScript('window.runningProtractorTests = true;'); But it seems Protractor will wait for the page to sync first before running executeScript. And I'm sending the request right away when the page loads.
I could set a cookie. But it's fairly cumbersome, e.g. I'd have to load the page twice. (See issue 341 for more difficulties.)
I could set a user agent. It's not easy either. I would need to set browser flags for each browser in the config file. I do not want to completely override the user agent (to Protractor, for example) out of fear that my libraries may rely on interpreting the user agent string, so I'd have to figure out the right string.
I could check if the server is running on a specific port. But then a year from now someone will try to run the production server on the same port and not understand why the notifications don't work.
Making the test backend complete the request immediately does not help, because it's immediately sent again whenever it completes. But I guess I could introduce a special ""you are in a test"" notification and stop the polling when this is received. This would mean a (small) change to our protocol, so I'd rather avoid it if possible.

1476,1476,2322,Migrate to new server 2008 file server but keep old server name (under domain AD),"i am moving to a new file server under Server 2008 Standard 32bit edition. I will refer to the older server as just ""server"", the new one i named as server2.

i have updated server2 and patched it. I have also joined the domain as member server and set up the raid structure. I have also moved the data over to the right spot. BUT here is what i am not 100% sure on.

The company wants to keep the old name of ""server"", i did not want to do that and was thinking of just making a cname alias in AD DNS forward lookup zone to point to the new ip address of server2 but you can reference it as server. In order to do the alias i would naturally remove or rename the old server or just unjoin it from the domain altogether.

I have read that you can just rename a computer to a previous name in AD as long as you have unjoined and removed it from the appropirate list under Active Directory? Can i just rename a server that is a member server in a domain? Do i have to change the sid or run newsid?

Just looking for some best practices.
thanks in advance.

",dasko,https://serverfault.com/users/90428,"I am assuming that SERVER and SERVER2 are both member server computers and not domain controller computers.

When I replace old server computers I try and assign the name of the old server computer I'm replacing to the new machine. This is a common practice. (If you're consolidating servers then that's a a whole different ""can of worms"".)

There's no problem with renaming a domain member server computer after it's joined to the domain. (Supposedly you can rename domain controllers in the Server 2008 version of Active Directory, but I haven't tried it yet.) Of course, in the case of re-using a name that was already assigned to another computer, you'll want to either take the original computer holding that name offline or rename it.

I've done what you're describing many, many times with various versions of Windows. From the point you've described, I'd rename ""SERVER"" to ""OLDSERVER"", and ""SERVER2"" to ""SERVER"", leaving both joined to the domain throughout the process. You don't have to disjoin ""SERVER"" from the domain in this process. Once you've renamed ""SERVER"" while joined to the domain to ""OLDSERVER"", the object in the AD previously named ""SERVER"" will change to ""OLDSERVER"", freeing the name ""SERVER"" to be assigned to ""SERVER2"".

I will refer to the older server as just ""server"", the new one i named as server2.

i have updated server2 and patched it. I have also joined the domain as member server and set up the raid structure. I have also moved the data over to the right spot. BUT here is what i am not 100% sure on.

The company wants to keep the old name of ""server"", i did not want to do that and was thinking of just making a cname alias in AD DNS forward lookup zone to point to the new ip address of server2 but you can reference it as server. In order to do the alias i would naturally remove or rename the old server or just unjoin it from the domain altogether.

I have read that you can just rename a computer to a previous name in AD as long as you have unjoined and removed it from the appropirate list under Active Directory? Can i just rename a server that is a member server in a domain? Do i have to change the sid or run newsid?

Just looking for some best practices.
thanks in advance.

","I am assuming that SERVER and SERVER2 are both member server computers and not domain controller computers.

When I replace old server computers I try and assign the name of the old server computer I'm replacing to the new machine. This is a common practice. (If you're consolidating servers then that's a a whole different ""can of worms"".)

There's no problem with renaming a domain member server computer after it's joined to the domain. (Supposedly you can rename domain controllers in the Server 2008 version of Active Directory, but I haven't tried it yet.) Of course, in the case of re-using a name that was already assigned to another computer, you'll want to either take the original computer holding that name offline or rename it.

I've done what you're describing many, many times with various versions of Windows. From the point you've described, I'd rename ""SERVER"" to ""OLDSERVER"", and ""SERVER2"" to ""SERVER"", leaving both joined to the domain throughout the process. You don't have to disjoin ""SERVER"" from the domain in this process. Once you've renamed ""SERVER"" while joined to the domain to ""OLDSERVER"", the object in the AD previously named ""SERVER"" will change to ""OLDSERVER"", freeing the name ""SERVER"" to be assigned to ""SERVER2"".

As an aside: I have no idea why you'd be running ""newsid"" unless you installed the system from a disk image (and even then, you should be using SYSPREP to change the SID).

4484,4484,7110,What's the best way to scan in hundreds of pictures?,"I have thousands of old pictures which were sitting in a photo album. Unfortunately, instead of the photo album protecting the pictures, the plastic coverings yellowed, and the pictures themselves had to be carefully extracted from the books. There is also quite a bit of powdered paper (the backings on the books pretty much fell apart while we extracted the pictures), and the fronts of the images are still a bit sticky.

These pictures are 30+ years old, are often extremely faded, and were originally taken on (what I think is) ""110 film"" -- they are approximately 2.5"" squares.

Anyway, I need to scan all these images in to preserve them from further decay. Unfortunately, it's taking forever -- going through less than 100 images took an entire day, even if one discounts any time spent in Photoshop trying to remove some of the photo album's artifacts on the images.

What I really need is some method of scanning the images in faster. Most automated solutions aren't going to work because they accept 4x6s as their smallest image size, and even if that was not the case, the adhesives still stuck to the prints would probably ruin any such device in 5 seconds flat.

function getHandColor()

1547,1547,2428,Why does my bike make a noise when I pedal hard?,"When I pedal forcing a little with my right leg, the bike makes a noise that I don't know how to describe. I'll try to do it. It's like:


a short ""ting""
a tiny bell
if a small rock hits the down tube


I don't know what is causing this noise, but I think that it could be any of this things:


pedal
crank arm/pedal connection
crankset


I think the material of all these things is alluminium.

I don't feel anything (like a bad shifted chain) when I hear the noise.

It happens when there is movement and when there is NO movement (I use the brake, so the bike doesn'e move, stand using all weight on right pedal, and it makes the noise)

The pedals could be in any position, It is not in a particular position. Just pressing the right pedal.

Has someone else has this ""problem""? Any ideas of where this comes from?

Update:
Yesterday I took out the chain and stood on the right pedal, and made the noise. Then is not the chain, nor the transmission system.

I put oil in the pedal axis, but had no luck. Also tried to loose the pedal, but the juncture point is too tight, and I couldn't.

Today I will try to use oil in the bottom bracket.

  Matthew 5:17-18 (KJV)
  17 Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil. 18 For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.


As I understand it, the Law of Moses is fulfilled in Christ. We don't make sacrifices anymore, and many other of the finer points in the Pentateuch are no longer preached.

Yet, I still see people reference these books for doctrine (for example the 10 Commandments).

How much of the Law of Moses still applies?
",tjameson,https://christianity.stackexchange.com/users/130,"How much of the Law of Moses still applies? First we must understand why we have the Law. Originally, the only rule was to not eat from the fruit of the knowledge of Good and Evil (Genesis 2:17). Then what followed because that happened. Cain killed Able (Genesis 4:8). Then eventually the flood. The answer is found in the reason for the flood. ""The LORD saw how great the wickedness of the human race had become on the earth, and that every inclination of the thoughts of the human heart was only evil all the time. (Genesis 6:5)""

So God's desire can be explained in the inverse: ""God would see it great if the human race was kind on the earth, and that every inclination of the thoughts of the human heart was only good all the time.""

This idea is also proven by Jesus himself: Jesus said to him, “‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind.’ This is the first and greatest commandment. The second is like it: ‘Love your neighbor as yourself.’ All the law and the prophets depend on these two commandments.” -Matthew 22:37-40

The description of kindness and good thoughts of a human heart: If you where set to the task of ruling people toward God's desire. What might you put on your list? (Ok, nobody kill each other, don't steal, etc.)

Why the List didn't work? Pride, Ego, Natural Rebellion (Simply because the list exist).

How Faith leads to kindness and good thoughts and replaced the list. If you want people to have good thoughts about each other. More analysis needs to be focused on what makes people have bad thoughts. If you could stop the bad thoughts, then you have a world of only good thoughts. Lets take a look at psychology and pinpoint what causes anger. What we find is that anger is caused by the decision to fix the threatening behavior. So if we never took negative matters into our own hands, and relied only on God to justly handle the situation. We can prevent ourselves from getting angry.

Does this ideology match with the teachings? Do not take revenge, my dear friends, but leave room for God's wrath, for it is written: ""It is mine to avenge; I will repay,"" says the Lord (Romans 12:19). But I tell you, do not resist an evil person. If anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to them the other cheek also (Matthew 5:39). But now ye also put off all these; anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy communication out of your mouth (Colossians 3:8). When they kept on questioning him, he straightened up and said to them, ""Let any one of you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her."" (John 8:7)

What evidence do we have that God will take care of it for me? When they began to shout and praise, the Lord suddenly attacked the Ammonites, Moabites, and men from Mount Seir who were invading Judah, and they were defeated (2 Chronicles 20:22).

Oh so the Law is still active? Yes (Luke 16:17).

Oh so God fulfills the law! Yup, if someone cuts out my eye, if God feels that it is necessary, he will cut that eye out for me. This is done so that my thoughts are ""good"" and that ""evil can avoid my heart"".

Now what if everyone followed the Law But everyone didn't. ""When Jesus went outside, the Pharisees and the teachers of the law began to oppose him fiercely and to besiege him with questions,"" (Luke 11:53). The outcome of the law and the thoughts in their heart.

So the Law is inferior to faith? Yes, because it didn't accomplish God's Desire.

This is a great simple example  that explain how it works. I've tried to implement it in C++: see my code here, but I'm note sure if I do it the right way. Can you please check if I understood it well, or there are some misunderstanding according to my code ?

Maybe you can explain what you are doing and that way I can comment.

You could also create brushes with end caps (pattern brush) but arrowheads offer the advantage of scaling with the stroke properly and brushes can be hit or miss when it comes to scaling ends without middle pieces.

These queries ran great with my test data (~1500 events).  Now that I'm starting to use a copy of the real data (~400,000 events, ~500,000 event_dates), my application is timing out before I get results back from the database.  I have added indexes on all relevant columns, which only helped a little bit.  I've narrowed down the problem to the subqueries that use aggregation.

Now the real version of these subqueries does things like time zone manipulation or a count instead of array_agg, so using a trigger to update a counter column is not practical in many instances.  The dates associated with events must be individual rows rather than stored as an array since they have a foreign key relationship with other tables.

What would be my best bet for improving performance here?  I understand that the subquery is being evaluated first, but I don't know which dates I actually need to look at until I've done the joins.  I have looked at lateral joins, but I am uncertain if they would help here (and most information I can find is along the lines of ""look, new feature!"").

2384,2384,3804,Why does my bike make a noise when I pedal hard?,"When I pedal forcing a little with my right leg, the bike makes a noise that I don't know how to describe. I'll try to do it. It's like:


a short ""ting""
a tiny bell
if a small rock hits the down tube


I don't know what is causing this noise, but I think that it could be any of this things:


pedal
crank arm/pedal connection
crankset


I think the material of all these things is alluminium.

I don't feel anything (like a bad shifted chain) when I hear the noise.

It happens when there is movement and when there is NO movement (I use the brake, so the bike doesn'e move, stand using all weight on right pedal, and it makes the noise)

The pedals could be in any position, It is not in a particular position. Just pressing the right pedal.

Has someone else has this ""problem""? Any ideas of where this comes from?

Update:
Yesterday I took out the chain and stood on the right pedal, and made the noise. Then is not the chain, nor the transmission system.

I put oil in the pedal axis, but had no luck. Also tried to loose the pedal, but the juncture point is too tight, and I couldn't.

Today I will try to use oil in the bottom bracket.

Update: here is a link to info on the bike http://www.diamondback.com/2012-sorrento maybe it helps to know the model of all the components.

",user4084,https://ell.stackexchange.com/users/4084,"Why news headlines are written as ""He says ..."" or ""He kills ..."" instead of ""He said ..."" or ""He killed ...""?

That is because news headlines are written in a compressed telegraphic style, also known as Headlinese.

It might be the best for learners to read this writing style differently from ordinary English. This style has its own special rules of grammar. Short forms, contractions, and abbreviations are usually used. The main reason is to save space.

Here are some useful grammar rules for headlines (the examples are all real news headlines):


Headlines often omit articles and the verb to be. 


  Venezuelan opposition leader in custody -- the leader is in custody
  Old London Air Raid Shelter Becomes Vegetable Farm -- no articles
  Husband Finding Peace After A Terrorist Attack -- the husband is finding peace

Most verbs are in the present tenses (as opposed to progressive or perfect forms). The simple present tense is used for both present and past events.


  Heavy snow triggers collapse
  Obama Wants Tougher Fuel Standards For Big Trucks
  Detroit Maps Entire City To Find Bad Buildings

The future is usually expressed as ""to"" followed by a verb.


  Damon Albarn And St. Vincent To Play NPR Music's SXSW Showcase

Auxiliary verbs are usually dropped from passive structures.


  'Trapped' South Africa miners rescued -- the miners were rescued
  Yemen: 12 killed, 14 soldiers captured in clashes with militants -- 12 people were killed and 14 soldiers were captured





To recap, the simple present tense is preferred. And one good reason to avoid the past tense is because the verb to be is often omitted, which makes the passive voice look like the past tense.

So your tentative headlines could be explained or rephrased like these:


  Parliament passes bill -- we prefer the present tense

2916,2916,4640,What kind of energy does superfluidity use?,"Liquid helium (and other similar fluids) can ""climb up"" the walls of their containers. Who does the work in this case, and what kind of energy does it use? I'm sure we can't make a perpetuum mobile out of this, so I guess some kind of energy must somehow be expended to make the fluid ""climb up"" the wall.
",vsz,https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/14088,"Courtesy of the book Carl found we have an answer!



Consider the element of the liquid helium at a height $h$ above the fluid surface and distance $y$ from the wall. To raise that element above the fluid surface costs an energy $mgh$, but because there is a Van der Waals attraction between the helium atoms and the wall you get back an energy $E_{VdW}$. Dzyaloshinskii et al give the energy change per unit mass as:

$$ \Delta E = gh - \frac{\alpha}{y^n} $$

where $\alpha$ is constant giving the strength of the Van der Waals attraction and $n$ is in the range 3 - 4 depending on the film thickness. So it is energetically favourable to lift the fluid up the wall if the Van der Waals attraction outweighs the gravitational potential energy making $\Delta E$ negative. Since $y$ can be taken arbitrarily small (well, at least down to a few times the He atom size) $\Delta E$ will be negative for all heights $h$ and the film covers the whole wall.

The resulting equation for the film thickness $d$ as a function of height is given (without derivation) as:

$$ d \approx \left( \frac{\alpha}{gh} \right)^{1/n} $$

Since the liquid film will have a non-zero thickness at the top of the container wall it can flow over the wall and then down the outside. Even though the film thicknesses work out to be only a few tens of nanometres the zero viscosity of the superfluid helium allows an appreciable flow rate. Indeed, later in the book flow velocities of 30 cm/s are mentioned.

In principle this would apply to all fluids, however for normal fluids the flow rate in a film a few tens of nanometres thick would be infinitesimally small so the climbing is never observed.

A few comments of my own: I note that this derivation ignores the interfacial tensions of the helium/air, helium/wall and air/wall interfaces. I have no figures for what these would be for superfluid helium and possibly they are negligable. The predictions of the Dzyaloshinskii theory are claimed to agree well with experiment. Also you should note that one of the references provided by Carl challenges the above explanation, though without coming to any firm conclusions.

So it is energetically favourable to lift the fluid up the wall if the Van der Waals attraction outweighs the gravitational potential energy making $\Delta E$ negative. Since $y$ can be taken arbitrarily small (well, at least down to a few times the He atom size) $\Delta E$ will be negative for all heights $h$ and the film covers the whole wall.

The resulting equation for the film thickness $d$ as a function of height is given (without derivation) as:

$$ d \approx \left( \frac{\alpha}{gh} \right)^{1/n} $$

Since the liquid film will have a non-zero thickness at the top of the container wall it can flow over the wall and then down the outside. Even though the film thicknesses work out to be only a few tens of nanometres the zero viscosity of the superfluid helium allows an appreciable flow rate. Indeed, later in the book flow velocities of 30 cm/s are mentioned.

In principle this would apply to all fluids, however for normal fluids the flow rate in a film a few tens of nanometres thick would be infinitesimally small so the climbing is never observed.

A few comments of my own: I note that this derivation ignores the interfacial tensions of the helium/air, helium/wall and air/wall interfaces. I have no figures for what these would be for superfluid helium and possibly they are negligable. The predictions of the Dzyaloshinskii theory are claimed to agree well with experiment. Also you should note that one of the references provided by Carl challenges the above explanation, though without coming to any firm conclusions.

2329,2329,3712,Equivalent of Java 1.6 @Override for interfaces in C#,"This question gives the answer that Java's @Override has the C# equivalent of the override keyword on methods. However, since Java 1.6 the @Override annotation can be applied to interfaces also.

The practical use for this is that in Java you get compile errors when a class claims it implements an interface method when it no longer does (e.g. if the interface method is removed). Is there equivalent functionality in C#?

Some code examples:

Java:

public interface A {
  public void foo();
  // public void bar(); // Removed method.
}

public class B implements A {
  @Override public void foo();
  @Override public void bar(); // Compile error
}


C#:

public interface IA {
  void Foo();
  // void Bar(); // Removed method.
}

public class B : A {
  public override void Foo(); // Doesn't compile as not 'overriding' method
  public void Bar(); // Compiles, but no longer implements interface method
}

",Bringer128,https://stackoverflow.com/users/545680,"There is similar functionality: explicit interface implementation.

public interface IA { 
  void foo(); 
  // void bar(); // Removed method. 
} 

public class B : IA { 
  void IA.foo() {}
  void IA.bar() {} // does not compile
} 


The problem is that if you do this you cannot call the methods through the this pointer (from inside the class) or through an expression that evaluates to a B -- it is now necessary to cast to IA.

You can work around that by making a public method with the same signature and forwarding the call to the explicit implementation like so:

public class B : IA { 
  void IA.foo() { this.foo(); }
  public void foo() {}
}

2607,2607,4149,Why does resizing PNG with alpha transparency make edges gray?,"I'm using PSP 7 (I know it's old, but it serves my purposes).

I am resizing a bunch of images. PNG images with alpha transparency load with black backgrounds when I first open them. I have little experience with masks. I learned that I can do Masks > Load From Alpha Channel to see the transparent areas.

After loading the alpha channel, I resize the image. Usually, this works fine. However, sometimes the edges look a bit gray - kind of like if I made a transparent GIF on a gray background.

For the record, the box for Resize all layers is checked. If I uncheck that, the edges are black after resize. Also, the original images are already PNG-24 (16 million colors).

It's probably not that noticeable to a lot of people, but the top edge does not look smooth to me.

Is there an easy way to fix this? Do I need to resize the mask separately?

2413,2413,3851,What is temptation?,"Temptation, in the common secular sense, seems to indicate an attraction to something.


  Temptation
  
  
  The act of tempting
  The condition of being tempted.
  Something attractive, tempting or seductive; an inducement or enticement.
  Pressure applied to your thinking designed to create wrong emotions which will eventually lead to wrong actions.
  
  
  Tempting
  
  
  attractive, appealing, enticing
  seductive, alluring, inviting
  
  
  Tempt
  
  
  (transitive) To provoke someone to do wrong, especially by promising a reward; to entice. She tempted me to eat the apple.
  (transitive) To attract; to allure. Its glossy skin tempted me.
  (transitive) To provoke something; to court. It would be tempting fate.
  


But, as with many secular concepts that overlap religious concepts, there are often explicit theological definitions which allow the terminology to fit into religious, dogmatic, and theological discussions with less ambiguity. In this case, is there any predominating Christian/theological definition?

In particular, how is temptation defined or explained in such a manner that allows Christ to have been tempted?

To clarify the problem, if Christ is to be attracted to some thing, there must be some part or aspect of Christ to which some thing appeals. More significantly, Christ, in order to be tempted, must desire that thing if we are to say He is attracted to it. And if Christ is to contain a part or aspect to which some evil may be a temptation, thus arousing a desire, there could be said to be a sinful nature or component in Christ -- a contradiction of His Godliness.

To illustrate the problem, one might select magnetism (or any natural force) as a natural analogy. For the effect of magnetism (sin) to attract (tempt) a material (person), the material must contain, at least to some extent, a magnetic (sinful) component.

Thus, if we say that Christ is tempted in this understanding, we say that He has a sinful component.

How do we Christians, Catholics, or any denomination that has a well-established concept, define or explain temptation in a non-trivial manner without requiring Christ to have a sinful nature?
",svidgen,https://christianity.stackexchange.com/users/3410,"Temptation is one of those words that shows just how.... difficult English can be. 

I am assuming that when you talk about the temptations and Christ, you are talking about the temptations that were apart of his 40 day fast and the ones immediately following that fast?

Now the scripture in Matthew reads: 


  Matt 4: 1,3 ) 1. Then was Jesus led up of the Spirit into the wilderness to be *tempted [sic] of the devil. 3. And when the tempter came to him he said, If thou be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread.


So we have Jesus going up to be tempted, and we have the tempter coming to Him once he is done. 

Now, as noted in your definitions, Temptation can be applied both as a adjective - when it describes a condition one is experiencing - and as a verb - when it describes an action. No where in these verses, does it apply temptation as an adjective that Christ is experiencing. In both verses it is being used in verbal form. First He is going out to be tempted, (be being key here to the verbal application of the word).

Then He is confronted with the tempter, again the verbal form of the word (though it can be confusing because here the verbal form is being used as a pronoun).

If you keep reading and come to Christ's responses, it is fairly evident that tempted is not a good adjective for how He feels when presented with the devil's offers.


  Matt 4: 4,7,10) 4.But he answered and said, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God. 7. Jesus said unto him, It is written again, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God. 10. Then saith Jesus unto him, Get thee hence, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.


None of Christ's answers show any desire to partake of the temptations, or that they provoke any sense of allure in the Savior. In fact He rather forcefully rejects the offers and then casts the tempter out of His presence.

So TL:DR While Christ is presented (verbal form) with temptations, He never feels (adjectival form) the temptations. Hence He does not have a sinful nature. 



*As a side note, in verse 1 of my KJV of the bible the footnotes offer 'tried' or 'tested' as an alternate translation for 'tempted'. This seems to flow better with the fact that the devil shows up only after Christ comes back from the wilderness. (Again, that's just a note and my opinion on the whole scripture, and has nothing to do with my answer!)

  Temptation
  
  
  The act of tempting
  The condition of being tempted.
  Something attractive, tempting or seductive; an inducement or enticement.
  Pressure applied to your thinking designed to create wrong emotions which will eventually lead to wrong actions.
  
  
  Tempting
  
  
  attractive, appealing, enticing
  seductive, alluring, inviting
  
  
  Tempt
  
  
  (transitive) To provoke someone to do wrong, especially by promising a reward; to entice. She tempted me to eat the apple.
  (transitive) To attract; to allure. Its glossy skin tempted me.
  (transitive) To provoke something; to court. It would be tempting fate.
  


But, as with many secular concepts that overlap religious concepts, there are often explicit theological definitions which allow the terminology to fit into religious, dogmatic, and theological discussions with less ambiguity. In this case, is there any predominating Christian/theological definition?

In particular, how is temptation defined or explained in such a manner that allows Christ to have been tempted?

To clarify the problem, if Christ is to be attracted to some thing, there must be some part or aspect of Christ to which some thing appeals. More significantly, Christ, in order to be tempted, must desire that thing if we are to say He is attracted to it. And if Christ is to contain a part or aspect to which some evil may be a temptation, thus arousing a desire, there could be said to be a sinful nature or component in Christ -- a contradiction of His Godliness.

  The correct serial length will take longer to process than an incorrect serial length. Even better (for attacker), a serial number

5761,5761,9129,matlab fft phase response square wave,"I am new to phase analysis, recently I have been trying compare the phase between the input signal and output signal of a system. From the code below, I simulated a square wave and plotted the phase, from basic theory, I thought that since this is a simulated signal, I should get near zero values other than the values at each input frequency. So my questions are (based on the following code): 

1) Why does Matlab give me pi/2 as phase response of actual input signals, I don't understand the calculation behind it (does it have to do with my signal being sine and not cosine?)

2) If I don't filter out low (near zero) values, the phase response is a sloping line that goes toward very large numbers, and seems to be proportional to the number of samples of FFT I have, is this due to how unwrap works?

3) If I am trying to compare an input signal vs output signal, both of which for the sake of argument looks similar to the square wave I simulated, how do I determine if the system is linear phased? (from theory, the phase delay should be the same therefore, after finding the phase response, should I check if the difference of phase for each input signal between output and input is constant? 

4) Also, group delay is considered as the derivative of phase response, and phase delay is the normalization of phase with respect to its corresponding frequency, a perfect square wave should have constant values at each harmonic for group delay and phase delay shouldn't it?, if so can I somehow see this result in my simulation?

2076,2076,3307,How to easily determine the results distribution for multiple dice?,"I want to calculate the probability distribution for the total of a combination of dice. 

I remember that the probability of is the number of combinations that total that number over the total number of combinations (assuming the dice have a uniform distribution). 

What are the formulas for


The number of combinations total
The number of combinations that total a certain number

",C. Ross,https://stats.stackexchange.com/users/1456,"There's a very neat way of computing the combinations or probabilities in a spreadsheet (such as excel) that computes the convolutions directly. 

I'll do it in terms of probabilities and illustrate it for six sided dice but you can do it for dice with any number of sides (including adding different ones).

(btw it's also easy in something like R or matlab that will do convolutions)

Start with a clean sheet, in a few columns, and move down a bunch of rows from the top (more than 6).


put the value 1 in a cell. That's the probabilities associated with 0 dice. put a 0 to its left; that's the value column - continue down from there with 1,2,3 down as far as you need.
move one column to the right and down a row from the '1'. enter the formula ""=sum("" then left-arrow up-arrow (to highlight the cell with 1 in it), hit "":"" (to start entering a range) and then up-arrow 5 times, followed by "")/6"" and press Enter - so you end up with a formula like =sum(c4:c9)/6  (where here C9 is the cell with the 1 in it).



Then copy the formula and paste it to the 5 cells below it. They should each contain 0.16667 (ish).



Don't type anything into the empty cells these formulas refer to!
move down 1 and to the right 1 from the top of that column of values and paste ...



... a total of another 11 values. These will be the probabilities for two dice. 



It doesn't matter if you paste a few too many, you'll just get zeroes.
repeat step 3 for the next column for three dice, and again for four, five, etc dice.



We see here that the probability of rolling $12$ on 4d6 is 0.096451  (if you multiply by $4^6$ you'll be able to write it as an exact fraction).


If you're adept with Excel - things like copying a formula from a cell and pasting into many cells in a column, you can generate all tables up to say 10d6 in about a minute or so (possibly faster if you've done it a few times).



If you want combination counts instead of probabilities, don't divide by 6.

If you want dice with different numbers of faces, you can sum $k$ (rather than 6) cells and then divide by $k$. You can mix dice across columns (e.g. do a column for d6 and one for d8 to get the probability function for d6+d8):

We see here that the probability of rolling $12$ on 4d6 is 0.096451  (if you multiply by $4^6$ you'll be able to write it as an exact fraction).


If you're adept with Excel - things like copying a formula from a cell and pasting into many cells in a column, you can generate all tables up to say 10d6 in about a minute or so (possibly faster if you've done it a few times).



If you want combination counts instead of probabilities, don't divide by 6.

If you want dice with different numbers of faces, you can sum $k$ (rather than 6) cells and then divide by $k$. You can mix dice across columns (e.g. do a column for d6 and one for d8 to get the probability function for d6+d8):

The number of combinations total
The number of combinations that total a certain number

",C. Ross,https://stats.stackexchange.com/users/1456,"Exact solutions

The number of combinations in $n$ throws is of course $6^n$.

These calculations are most readily done using the probability generating function for one die,

$$p(x) = x + x^2 + x^3 + x^4 + x^5 + x^6 = x \frac{1-x^6}{1-x}.$$

(Actually this is $6$ times the pgf--I'll take care of the factor of $6$ at the end.)

The pgf for $n$ rolls is $p(x)^n$.  We can calculate this fairly directly--it's not a closed form but it's a useful one--using the Binomial Theorem:

$$p(x)^n = x^n (1 - x^6)^n (1 - x)^{-n}$$

$$= x^n (\sum_{k=0}^{n} {n \choose k} (-1)^k x^{6k} )( \sum_{j=0}^{\infty} {-n \choose j} (-1)^j x^j).$$

The number of ways to obtain a sum equal to $m$ on the dice is the coefficient of $x^m$ in this product, which we can isolate as

$$\sum_{6k + j = m - n} {n \choose k}{-n \choose j}(-1)^{k+j}.$$

The sum is over all nonnegative $k$ and $j$ for which $6k + j = m - n$; it therefore is finite and has only about $(m-n)/6$ terms.  For example, the number of ways to total $m = 14$ in $n = 3$ throws is a sum of just two terms, because $11 = 14-3$ can be written only as $6 \cdot 0 + 11$ and $6 \cdot 1 + 5$:

$$-{3 \choose 0} {-3 \choose 11} + {3 \choose 1}{-3 \choose 5}$$

$$= 1 \frac{(-3)(-4)\cdots(-13)}{11!} + 3 \frac{(-3)(-4)\cdots(-7)}{5!}$$

$$= \frac{1}{2} 12 \cdot 13 - \frac{3}{2} 6 \cdot 7 = 15.$$

(You can also be clever and note that the answer will be the same for $m = 7$ by the symmetry 1 &lt;--> 6, 2 &lt;--> 5, and 3 &lt;--> 4 and there's only one way to expand $7 - 3$ as $6 k + j$; namely, with $k = 0$ and $j = 4$, giving

$$ {3 \choose 0}{-3 \choose 4} = 15 \text{.)}$$

The probability therefore equals $15/6^3$ = $5/36$, about 14%.

By the time this gets painful, the Central Limit Theorem provides good approximations (at least to the central terms where $m$ is between $\frac{7 n}{2} - 3 \sqrt{n}$ and $\frac{7 n}{2} + 3 \sqrt{n}$: on a relative basis, the approximations it affords for the tail values get worse and worse as $n$ grows large).

I see that this formula is given in the Wikipedia article Srikant references but no justification is supplied nor are examples given.  If perchance this approach looks too abstract, fire up your favorite computer algebra system and ask it to expand the $n^{\text{th}}$ power of $x + x^2 + \cdots + x^6$: you can read the whole set of values right off.

  If an exchange facilitates the trading of futures contracts and nobody intends to take delivery of the product, nor do they own it so they can deliver it, then how are the contracts issued? 


Say I want to buy a future contract that allows me to buy coffee at a given price in December 2013. Technically, this contract allows me to buy 37,500 pounds of coffee at the specified price in December 2013. I have two options. If the contract already exists in the market (this contract does), I can simply purchase the contract in the market. If it doesn't exist, however, the process works like this: 

I approach a futures commission merchant, who sends the buy order to a broker on the trading floor/pit or to the exchange order system. Assuming someone else has put in a sell order for the same commodity, expiration, etc. the orders are matched at the agreed upon price, and the futures contract is created.

Also, the FCM reports the trade to the exchange's clearing house, which guarantees the trade and removes counter-party risk. In other words, if the price of coffee changes dramatically, and one of the parties in the trade cannot meet its buy or sell obligation, there isn't a default. The clearing house settles the trade.


  Is there a fixed number of contracts that are created and traded, or is there an ""unlimited"" number of contracts? 


No, there is no fixed number. The Wikipedia article on futures exchanges sums this up:


  Futures contracts are not issued like other securities, but are ""created"" whenever Open interest increases; that is, when one party first buys (goes long) a contract from another party (who goes short). Contracts are also ""destroyed"" in the opposite manner whenever Open interest decreases because traders resell to reduce their long positions or rebuy to reduce their short positions.





  If none of the traders intend to take delivery nor do they want to deliver, then where do the sellers get the contracts to sell? How does that process work? 


The futures market doesn't consist of only traders. The terminology that you usually hear are speculators and hedgers. Speculators are the traders you're thinking of, while hedgers are farmers, oil producers, or companies that rely on commodities. All of these groups enter the futures market in order to lock in a future price at which to buy or sell the products they need, in order to protect themselves from future price swings.

For example, if I'm an oil producer like ExxonMobil, the price of oil significantly affects my future revenue. The price of Brent crude oil is currently around $108/barrel. If this price increases to $120/barrel in a year, they may earn much more revenue. However, if the price drops to $80/barrel, however, their revenue stream is negatively affected. Therefore, I go to the futures market and sell a futures contract that expires in one year and allows me to sell oil for $108/barrel.

If the price of oil jumps to $120/barrel in one year, I would have been better off without a futures contract. However, if the price drops to $80/barrel, I saved myself a considerable loss. This is how the futures market lowers risk and helps to smooth commodity prices in the long run. 

Who takes the other side of the trade? Consider an airline company that knows it will need oil1 for its planes in a year. The airline company will earn more revenue if the price of oil drops to $80/barrel (the exact opposite of ExxonMobil), but lose revenue if the price jumps to $120/barrel. The airline may decide to enter the futures market and agree to buy oil at $108/barrel in one year, thus completing the trade. The futures contract is created and traded in the market.2 3

Expiration

When the contract expires, the buyer/seller either takes delivery of the commodity or the contract is settled for cash between parties. As maturity nears, the price of the contract usually converges to the spot price. Consider our example oil contract, which was created at $108/barrel. If in one year, the spot price of oil has increased to $120/barrel, the contract's price will converge to $120/barrel. Exxon received $108 for its sale of the contract, and now owes $120 in cash or $120 in oil. The cost of its hedge was $12. The airline company bought the contract for $108, and now receives $120. It profited $12 from its hedge, so Exxon would pay the airline company $12. Exxon could sell oil for $120/barrel, but because of the cost of its hedge, it's only receiving $108/barrel, exactly the price it locked in by selling the contract in the first place.

Consider what happens if the price of oil had decreased to $80/barrel. Exxon received $108 for its sale of the contract, and now owes only $80, for a profit of $28. The airline company, however, paid $108, but only received $80 in return, for a loss of $28, so the airline company would pay Exxon $28. Similar to above, Exxon can only fetch $80/barrel for its oil in the spot market, but because it earned $28/barrel by selling a futures contract, it's really receiving $108/barrel for the barrels in the contract.



1 In reality, planes don't run on oil; they run on jet fuel. Since there isn't a futures contract for jet fuel, the airline could study the past relationship between prices of jet fuel and oil in order to estimate the future price of jet fuel, given a future price of oil. Since the company can lock in the price of oil through a futures contract, they'll lock in a price of oil that, based on their estimated model of jet fuel/oil prices, will give them enough funds to purchase the appropriate amount of jet fuel.

2 It's also important to understand that not all hedgers will operate this way. It's certainly possible for a company to hedge too much, and therefore not benefit at all if the price swings in their favor. This has happened to airline companies in the past; even when oil prices have fallen, they haven't benefited because their hedges were expensive enough to outweigh the potential gain. However, had the price increased dramatically, their hedge would have been highly effective. 

3 Also, in this simple example, two companies may choose to bypass the futures market all together and create an over-the-counter (OTC) contract instead. For example, ExxonMobil could agree to sell oil to a specific company at $108/barrel in one year, without entering the futures market at all. This option may be cheaper than entering the futures market, but futures markets also have the benefit of clearing houses to mitigate counterparty risk. If Exxon agrees to sell oil to a company, which then goes bankrupt, Exxon is protected if the hedging was done through the futures market. In the OTC market, this protection isn't always there. OTC contracts can be useful, however, if (for example), the company wants to make or take delivery of a commodity at a different location than that specified in the standardized contracts available on an exchange.

The airline company, however, paid $108, but only received $80 in return, for a loss of $28, so the airline company would pay Exxon $28. Similar to above, Exxon can only fetch $80/barrel for its oil in the spot market, but because it earned $28/barrel by selling a futures contract, it's really receiving $108/barrel for the barrels in the contract.



1 In reality, planes don't run on oil; they run on jet fuel. Since there isn't a futures contract for jet fuel, the airline could study the past relationship between prices of jet fuel and oil in order to estimate the future price of jet fuel, given a future price of oil. Since the company can lock in the price of oil through a futures contract, they'll lock in a price of oil that, based on their estimated model of jet fuel/oil prices, will give them enough funds to purchase the appropriate amount of jet fuel.

2 It's also important to understand that not all hedgers will operate this way. It's certainly possible for a company to hedge too much, and therefore not benefit at all if the price swings in their favor. This has happened to airline companies in the past; even when oil prices have fallen, they haven't benefited because their hedges were expensive enough to outweigh the potential gain. However, had the price increased dramatically, their hedge would have been highly effective. 

3 Also, in this simple example, two companies may choose to bypass the futures market all together and create an over-the-counter (OTC) contract instead. For example, ExxonMobil could agree to sell oil to a specific company at $108/barrel in one year, without entering the futures market at all. This option may be cheaper than entering the futures market, but futures markets also have the benefit of clearing houses to mitigate counterparty risk. If Exxon agrees to sell oil to a company, which then goes bankrupt, Exxon is protected if the hedging was done through the futures market. In the OTC market, this protection isn't always there. OTC contracts can be useful, however, if (for example), the company wants to make or take delivery of a commodity at a different location than that specified in the standardized contracts available on an exchange.

894,894,1418,What to do in case of low inter-rater reliability (ICC)?,"Background: Eight doctors each rated the same 54 patients on a persuasiveness measure (1-7 Likert scale). The mean score on the persuasiveness measure will eventually be the outcome measure of my experiment. 

Inter-rater reliability was quantified as the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), using the two-way random effects model with consistency. Unfortunately, the inter-rater reliability of the eight doctors was low (ICC = .350, single measures). Should I still run further planned analyses with these unreliable data? Or can it possibly be justified that I only include the doctors (i.e., raters) with the highest inter-rater reliability? I found out there are two doctors with a more acceptable inter-rater reliability (ICC = .718, N = 2), but I don't think this is enough reason to exclude the other doctors from analyses. I would really appreciate any references to literature that deals with this problem.

In another context, I assisted in working on a ratings and classification system, and found that inter-rater agreement was disappointingly low.  Two paths were considered


Change how rating agreements were defined and identify those who seemed to ""understand"" the task, or
Refine the definitions used, along with the guidance and examples provider to raters, so that they could more easily understand how to rate things.


In the first sceneario, the whole methodology and results could be rendered a waste simply because the inter-rater reliability was low.  It indicated that either the original definitions were bad or that the raters were given poor instructions.  If I proceeded along that path, I was sure to have problems.

In the second case, the agreement between raters was very good.  Since they rated quite a lot of items, they could also give feedback with when they thought the original definitions and guidance were inadequate.  In the end, the methodology was very reproducible.

Based on that, I would not yet modify your set of raters, but return to the original definitions and guidance.  Any tinkering after the rating is a problem, though it can be useful as a quality check.  There are sometimes raters that are going to do what they want, no matter the guidance given.  With good statistical methods, it is easy to identify them and weight their contributions appropriately.

Now, if I'm mistaken and you don't plan to do further collection, i.e. your data is already collected and done, what you may do is PCA or something like it, and see if you can get a sense of how the different doctors (or patients) cluster.

By adding a ""connection"" similarly as what is done in general relativity or gauge theories. And if not, why?
",Learning is a mess,https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/16890,"I) Here we discuss the problem of defining a connection on a conformal manifold $M$. We start with a conformal class $[g_{\mu\nu}]$ of globally$^{1}$ defined metrics 

$$\tag{1} g^{\prime}_{\mu\nu}~=~\Omega^2 g_{\mu\nu}$$

given by Weyl transformations/rescalings. Under mild assumption about the manifold $M$ (para-compactness), we may assume that there exists a conformal class $[A_{\mu}]$ of globally defined co-vectors/one-forms connected via Weyl transformations as

$$\tag{2} A^{\prime}_{\mu}~=~A_{\mu} + \partial_{\mu}\ln(\Omega^2). $$

In particular it is implicitly understood that a Weyl transformation [of a pair $(g_{\mu\nu},A_{\mu})$ of representatives] act in tandem/is synchronized with the same globally defined function $\Omega$ in eqs. (1) and (2) simultaneously.

II) Besides Weyl transformations, we can act (in the active picture) with diffeomorphisms. Locally, in the passive picture, the pair $(g_{\mu\nu},A_{\mu})$ transforms as covariant tensors

$$ \tag{3} g_{\mu\nu}~=~ \frac{\partial  x^{\prime \rho}}{\partial x^{\mu}} g^{\prime}_{\rho\sigma}\frac{\partial  x^{\prime \sigma}}{\partial x^{\nu}},  $$

$$ \tag{4} A_{\mu}~=~ \frac{\partial  x^{\prime \nu}}{\partial x^{\mu}} A^{\prime}_{\nu}. $$

under general coordinate transformations 

$$ \tag{5} x^{\mu} ~\longrightarrow~ x^{\prime \nu}~= ~f^{\nu}(x). $$

III) We next introduce the unique torsionfree tangent-space Weyl connection $\nabla$ with corresponding Christoffel symbols $\Gamma^{\lambda}_{\mu\nu}$ that covariantly preserves the metric in the following sense:

$$ \tag{6} (\nabla_{\lambda}-A_{\lambda})g_{\mu\nu}~=~0. $$

The Weyl connection $\nabla$ and its Christoffel symbols $\Gamma^{\lambda}_{\mu\nu}$ are independent of the pair $(g_{\mu\nu},A_{\mu})$ of representatives within the conformal class $[(g_{\mu\nu},A_{\mu})]$. (But the construction depends of course on the conformal class $[(g_{\mu\nu},A_{\mu})]$.) In other words, the Weyl Christoffel symbols are invariant under Weyl transformations 

$$ \tag{7} \Gamma^{\prime\lambda}_{\mu\nu}~=~\Gamma^{\lambda}_{\mu\nu}.$$ 

The lowered Weyl Christoffel symbols are uniquely given by

$$ \Gamma_{\lambda,\mu\nu}~=~g_{\lambda\rho}  \Gamma^{\rho}_{\mu\nu} $$
$$ ~=~\frac{1}{2}\left((\partial_{\mu}-A_{\mu})g_{\nu\lambda} +(\partial_{\nu}-A_{\nu})g_{\mu\lambda}-(\partial_{\lambda}-A_{\lambda})g_{\mu\nu} \right) $$
$$\tag{8} ~=~\Gamma^{(g)}_{\lambda,\mu\nu}+\frac{1}{2}\left(A_{\mu}g_{\nu\lambda}-A_{\nu}g_{\mu\lambda}+A_{\lambda}g_{\mu\nu} \right), $$

where $\Gamma^{(g)}_{\lambda,\mu\nu}$ denote the lowered Levi-Civita Christoffel symbols for the representative $g_{\mu\nu}$. 
The lowered Weyl Christoffel symbols $\Gamma_{\lambda,\mu\nu}$ scale under Weyl transformations as

$$ \tag{9} \Gamma^{\prime}_{\lambda,\mu\nu}~=~\Omega^2\Gamma_{\lambda,\mu\nu}.$$ 

The corresponding determinant bundle has a Weyl connection given by

$$ \tag{10} \Gamma_{\lambda}~=~\Gamma^{\mu}_{\lambda\mu}~=~(\partial_{\lambda}-A_{\lambda})\ln \sqrt{\det(g_{\mu\nu})}.$$

IV) Let us next define a conformal class $[\rho]$ of a density $\rho$ of weights $(w,h)$, who scales under Weyl transformations as

$$  \tag{11} \rho^{\prime}~=~ \Omega^w\rho $$

with Weyl weight $w$, and as a density

$$\tag{12} \rho^{\prime}~=~\frac{\rho}{J^h}$$

of weight $h$ under general coordinate transformations (5). Here

$$\tag{13} J ~:=~\det(\frac{\partial x^{\prime \nu}}{\partial x^{\mu}}) $$

is the Jacobian. 

Example: The determinant $\det(g_{\mu\nu})$ is a density with $h=2$ and $w=2d$, where $d$ is the dimension of the manifold $M$.

V) The concept of (conformal classes of) densities $\rho$ of weights $(w,h)$ can be generalized to (conformal classes of) tensor densities $T^{\mu_1\ldots\mu_m}_{\nu_1\ldots\nu_n}$ of weights $(w,h)$ in a straightforward manner. For instance, a vector density  of weights $(w,h)$ transforms as

$$ \tag{14} \xi^{\prime \mu}~=~ \frac{1}{J^h}\frac{\partial  x^{\prime \mu}}{\partial x^{\nu}} \xi^{\nu} $$

under general coordinate transformations (5), and scales as 

$$ \tag{15} \xi^{\prime \mu}~=~\Omega^w \xi^{\mu} $$

under Weyl transformations. Similarly, a co-vector density of weights $(w,h)$ transforms as

$$ \tag{16} \eta^{\prime}_{\mu}~=~ \frac{1}{J^h}\frac{\partial x^{\nu}}{\partial  x^{\prime \mu}} \eta_{\nu} $$

under general coordinate transformations (5), and scales as 

$$ \tag{17} \eta^{\prime}_{\mu}~=~\Omega^w \eta_{\mu} $$

under Weyl transformations. And so forth for arbitrary tensor densities $T^{\mu_1\ldots\mu_m}_{\nu_1\ldots\nu_n}$.

Example: The metric $g_{\mu\nu}$ is a tensor density with $h=0$ and $w=2$. The one-form $A_{\mu}$ is not a tensor density, cf. eq. (2). 

VI) Finally, one can discuss the definition of covariantly conserved (conformal classes of) tensor densities $T^{\mu_1\ldots\mu_m}_{\nu_1\ldots\nu_n}$. A density $\rho$ of weights $(w,h)$ is covariantly conserved if

$$\tag{18} (\nabla_{\lambda}-\frac{w}{2}A_{\lambda})\rho~\equiv~ (\partial_{\lambda}-h \Gamma_{\lambda}-\frac{w}{2}A_{\lambda})\rho~=~0. $$

A vector density of weights $(w,h)$ is covariantly conserved if

$$\tag{19}  (\nabla_{\lambda}-\frac{w}{2}A_{\lambda})\xi^{\mu}~\equiv~ (\partial_{\lambda}-h \Gamma_{\lambda}-\frac{w}{2}A_{\lambda})\xi^{\mu}+\Gamma_{\lambda\nu}^{\mu}\xi^{\nu} ~=~0. $$

A co-vector density of weights $(w,h)$ is covariantly conserved if

$$\tag{20}(\nabla_{\lambda}-\frac{w}{2}A_{\lambda})\eta_{\mu}~\equiv~  (\partial_{\lambda}-h \Gamma_{\lambda}-\frac{w}{2}A_{\lambda})\eta_{\mu}-\Gamma_{\lambda\mu}^{\nu}\eta_{\nu} ~=~0. $$

In particular, if $T^{\mu_1\ldots\mu_m}_{\nu_1\ldots\nu_n}$ is a tensor density of weights $(w,h)$, then the covariant derivative $(\nabla_{\lambda}-\frac{w}{2}A_{\lambda})T^{\mu_1\ldots\mu_m}_{\nu_1\ldots\nu_n}$ is also a tensor density of weights $(w,h)$.

My personal recommendation is starting with a imperial guard series like gaunts ghosts or the lay chancers. They will give you a perspective of the average human. After that a space marine or a inquisition based series would be wise. The blood angels series is one i recommend due to its strong imagery and good story. After that it is up to you.  The list i have is a expanded version of horus's answer minus the few i have not read.

Eisenhorn / Ravenor: Covers the Inquisition and the different Ordos. My personal favorite was the Ravenor series.  

Ciaphas Cain: Hero of the Imperium / Ciaphas Cain: Defender of the Imperium  by Sandy Mitchell:  My one of my favorite series. The plot revolves around a hero of the Empire who believes himself to be a coward. Very light hearted compared to other series.

Ultramarines: A standard space marine series with themes of honor and duty. A great world but the characters are a little dry. The  enemies are chaos and tyranids. 

Grey Knights: I also enjoyed this series. Covering the grey knights and their wars against deamons. It covers the inquisition and its methods and it s relation to the grey knights. 

Gaunt's Ghosts: an imperial guard series, among my friends it is either hated or loved. This series is considered the bread and butter of the imperial guard stories. The overall feel is that of band of brothers or another world war 2 series. 

Blood Angels: A great story about a pair of brothers in the blood angel legion. I read the omnibus and i would recommend you do that also, there is a short story that reveals a another dimension the antagonist.

5672,5672,8993,Why does my bike make a noise when I pedal hard?,"When I pedal forcing a little with my right leg, the bike makes a noise that I don't know how to describe. I'll try to do it. It's like:


a short ""ting""
a tiny bell
if a small rock hits the down tube


I don't know what is causing this noise, but I think that it could be any of this things:


pedal
crank arm/pedal connection
crankset


I think the material of all these things is alluminium.

I don't feel anything (like a bad shifted chain) when I hear the noise.

It happens when there is movement and when there is NO movement (I use the brake, so the bike doesn'e move, stand using all weight on right pedal, and it makes the noise)

The pedals could be in any position, It is not in a particular position. Just pressing the right pedal.

Has someone else has this ""problem""? Any ideas of where this comes from?

Update:
Yesterday I took out the chain and stood on the right pedal, and made the noise. Then is not the chain, nor the transmission system.

I put oil in the pedal axis, but had no luck. Also tried to loose the pedal, but the juncture point is too tight, and I couldn't.

Today I will try to use oil in the bottom bracket.

2964,2964,4716,CMS Uses http and so sends password in plain text,"A well known CMS called Joomla allows users to register and the password appears hidden as you register with dots a normal experience online - at this point you think just you know it. But if the site is using http then in fact the password is POSTed using plaintext.

This shouldn't be allowed!

I can understand that passwords are stored as salted hashes in good systems so even if the passwords are discovered on the db you cant use them to login.

Is that pretty much it? 

Before we talk about password reset - in this case a good system cannot remind you of your password as it is not recoverable! It can only reset it for you and again isn't this sent plaintext over the net ??? So why cant that get stolen..

The issue is when the real plain text passwords are known by anyone or any system other than the user then identity is lost. 
",landed,https://security.stackexchange.com/users/12050,"You have to use https.  This is not a responsibility of the CMS application, but a responsibility of the person deploying the system, to purchase a signed SSL certificate from a known trusted certificate authority (note you can purchase for free from say http://www.startssl.com or included in the cost of your domain registration at say http://gandi.net ) and force all traffic to be only sent via HTTPS.

Even if the CMS application say hashed your password client-side (using say javascript), sent the hashed password over the network, and then checked the hash server-side, the hashed password (say hash=bcrypt('Correct Horse Battery Staple', salt)= '$2a$14$XUgYF0o3flsoGam2GHiw8OlQv9BBR/ihAwS/k83fZk.YjJ1hA/04.')
 would still be sent over in plaintext for anyone to eavesdrop.  These eavesdroppers would still be able to do a replay attack (e.g., modify the client-side javascript to instead of hash an entered password, to just send back the captured hashed password $2a$14$XUgYF0o3flsoGam2GHiw8OlQv9BBR/ihAwS/k83fZk.YjJ1hA/04.) that they intercepted.

But if the site is using http then in fact the password is POSTed using plaintext.

This shouldn't be allowed!

I can understand that passwords are stored as salted hashes in good systems so even if the passwords are discovered on the db you cant use them to login.

Is that pretty much it? 

Before we talk about password reset - in this case a good system cannot remind you of your password as it is not recoverable! It can only reset it for you and again isn't this sent plaintext over the net ??? So why cant that get stolen..

The issue is when the real plain text passwords are known by anyone or any system other than the user then identity is lost. 
","You have to use https.  This is not a responsibility of the CMS application, but a responsibility of the person deploying the system, to purchase a signed SSL certificate from a known trusted certificate authority (note you can purchase for free from say http://www.startssl.com or included in the cost of your domain registration at say http://gandi.net ) and force all traffic to be only sent via HTTPS.

Even if the CMS application say hashed your password client-side (using say javascript), sent the hashed password over the network, and then checked the hash server-side, the hashed password (say hash=bcrypt('Correct Horse Battery Staple', salt)= '$2a$14$XUgYF0o3flsoGam2GHiw8OlQv9BBR/ihAwS/k83fZk.YjJ1hA/04.')
 would still be sent over in plaintext for anyone to eavesdrop.  These eavesdroppers would still be able to do a replay attack (e.g., modify the client-side javascript to instead of hash an entered password, to just send back the captured hashed password $2a$14$XUgYF0o3flsoGam2GHiw8OlQv9BBR/ihAwS/k83fZk.YjJ1hA/04.) that they intercepted.

For example: Specialized All Condition Armadillo Tyre

Even though these tires are not really puncture proof, they do reduce a lot the chances of puncturing. So the advantage is obvious.

Apparently, they're not too expensive compared to regular tires. So, I was wondering why people would choose not to use these more resistant tires. What are their disadvantages?
",b.roth,https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/users/131,"The obvious advantage is puncture resistance

There are several disadvantages:


weight
rolling resistance
grip
ride
cost


There are several levels of puncture resistance and a Kevlar belt is not the only means.

Let me tell you a story.  After two years on a tire with moderate puncture resistance got my first flat and had to walk it home.  I got on-line and bought THE most puncture resistant tire I could find ignoring all other factors.  It is twice as heavy as the old tire (and feels twice as heavy), noticeably more rolling resistance, less grip, terrible grip in wet, and a harsh ride.  I don't like it.  If I get zero flats in two years compared to one not worth it.

Even racing tires typically come with some puncture resistance. Some time trial tires have none.

Means of puncture resistance


Puncture resistant material such as Kevlar.
There are other materials such as Duraskin by Continental. 
The material may be only on the tread strip or include sidewall. 
Can even have a combination like a Gator Hard Shell.  
Material in tread strip
Not material specifically designed for puncture resistance - more material. 
Rubber or SmartGuard. Make the glass or thorn travel further. 
An example is the Marathon Plus HS 440.
Harder rubber
Bounce glass and thorns off and also slow them down if they do penetrate 


Pick your level of protection


Puncture resistant material in tread only
This adds puncture resistance at a very small performance impact. 
Comes in all but very very cheap tires. 
Most racing tires even have this.
Puncture resistant material(s) in tread and sidewall
Adds even more puncture resistance at still a very small performance impact. 
At this level it is more just a cost thing. 
A cheap tire is not going to have this extra material. 
An expensive tire will have better puncture resistance, performance, and ride compared to a  cheap tire.
More material (e.g. rubber)
Adds more puncture resistance but now you get into noticeable performance impacts.   
Harder rubber
Harsher ride and less traction.

3805,3805,6048,Do delegates defy OOP,"I'm trying to understand OOP so I can write better OOP code and one thing which keeps coming up is this concept of a delegate (using .NET). I could have an object, which is totally self contained (encapsulated); it knows nothing of the outside world... but then I attach a delegate to it. 

In my head, this is still quite well separated as the delegate only knows what to reference, but this by itself means it has to know about something else outside it's world! That a method exists within another class!

Have I got myself it total muddle here, or is this a grey area, or is this actually down to interpretation (and if so, sorry as that will be off topic I'm sure). My question is, do delegates defy/muddy the OOP pattern?
",Dave,https://programmers.stackexchange.com/users/72130,"No. Encapsulation doesn't insist that an object ""not know anything about the outside world."" It generally says two things:


Other objects don't need to know how an objects does what it says it does.
All methods and attributes related only to serving a particular class are contained in that class.


The second point is often stated in various manners that can gives an impression that objects shouldn't rely on outside stuff; but this is a highly impractical understanding, if not an impossible one. Consider a really basic class:

class Document {
  public String Title;
  public String Body;
}


Even without any further definition, our Document class already knows about ""outside"" things: It knows about Strings! (String is an externally defined class.) And, ignoring the potential XSS issues for a moment, we might make a method that looks like this:

public String GetHtmlBlurb() {
  return ""&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;"" + Title.Substring(0, 60) + ""&lt;/b&gt; ""
    + body.Substring(0, 120) + ""&lt;/div&gt;"";
}


The Substring method doesn't exist in our Document definition either! It's an externally defined method in the String class! But, this is perfectly expected, acceptable, generally necessary OO code. With the exception of classes built exclusively around primitives (do primitives really even exist in .NET?), a class is defined in terms of other classes (external stuff, the outside world, etc.).

Regarding delegates, we could have similarly defined our Document to work with a variety of Body types we have no other information about. All we might require is some way of producing a substring wherein there are multiple ways of doing so (perhaps one version adds elipses in certain cases). All our Document cares about is the ability to call some method that claims to be a Subtring-like method.

  public String Title;
  public Func&lt;Int32, Int32, String&gt; BodySubstring;

In brief: A delegate is just a reference to a method, rather than the full object we might otherwise include as a property. The difference is that our delegate doesn't require the object to be of a certain type: only that a particular method have a certain signature. Our class doesn't know what the object does and doesn't insist on knowing anything about it. So, in that respect, it actually knows less about ""the outside world.""

5313,5313,8439,Why does my bike make a noise when I pedal hard?,"When I pedal forcing a little with my right leg, the bike makes a noise that I don't know how to describe. I'll try to do it. It's like:


a short ""ting""
a tiny bell
if a small rock hits the down tube


I don't know what is causing this noise, but I think that it could be any of this things:


pedal
crank arm/pedal connection
crankset


I think the material of all these things is alluminium.

I don't feel anything (like a bad shifted chain) when I hear the noise.

It happens when there is movement and when there is NO movement (I use the brake, so the bike doesn'e move, stand using all weight on right pedal, and it makes the noise)

The pedals could be in any position, It is not in a particular position. Just pressing the right pedal.

Has someone else has this ""problem""? Any ideas of where this comes from?

Update:
Yesterday I took out the chain and stood on the right pedal, and made the noise. Then is not the chain, nor the transmission system.

I put oil in the pedal axis, but had no luck. Also tried to loose the pedal, but the juncture point is too tight, and I couldn't.

Today I will try to use oil in the bottom bracket.

Update: here is a link to info on the bike http://www.diamondback.com/2012-sorrento maybe it helps to know the model of all the components.
",jperelli,https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/users/5398,"Could be any number of things.  The first thing to check (because ignoring it can rapidly cause expensive damage) is that the crank arms are tight.  Even if they don't seem loose it doesn't hurt to put a wrench on the fixing bolts and torque them a bit.  (If one moves more than a small amount, get a torque wrench and do them up right.)  Likewise with the pedals.

You can also get noise from a cartridge BB if the cups are not totally tight. No big emergency here, but you need to tighten them to see if that's the problem.

Spokes can make a ""ting"" sound, especially if the wheel is relatively new.  Unless there are loose spokes, though, there's not much you can do about this and it will usually go away on its own after the wheel breaks in.

It's unlikely to be that the BB needs lube, unless it's been sorely neglected for years (or submerged in Sandy's tidal waters).

If the bike is relatively new (a few months old), you should take it back to the shop where you bought it and ask for a ""tuneup"" where they would tighten the crank arms, adjust the brakes and shifters, and true up the wheels.  On a new bike they should do this for free or for a nominal sum.

If the bike's older a tuneup won't hurt, but expect to pay more.

It happens when there is movement and when there is NO movement (I use the brake, so the bike doesn'e move, stand using all weight on right pedal, and it makes the noise)

The pedals could be in any position, It is not in a particular position. Just pressing the right pedal.

Has someone else has this ""problem""? Any ideas of where this comes from?

Update:
Yesterday I took out the chain and stood on the right pedal, and made the noise. Then is not the chain, nor the transmission system.

I put oil in the pedal axis, but had no luck. Also tried to loose the pedal, but the juncture point is too tight, and I couldn't.

Today I will try to use oil in the bottom bracket.

Update: here is a link to info on the bike http://www.diamondback.com/2012-sorrento maybe it helps to know the model of all the components.
","Could be any number of things.  The first thing to check (because ignoring it can rapidly cause expensive damage) is that the crank arms are tight.  Even if they don't seem loose it doesn't hurt to put a wrench on the fixing bolts and torque them a bit.  (If one moves more than a small amount, get a torque wrench and do them up right.)  Likewise with the pedals.

You can also get noise from a cartridge BB if the cups are not totally tight. No big emergency here, but you need to tighten them to see if that's the problem.

Spokes can make a ""ting"" sound, especially if the wheel is relatively new.  Unless there are loose spokes, though, there's not much you can do about this and it will usually go away on its own after the wheel breaks in.

It's unlikely to be that the BB needs lube, unless it's been sorely neglected for years (or submerged in Sandy's tidal waters).

If the bike is relatively new (a few months old), you should take it back to the shop where you bought it and ask for a ""tuneup"" where they would tighten the crank arms, adjust the brakes and shifters, and true up the wheels.  On a new bike they should do this for free or for a nominal sum.

If the bike's older a tuneup won't hurt, but expect to pay more.

$model = Mage::getModel('customer/address');

doing this correctly sets the values of AttrA, AttrB and AttrC but value of parent_id in customer_entity sets to NULL by default.

After loading the alpha channel, I resize the image. Usually, this works fine. However, sometimes the edges look a bit gray - kind of like if I made a transparent GIF on a gray background.

in pgfmanual 2.10 on page 25 it says: 


  Note that pgf/TikZ is not supported by recent ConTEXt versions (like mark IV, the LuaTEX-aware part of ConTEXt).

TikZ is supported in the current ConTeXt. However, there are not many people using TikZ in ConTeXt. That, in turn, means that bugs are not detected that easily. When you translate the LaTeX specific commands that are used in the manual (e.g. font switching commands) to ConTeXt-flavoured ones, you should get the desired result.

When the file compiles, but the output is unexpected, a look at the logfile almost always tells you what is wrong. You, in your particular example are missing the \usetikzlibrary[positioning] call.

You have a hash called %hash that is keyed by $loginId. The values in this hash point to other hashes (each value is a completely separate hash) that are all keyed by $month. It's an important point to understand.

I find that I can help myself remember this by using the -&gt; operator. This reminds me I'm talking about references and not merely other keys.

For example, instead of writing this:

It's not much, but it's a good reminder that $month are keys to a hash reference and I need to dereference that hash before I can see its values. 

Let's take a simple loop that prints out %hash:

for my $loginId ( sort keys %hash ) {

2130,2130,3393,Understanding the frequency scale of a spectrogram,"The graph below was derived from a raw seismogram recorded during an earthquake over a timespan from t=0 to t=1400 seconds (not shown on x-axis). 


The original seismogram $s(t)$ is not shown, but it is known that the original signal is the convolution between the source wave $w(t)$, the effects of the medium $g(t)$, and the effects from instrument itself $i(t)$; that is,  

$$s(t)=w(t)*g(t)*i(t)$$

The graph above is what remains after removing the instrument response as shown below:  



I think this instrument response is telling me that the amplitudes of the original seismogram $s(t)$ at frequencies higher than $0.02Hz$ were amplified at a constant gain of approximately $1E9$, while amplitudes lower than $0.01Hz$ are effectively dampened (by gains significantly smaller than at those frequencies higher than $0.02Hz$).

But what exactly can I effectively say about the shape of the original seismogram from this information?  If these frequencies are 'dampened' in the broadband representation above, what, if anything, can be said about the amplitudes and shapes observed in the original graph?  Can I simply say that longer waves should be present in the original signal but not say anything about when they occur?  Could I somehow convolve these graphs to generate the original signal (or at least closely approximate it)?

Given that you know the (at least approximate) magnitude response of the instrument, you would like to best estimate what the actual signal at the instrument's input looked like.

This is similar to the process of equalization used in communications systems. Since you have some knowledge of the system (in this case characterized by the impulse response $i(t)$ or the frequency response plot that you showed), you can attempt to undo the effects on the signal that are imposed by the measurement instrument. More generally, this type of operation is known as deconvolution: given an output of a convolution and optionally knowledge of one of the inputs to the convolution, one would like to calculate the other input. In this case, one of the convolution inputs is $i(t)$ and the output is the measurements reported by your instrument. 

It appears that you don't know the exact impulse response of the measurement device, only its magnitude response. This isn't enough information in itself to execute the deconvolution, so you'll need to make some assumptions about the phase response of the instrument in order to move forward with that approach. This is a very powerful technique, however; as the Wikipedia article notes, the approach can be used to compensate for the effects of the seismic propagation medium also (since it's also modeled as a convolution with an impulse response), potentially allowing you to gain more insight as to the original seismic event.

Edit: And, as to your questions about how you're interpreting the plot, your understanding seems correct. The system has a highpass characteristic with a flat passband starting at approximately $0.02\ \text{Hz}$, with the magnitude response decreasing by a factor of 10 per decade of frequency below $0.02\ \text{Hz}$. This could be modeled well as a single-pole highpass filter.

The original seismogram $s(t)$ is not shown, but it is known that the original signal is the convolution between the source wave $w(t)$, the effects of the medium $g(t)$, and the effects from instrument itself $i(t)$; that is,  

$$s(t)=w(t)*g(t)*i(t)$$

The graph above is what remains after removing the instrument response as shown below:  



I think this instrument response is telling me that the amplitudes of the original seismogram $s(t)$ at frequencies higher than $0.02Hz$ were amplified at a constant gain of approximately $1E9$, while amplitudes lower than $0.01Hz$ are effectively dampened (by gains significantly smaller than at those frequencies higher than $0.02Hz$).

But what exactly can I effectively say about the shape of the original seismogram from this information?  If these frequencies are 'dampened' in the broadband representation above, what, if anything, can be said about the amplitudes and shapes observed in the original graph?  Can I simply say that longer waves should be present in the original signal but not say anything about when they occur?  Could I somehow convolve these graphs to generate the original signal (or at least closely approximate it)?

For example:

If I stand under a sodium-vapour (orange) streetlight and calibrate my camera's white balance, what effect would this have if I were to take a photo of a colour test chart?  Presumably, white would still render as white due to the white balance calibration, but how would other colours be rendered?

",gjb,https://photo.stackexchange.com/users/3775,"The issue with these sorts of light sources isn't the color temperature, but rather the spectrum provided by the light.

A camera (or your eyes) can only record colors which are reflected from the objects in the scene (not counting objects which have fluorescent properties). If the light shining on the object doesn't contain a certain color, it can't bounce to you, and therefore the color of the object can't be recorded in the way it might be under full spectrum light.

In your specific example of a sodium-vapor light, the color spectrum looks like this:

You can see that there's a very narrow spike of light just short of 600nm, which is quite yellow. Everything you see (or photograph) will be in terms of how the object reflects light in that narrow band. So your assumption is correct — you can shift what is recorded as neutral grey/white, but your chart will probably look quite strange and ""inaccurate"". And there's really nothing you can do about it besides bringing in other lighting.

If your other lighting is also narrow-spectrum, that will improve rendition of the colors it adds — pretty simple, except when it comes to getting everything in your scene lit the way you'd like it to be with each different color. And your white balance will need to be more of a compromise (probably you'd pick something which would preserve both strong color casts, rather than attempting to neutralize them).

From a usability perspective.  12.10 seems smoother and a little sharper.  It's video is more polished.  On my 64bit 3.0ghz 8gb ram Dell 780 desktop it's beautifully smooth.

You can install gnome desktop on any of the Ubuntu flavours, but a direct download and install is more convenient and a little tighter integrated. KUbuntu(kde), XUbuntu(Xfce) LUbuntu(Lxde).

Can I  suggest you download a few and make some bootable cd's, give 'em a whirl and see what you think?  If your still unsure you can install different desktop environments through out the different Ubuntu flavours.

I've warmed to Unity, but as it turns out with customisations all over the place, it now looks and behaves more like a mac (after spending 20 years on windows), go figure! :)

Always remember,  Linux can't be judged as an ""operating system"" in the same vane windows is. It's actually a usability experience.  You can do what ever your imagination can conjure, including customising the environment you work to an unrecognisable point.

It's easy to consider the new manifestation simply as a mental/emotinal/[physical] clone that has just started living.

It is something I leave intentionally vague so that players can explore the concept and come up with their own conclusions. 

Now, psionics is interesting.  You could rule that it is a concept of the body and not the ghost. So, were you infected you could cure yourself by moving body.  Or you could rule that it is a corruption of the ghost so that any new body will exhibit it as well.  Or it could be both depending on exactly which strain a character gets inflected with.

So far so good.

Here's the catch: because we're involved in handling quite a lot of personal information, we have to be quite careful about who can and can't access it; specifically, only ""Trusted"" applications should be able to do so. So the natural way to do this is to use a custom permission within the AndroidManifest.xml file where we declare the services. My problem is this: I want to be able to enact signature-level protection (similar to the normal ""signature"" permission level), but with a bit of a catch:

With regards to the code provided, how many shutdowns are required if I execute a hundred Runnables with the fixed thread pool set to one?   I think the code should execute a hundred futures sequentially in the for loop execution order with a single thread (never spawns more than a single thread), and requires a single ExecutorService shutdown.  Is this correct?  Also, it's ok to call shutdown right after the for loop completes because all hundred of the futures are in queue so that the executorService shutdown will occur automatically after all hundred futures complete.

",SSumner,https://judaism.stackexchange.com/users/2616,"OK.

The reason is that according to halacha a hymen will regrow if ruptured before the age of three.1  For this reason, it is considered as if no sexual act has occurred as far as the girl's halachic status is concerned, to the extent that her status as a virgin has not changed. Hence, she (for example)  is entitled to a minimum kesuba of 200 zuz, just as any other virgin is.2

Navigateto(),"I am just getting started with karma, and although it seems that everything is hooked up properly and my unit tests are being run as expected, I can't get my end to end tests to find any elements. 

When I go to the debug page, I can see a very brief flash of my application, which says to me that my proxy and config in general is hooked up properly, but when I run

describe('my app', function() {
  beforeEach(function(){
     browser().navigateTo('/');
  });
  it('should display the home page', function() {
     expect(element('title').text()).toEqual('my title');
  });

it never finds an element, no matter the selector I put in.

My question, though, is... is there some way that I can see what it is seeing? Can I get karma to dump the full text of the html response? If I could do that, I could at least see what it is getting back. As it stands, I am getting no debugging information at all and it is kind of frustrating.

Feel free to ask for more information if I can make it easier to answer the question. Thank you for any help you can provide.

My thinking is that a ski helmet would:


Help to keep your ears warm
Would fit well with ski goggles (which fit poorly with my bike helmet)
Not have air vents in it which make you cold in the winter

",sixtyfootersdude,https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/users/134,"If you're thinking about wearing a ski helmet for biking, for what it's worth the Snell RS-98 recreational skiing and B-95 biking helmet standards are nearly identical, word for word, including things like visibility requirements and anatomical coverage. There are some small differences in the drop test. The energy of the flat anvil drop test in the B-95 standard is 110J vs. 100J for the RS-98 ski standard.  The hemispherical anvil drop test is 80 J for RS-98 and 72 for B-95. Bike helmets are tested against the point of a right angle ""kerbstone"" anvil, but ski helmets are tested against an ""edge anvil"" 6.3mm wide -- basically a decapitating machine -- and at higher forces than the kerbstone test too. Both bike and ski helmets have to be tested after being chilled and soaked, but bike helmets have to be tested after being cooked at 50 C (122 F).

The reasonable conclusion is that a Snell certified ski helmet is probably a suitable choice for winter biking, but should not be used after exposure to extreme heat.  Yes, a certified ski helmet might pass the 100J flat anvil test but not the 110 J test, but it probably does.

As for ASTM 2040, who can say? It's not available for free inspection. But it appears that the requirements for recreational ski helmets and bike helmets are pretty close.

4186,4186,6677,Knots that unknot in a manifold,"Take a closed $n$-manifold $M$ and fix a nice $n$-ball $B$ in $M$. How much information about $M$ does the set of knotted $(n-2)$-spheres of $B$ which are unknotted in $M$ give?
",Mariano Suárez-Álvarez,https://mathoverflow.net/users/1409,"Ryan gives a very nice answer in dimension 3, leaving the higher-dimensional case of the question open.  I can't discuss the question with as much authority as I would like, but I can start to piece together an answer.  My impression is that in any dimension $n$, an $(n-2)$-knot $K$ that is unknotted in $M$ is already unknotted in $B$ in the continuous category.  In the smooth and PL categories, it should be the same except in $n=4$ dimensions, where the question runs into a lack of understanding of smooth (or equivalently PL) structures on 4-manifolds.

First, my impression from skimming some geometric group theory is that a finitely presented group cannot be an infinite free product.  Moreover, that it if it is a finite free product, the factors have unique isomorphism types.  If this impression is correct, then you can identify the knot group $\pi_1(S^n \setminus K)$ from the embedded fundamental group $\pi_1(M \setminus K)$.  In order to be trivial in $M$, the knot group of $K$ would have to be $\mathbb{Z}$.

Then, Aspherical manifolds and higher-dimensional knots, by Bruno Eckmann, begins:


  E. Dyer and R. Vasquez proved that the complement of a higher-dimensional
  knot $S^{n-2} \subset S^n$, $n \ge 4$, is never aspherical unless the knot group is infinite cyclic (and hence, for $n \ge 5$, the imbedding is unknotted). [Footnote referring to papers of Levine, Stallings, Wall, Shaneson.] In the present note we give a simple proof of this fact based on some remarks concerning compact $\partial$-manifolds.


My impression is that the surgery methods in dimension $n \ge 5$ used to prove the unknottedness assertion are valid in the smooth, PL, and continuous categories.  Dimension $n=3$ is of course a special case where you do not need to consider algebraic topology, but instead prove things with direct cut-and-paste arguments as Ryan describes.  In dimension $n=4$, the surgery theory is (a) much more difficult in the continuous category, and (b) non-existent in the smooth/PL category.

The paper The algebraic characterization of the exteriors of certain 2-knots, by Jonathan Hillman, credits Freedman with the result that a 2-knot with knot group $\mathbb{Z}$ is unknotted.  If this requires Freedman's work, then I would think that it is open in the smooth/PL case.  What would be open is whether the 4-manifold with boundary $B^3 \times S^1$ has more than one smooth structure.  If it does, I have seen a principle that smooth structures on a 4-manifold can merge together when you take a connected sum with manifolds such as $\pm \mathbb{C}P^2$ an $S^2 \times S^2$.  I do not know if this principle is established for manifolds with a fundamental group.

How much information does this set of knotted $(n-2) $- unbundled $B $sphere in $M $give about $M $?","Ryan gives a very nice answer in dimension 3, leaving the higher-dimensional case of the question open.  I can't discuss the question with as much authority as I would like, but I can start to piece together an answer.  My impression is that in any dimension $n$, an $(n-2)$-knot $K$ that is unknotted in $M$ is already unknotted in $B$ in the continuous category.  In the smooth and PL categories, it should be the same except in $n=4$ dimensions, where the question runs into a lack of understanding of smooth (or equivalently PL) structures on 4-manifolds.

First, my impression from skimming some geometric group theory is that a finitely presented group cannot be an infinite free product.  Moreover, that it if it is a finite free product, the factors have unique isomorphism types.  If this impression is correct, then you can identify the knot group $\pi_1(S^n \setminus K)$ from the embedded fundamental group $\pi_1(M \setminus K)$.  In order to be trivial in $M$, the knot group of $K$ would have to be $\mathbb{Z}$.

Then, Aspherical manifolds and higher-dimensional knots, by Bruno Eckmann, begins:


  E. Dyer and R. Vasquez proved that the complement of a higher-dimensional
  knot $S^{n-2} \subset S^n$, $n \ge 4$, is never aspherical unless the knot group is infinite cyclic (and hence, for $n \ge 5$, the imbedding is unknotted). [Footnote referring to papers of Levine, Stallings, Wall, Shaneson.] In the present note we give a simple proof of this fact based on some remarks concerning compact $\partial$-manifolds.


My impression is that the surgery methods in dimension $n \ge 5$ used to prove the unknottedness assertion are valid in the smooth, PL, and continuous categories.  Dimension $n=3$ is of course a special case where you do not need to consider algebraic topology, but instead prove things with direct cut-and-paste arguments as Ryan describes.  In dimension $n=4$, the surgery theory is (a) much more difficult in the continuous category, and (b) non-existent in the smooth/PL category.

The paper The algebraic characterization of the exteriors of certain 2-knots, by Jonathan Hillman, credits Freedman with the result that a 2-knot with knot group $\mathbb{Z}$ is unknotted.  If this requires Freedman's work, then I would think that it is open in the smooth/PL case.  What would be open is whether the 4-manifold with boundary $B^3 \times S^1$ has more than one smooth structure.  If it does, I have seen a principle that smooth structures on a 4-manifold can merge together when you take a connected sum with manifolds such as $\pm \mathbb{C}P^2$ an $S^2 \times S^2$.  I do not know if this principle is established for manifolds with a fundamental group.  But at the very least, I have heard that the semigroup of smooth structures on $S^4$ is completely unknown, and its action on the smooth structures on another 4-manifold is completely unknown.  So if the smooth Poincare conjecture is sufficiently false, presumably you could have a non-trivial 2-knot in $B$ that becomes trivial in $M$.

For years 2011 and 2012, I was under the impression that I am required neither to pay taxes nor to file a return in US.

Am I still supposed to file return and pay taxes in US (whatever remains after foreign tax credit for what I pay in India) as my income originates in US?

",Mandar,https://money.stackexchange.com/users/3774,"The fact that you got notice doesn't necessarily mean that you should have filed. What it means is that the IRS thought that you should file. They're expecting your tax return, and I suspect it is because you made a mistake.

There are several different mistakes that you could have made (the list below is not complete, just what came to my mind right now):


You filed 2010 return as a resident (form 1040) instead of non-resident (1040NR) that you should have. IRS expects you to continue filing as resident, or to notify them of termination of residency. But since you've been on a student (J/F) visa - you were not a resident to begin with.
You filed form W9 with your bank or your clients. Form W9 is for residents, so they report your income to the IRS as if you were a resident. Hence the IRS expectation of a tax return. What you should have filed with them was form W8-BEN or W8-ECI, to show your non-resident status.
You received interest on your BofA bank account and didn't report it to the IRS, while they did. This is a matching error. Even if you're not supposed to pay tax, you should file tax returns in these cases to avoid these notices. However, if that's the case, you should have also paid some tax (check the treaty).
Your client issued a W2 for you. If that happened - it could really mess you up in the US, so I hope its not the case.


I suggest you take it to a US-licensed tax preparer (EA or CPA) who can check what exactly that is that the IRS want from you, why, and how to resolve it.

1741,1741,2752,How can I tell if a downloaded ISO is complete?,"I just ran into a nasty problem with an ISO download from Microsoft.  I successfully burnt it to a rewritable DVD, and copied the contents to the local hard drive on another machine, but when I went to run them they were corrupt.  It turns out the download had been truncated.

Now, OK, sometimes that happens - but it surprised me that the truncated file (which was only slightly more than 60% of the actual ISO) burnt successfully and seemed to be presenting me with a sensible file system, to the extent that I could (apparently) successfully copy the files.

So, is there some way I could have tested the file to see if it was complete or not?  The MS web site did not provide any information about the expected size, so I'm looking for a generic solution: given an ISO file which may or may not be truncated, is there some way to tell?  Do commonly used CD/DVD (data) formats include any embedded information about how much data is supposed to be on the disk, or even better, some kind of CRC?

A solution that detects most truncated images will be accepted, it doesn't need to be perfect.  (I'd prefer something that doesn't give false positives, though.)

",Nasser,https://tex.stackexchange.com/users/14594,"As Werner has noticed, you have an overlarge page. TeX goes to the next page to set the oversized page, if the current page is not empty. That it, what happened here. The page is not empty, if package hyperref is loaded.

Package hyperref has to add anchors for the \section commands (otherwise the links would not have targets to jump to). It hooks into \refstepcounter for setting the anchor. Thus the example can be reduced to:

4786,4786,7599,What is the best way to show the user large amounts of data?,"I am working on an application with a team that has roughly 2 years of data. This data is shown through multiple visualization methods. Part of the application is a settings panel, which lets the user control various things about the application (How much data they see, color schemes, etc.)

In the settings panel, one of the options allows the user to view their data in table format (report style). Because there is about two years worth of data, it's been broken up in to Month and Year increments. If the user wants to export a particular month, they can export that data to a .csv which can then be opened in a third party program like Excel or Calc. This is what it currently looks like with the entire visualization screen:



Close up view:



Even with the data broken up, there is still a substantial amount in each table (probably about 150 rows). This means the user still has to scroll to view the data. My co-workers think this is the best option, however I want to take a different approach.

I personally think that everything in the settings should be something to change the way the data looks or to get some of the data to take somewhere else.

My solution would be to show the user some sample data (maybe 3-4 rows), then give them the option to export as the main function (as opposed to reading it in browser). I think this makes more sense since the user won't have the ability to sort, select, change, etc. like they would in Excel. Mine would look something like this:

And infinite chunks can create an infinite world.

Memory should never be infinite and only several chunks near the character shown in the screen can be loaded into memory. How can I handle logic based blocks like red stone signals when they are in chunks far away and so not loaded in memory?
",warmwine,https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/users/49890,"In Minecraft, circuits in unloaded chunks simply do not work. Especially with pistons and other ways of interacting with the environment, it could get expensive quickly to keep far-away circuits running in an infinite world.

I see three main possible choices for your game:


Keep all chunks loaded. This is just a big nope.
Keep nearby chunks loaded. For chunks too far away, save the state of the chunk. When coming close to the chunk, load the state again.

This means that the circuit will continue where it left off. Complex circuits won't break this way.
On the downside, the circuit won't run when the player is too far, though this is generally acceptable.

Store active components separately. For chunks too far away, unload the terrain data but keep circuitry active.

This will cause things such as sensors, timers, etc... working all the time.
Bigger resource hit. An infinite world means possibly infinite circuits constantly running.
This would only work if circuits cannot interact with the terrain, or if they can only interact with the terrain within proximity of the player.

4123,4123,6579,Information to include with a fine art print?,"I am just beginning to sell some of my images and would like to personalize them a little.  Many photographers sign and title their work on the white space just below the printed image. I am having metal prints made so there is no matting or white space, so I considered printing small (2""x3.5"") stickers to place on the back of the images. What information do you think should be included on that sticker? Pretty much everything I've found online talks about a certificate of authenticity and limited editions. I do not want limited editions but would like to sign and number my larger prints. Does anyone have experience with this? Do I need to print a separate certificate? At this juncture my sticker will have my logo, image title, artist name (me), place for my signature and date, ""edition #xx of an open edition"". Some sites mention including the date the photograph was taken; format (i.e. 24""x36"" photographic print on metal), though it seems redundant since it will be on the back of the print; same goes for description of artwork, as well as copyright as I am signing and dating it. I do plan on printing a second sticker with care instructions (i.e. hang indoors and out of direct sunlight etc.).  

Revision to clarify:
What information should be included? Do I need to put copyright information if I am signing it? Is it necessary to include the format of the print or the shot on date?  Should I also be providing a certificate of authenticity?

I guess it's zero. But I can't prove it strictly. Please help... It can be concluded that the measure of any suitable subspace of $\ mathbb R ^ n $is zero.,"If the line is
$$
\ell=\{(x,0): x\in\mathbb R\},
$$
then for every $\varepsilon&gt;0$, we have
$$
\ell\subset \bigcup_{k\in\mathbb Z}I_k^\varepsilon,
$$
where
$$
I_k^\varepsilon=[k,k+1]\times[2^{-|k|-2}\varepsilon,-2^{-|k|-2}\varepsilon].

But
$$
m_2(\ell)\le\sum_{k\in\mathbb Z} m_2(I_k)=\sum_{k\in\mathbb Z} 2^{-|k|-1}\varepsilon=\varepsilon.
$$
Thus $m_2(\ell)&lt;\varepsilon$, for every $\varepsilon&gt;0$, and hence $m_2(\ell)=0$.

Any other straight line in $\mathbb R^2$ is obtained by a rigid motion of $\ell$, and rigid motion does not change the Lebesgue measure of a set.

Indeed, every proper linear subspace (or more generally, every proper hyperplane) 
of $\mathbb R^n$ has zero $n-$dimensional Lebesgue measure.

3757,3757,5984,What is temptation?,"Temptation, in the common secular sense, seems to indicate an attraction to something.


  Temptation
  
  
  The act of tempting
  The condition of being tempted.
  Something attractive, tempting or seductive; an inducement or enticement.
  Pressure applied to your thinking designed to create wrong emotions which will eventually lead to wrong actions.
  
  
  Tempting
  
  
  attractive, appealing, enticing
  seductive, alluring, inviting
  
  
  Tempt
  
  
  (transitive) To provoke someone to do wrong, especially by promising a reward; to entice. She tempted me to eat the apple.
  (transitive) To attract; to allure. Its glossy skin tempted me.
  (transitive) To provoke something; to court. It would be tempting fate.
  


But, as with many secular concepts that overlap religious concepts, there are often explicit theological definitions which allow the terminology to fit into religious, dogmatic, and theological discussions with less ambiguity. In this case, is there any predominating Christian/theological definition?

In particular, how is temptation defined or explained in such a manner that allows Christ to have been tempted?

To clarify the problem, if Christ is to be attracted to some thing, there must be some part or aspect of Christ to which some thing appeals. More significantly, Christ, in order to be tempted, must desire that thing if we are to say He is attracted to it. And if Christ is to contain a part or aspect to which some evil may be a temptation, thus arousing a desire, there could be said to be a sinful nature or component in Christ -- a contradiction of His Godliness.

To illustrate the problem, one might select magnetism (or any natural force) as a natural analogy. For the effect of magnetism (sin) to attract (tempt) a material (person), the material must contain, at least to some extent, a magnetic (sinful) component.

Thus, if we say that Christ is tempted in this understanding, we say that He has a sinful component.

How do we Christians, Catholics, or any denomination that has a well-established concept, define or explain temptation in a non-trivial manner without requiring Christ to have a sinful nature?
",svidgen,https://christianity.stackexchange.com/users/3410,"The following is sort of an answer to your question: the desert fathers (from the beginnings of monasticism) thought a lot about the beginning of sin. 

Sin has its origins in ""logismoi,"" thoughts in our mind floating hither and thither, often from whence we know not. ""Logismoi"" is usually translated as ""thoughts,"" though maybe in this usage it would be more suggestive to translate it as ""distractions"". Having logismoi is like walking the streets of Las Vegas, where promoters snap packets of prostitution flyers loudly across their hands and extend the flyers toward pedestrians. It is no sin to be assaulted by such advertising.

One may (at one's own risk) enter into dialogue with the logismoi to see what holds them together and to see how to help your brother (and yourself) tear them apart when need be.

Sin begins when one ""couples"" with logismoi, a condition described in depressing detail in our record of the ancestral sin:


  ... the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise....
  (Genesis 3:6)


One might say sin begins when one seriously considers a wrong choice as an option. Our Lord spoke of this in His sermon on the mount:


  You have heard that it was said, ""You shall not commit adultery."" But I say to you that every one who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart.
  (Matthew 5:27-28)


I say this is sort of an answer because it doesn't address the use of the word ""temptation"" in English as such. But I hope it helps illuminate how sin begins. 

In particular, Christ was, presumably, assaulted by logismoi as much as, and probably worse than, anyone else in human history. But He never coupled with them, so He never sinned. E.g. when tempted in the desert, Christ made it clear with His curt replies to Satan how little He thought of Satan's advances. 

More terrifying to consider along these lines was His struggle in Gethsemane. Perhaps it's best for me not to speculate on what was going through His mind then.

568,568,892,How do I find wiper refills for my 2008 Nissan Frontier?,"I never had any trouble finding wiper blade refills for my 1998 Honda Accord or 2000 Toyota Echo.  They were inexpensive because all you bought was the rubber part of the blade.  The steel strips to reinforce them were retained from the original wipers.

When my 2008 Nissan Frontier passenger wiper blade edge separated from the rest of the wiper I started looking for a replacement.  Refills I found claiming to be for my Frontier were usually refills for an after-market replacement arm assembly and did not fit my stock wipers.  I did finally find a Trico refill for my passenger side (18-240, narrow profile) but their recommended driver's side refill (24-240) is the same profile but needs to be wider (9mm vs 7mm??)

Local auto parts stores all say they stopped carrying OEM refills.  I could get a new wiper arm but years ago when I did that I regretted the poor quality of the replacement and the way it never quite fit the window as well.

They were inexpensive because all you bought was the rubber part of the blade.  The steel strips to reinforce them were retained from the original wipers.

When my 2008 Nissan Frontier passenger wiper blade edge separated from the rest of the wiper I started looking for a replacement.  Refills I found claiming to be for my Frontier were usually refills for an after-market replacement arm assembly and did not fit my stock wipers.  I did finally find a Trico refill for my passenger side (18-240, narrow profile) but their recommended driver's side refill (24-240) is the same profile but needs to be wider (9mm vs 7mm??)

Local auto parts stores all say they stopped carrying OEM refills.  I could get a new wiper arm but years ago when I did that I regretted the poor quality of the replacement and the way it never quite fit the window as well.
","I ran into the same problem recently.  It does appear that all the autoparts places have stopped carrying inserts.  They'd rather sell you a $10-20 blade than a $1-2 insert it seems.  :-)  The good news is that my car dealer DOES still carry inserts, and they're only $1.20 a piece...

3619,3619,5780,Is there a way to limit the range of the range pattern in awk?,"I am trying to use the awk range pattern to find all SQL select statements in a group of files, inspired by this stackoverflow answer.

From the awk manual:


  The pattern1, pattern2 form of an expression is called a range pattern.  It matches all input records starting with a record that matches pattern1, and continuing until a record that matches  pattern2,  inclusive.


My initial attempt was 

awk '/select/,/from/' *


where * in this case just represents a large number of varied files.

This returned several false hits on HTML select tags, so I refined my command to

awk '/[^&lt;]select[^&gt;]/,/from/' *

However, I still get some false hits from occurrences of the word ""select"" in a comment, and those hits produce very many lines of noise each before they eventually hit a ""from"" or the end of the file.
What I would like is for the range pattern not to register a match if there are more than, say, 10 lines between the ""select"" and the ""from"".

2853,2853,4542,"iPhone dock connector problems, with and without accessories","I started to experience problems with my iPhone that seem to be related to the dock connector.

Upon plugging my iPhone into my (officially supported) car stereo, I started to get the message  ""This accessory is not supported by iPhone"" on the screen.  Didn't think much of it as I only use it for charging purposes, and that still worked so I ignored it.  Then I bought a small ANT+ dongle, which is a little accessory you plug into the dock connector to allow your phone to receive data from various health/fitness devices like heart rate monitor, and cycle sensors etc.  It produces the same error message every time I plug it in, and the apps that use the dongle will not recognise it.

The dongle does officially support my hardware and OS level. I've checked that it is not broken by plugging it into an iPhone 5, an iPad 3 and an iPod of some description, none of which showed the error.  The supported apps find the device on the iPad, the iPhone 5 does not have the apps installed but offers to do so as soon as I plug it in, so I know the dongle is working correctly.

In addition to the above, when nothing is plugged into the dock connector, it still occassionally thinks that something is, resulting in a muted phone.  When it's in this state I am not able to hear anything or change any volume settings (music playback or ringer volume) with the physical keys. Going into the Music app shows that it thinks it's outputting the music to the dock connector.

Why is this accessory not working on my iPhone, and how can I get it working?  What causes my iPhone to think that it's docked when it isn't?
",stuffe,https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/9495,"@stuffe came up with a couple of correct solutions based on traditional wisdom, but failed to realize the depth to which Apple will go to obfuscate problems from the user.  It appears that there is a software setpoint for current (or power since the voltage is supposed to be the fixed) below which this state is triggered.

The message: ""This accessory may not be supported"", is due to insufficient power.

I am sure there is/was an Apple engineer could tell you exactly what current threshold triggers it (probable reasoning is adverse affect on battery life), but that is really irrelevant. Here are some things that you can do to correct it.


Clean connections.  Crud on connectors act as an insulator, reducing
the amount of current flow.
If its a usb cable, plug it in to something with a higher current (amps/milliamps) or power (watts/milliwatts) rating.*
Turn off, power saving features that may reduce power to usb ports. (if it stops after X minutes this is probably the reason)
Make sure your usb adapter outputs sufficient Volts (indicated by it only charging to XX% before you get the message)
Use a usb port closer to your laptop's the power supply (They often
handle more current than easier to access ones)
If you have one, you can try a powered usb hub (good ones are better
with high powered devices)
If none of that works, try a known working cable from a someone.
If that doesn't work you may have an issue with the connector in the
phone itself.


Usb power adapters should have the design voltage and current printed on them; however, this is the ""design"" rating.  Not all of them actually perform to spec in real life and it is not uncommon for components to weaken or fail over time, but still have some output.



Footnote:

I have an ASUS laptop running Linux and it has an easy to access usb port on the right  hand side near the front that doesn't output quite enough power.  Combined with a bit of connector corrosion, the only way it would charge was if I held it down fairly tightly on the charging base.  As soon as I would let go, I would get ""This accessory may not be supported"".  Simply switching it to the usb port near my power connector (in a less convenient location) was sufficient.  This tells me that it likely has nothing to do with any ""device"" specifics and since I have no iApps installed, those are ruled out too.  The only difference is the power output.  I will probably eventually need to clean my connections, but for now I'm good.

TODO: Write a polite letter to Apple requesting error messages that actually mean something.... It's probably in errno.h and strerror.h depending on how far they have gotten from their BSD roots (just add something like ELOWPWR and ""This accessory has insufficient power for charging."" respectively).

The problems with the techniques I used is that focus is manual and aperture control is problematic at best. This limited my setup to still subjects (read: dead insects) Now, as spring is approaching, I want to be able to shoot live insects. I believe that for this, autofocus and settable aperture will be of great help.

So, one obvious but expensive option is a macro lens (say, EF 100mm Macro) However, I am not really interested in yet another prime lens. An alternative is the electrical extension tubes.

",ihsoy ih,https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/27005,"Conceptually, I can see why you implemented the circuit this way:


If either of SW1 or SW2 is closed - either Q1 or Q2 will conduct and the current will flow to the LED
However, if both SW1 and SW2 are closed - both Q3 and Q4 will conduct which will cause Q5 to conduct. When Q5 is conducting, there is not enough voltage on LED to turn it on


Good thinking, really.

However, BJTs have high current gain (\$\beta\approx100\$). It means that even a low current to the base of Q5 will be amplified and the LED won't turn on. But how comes there is a current to the base of Q5 when SW1 is open? Isn't Q3 behaves as an open circuit when SW1 is open? The answer is NO - BJT transistors have very interesting behavior when operated with floating base. They are not, in general, behave like an open circuit.

What can you do? Well, in real applications you wouldn't design and use such a circuit. However, given that you are educating yourself (and me too), I'd suggest you try to apply the following changes:


Why did you choose 9V power supply? Each BJT has a maximum rating for \$V_{CE}\$ - check the model file that you're using and change your power supply accordingly. How this may help? Well, reducing \$V_{CE}\$ of Q3 may cause it to behave more like an open circuit when SW1 is open.
Try to add pull-down resistors between bases of Q3 and Q4 and the ground (these resistors must be pretty large). This approach will prevent the base of Q3 from being floating when SW1 is open (respectively for Q4 and SW2).
If none of the above worked, I suggest you'll try to find a way of ""stealing"" the current from the led which is not that sensitive to small unwanted currents as a single transistor. You may try to replace Q5 with Q3 and Q4 directly (collector of Q3 is connected in place of Q5's collector, emitter of Q4 is connected to ground).

Is the cat converter from the Beetle compatible with my car? If it is, would it be worth the effort of trying so salvage it from the Beetle, assuming it isn't damaged, and what would be a fair price to offer?
",biggvsdiccvs,https://mechanics.stackexchange.com/users/9402,"Looking it up on RockAuto.com, it shows for the 2.0l SOHC engine (they do not list an option for a 2.0L DOHC in the Beetle), the catalytic convertor which is offered there is a direct fit for 2001-2005 Beetle and for the 2002-2006 Jetta (as well as the 2001-2005 Golf and some even have it for a Mercedes model ... argh). This would seem to me to mean the cat in the Beetle should fit over to your Jetta without the need for modification. I think there is a flex pipe at the head (where the cat pipe connects to the turbo), so any small variance should not be an issue.

As far as cost of a new one, examples from rockauto are in the $250 range. Just throwing that out there.

It also allows for personnel to move around without tasking an entire starship to accompany them, such as when crew members have a transfer or family emergency. They have limited warp and are mainly intended to stay close to their mothership. Think of them as the lighters that old style sailing vessels had. Good for short trips or just two for a long one. They are also barely armed, often with just a phaser array and no photon torpedoes.

Runabouts, on the other hand, are designed to be much more hardy. They can sustain Warp 5, pack a couple of phaser arrays and occasionally stock a couple of torpedoes. They are intended to operate on their own for extended missions and are employed mainly on spacestations. They can hold quite a number of people on short or extended trips.

",cody,https://photo.stackexchange.com/users/11005,"A digital image sensor is ultimately a device that uses the photovoltaic or photoconductive properties of photodiodes to convert photons into electrons (charge), which can later be read out as a saturation value and converted to a digital pixel. This is an analog-to-analog then analog-to-digital conversion process. 

The key behavior of a photodiode relevant to imaging, converting photons to electrons, improves with total surface area. The more surface area, the greater the area to detect photon strikes per photodiode, and the greater the physical material area within which electron charge (signal) can be collected. In other words, larger physical pixel area equates to higher signal ratio. The ""depth"" of a well is ultimately immaterial to modern Bayer-type CFA sensors, as deeper penetration only really has a filtration effect...the deeper a photon penetrates a photodiode, the more blueshifted light will be filtered out in favor of redshifted light. This is due to the response curve of the type of silicon used in photodiodes...which are more sensitive to infrared wavelengths than visible light wavelengths, and more sensitive to visible light wavelengths than ultraviolet and x-ray wavelengths.

Finally, being electronic devices, image sensors produce a variety of forms of electronic noise. In particular, they are susceptible to a low number of electrons in any given photodiode being generated from the low level of dark current that is always running through the sensor. Being devices sensitive to electromagnetic frequencies, the intrinsic field of the sensor itself can be affected by strong, nearby devices that emit electromagnetic frequencies of their own (if its not shielded properly) which can produce banding. Slight differences in the exact electrical response of each pixel can produce slight variations in how the charge accumulated in a photodiode is read out, and there can be thermally induced forms of noise. These forms of noise create a signal floor wherein it becomes difficult or impossible to determine of a digital pixel level is the product of an actual photon capture or due to electronic and thermal noise. So long as the image signal is larger than the noise floor, or in other words the signal to noise ratio (SNR) is high, a useful image can be produced.

All things being equal...and by that, I mean the same number of pixels, the same ultimate sensor design characteristics, the same amount of dark current, the same amount of read noise...a smaller sensor will be noisier than a larger sensor because the larger sensor, with the exact same number of pixels, can have larger surface area for each of those pixels, allowing more electrons to be captured for any given photon strike. A larger pixel has a higher maximum saturation point, which allows more total electron charge before the pixel is ""full"" or totally white. That intrinsically increases SNR, reducing the impact that electronic noise has on the final image signal, producing less noisy images at exactly the same settings as a smaller sensor.

Dynamic range is the total usable tonal range available from a sensor. It is ultimately affected by the amount of electronic noise present in a sensor and the maximum saturation point of the pixels, or the ratio between the mean of electronic noise and the maximum saturation point of each pixel in the sensor. Again, all things being equal, dynamic range will be better on a larger sensor as the SNR, even at low signal levels, is going to be slightly better than a smaller sensor, and at higher signal levels it can be significantly better. As is often the case with image sensors these days, increasing pixel size, or for that matter increasing a pixels maximum sensitivity (ISO), has the effect of also increasing the maximum amount of read noise at low ISO. This is ultimately due to poor control over electronic noise to start with, resulting in higher read noise at minimum ISO for larger sensors than for smaller sensors. While the increase in read noise is often still minor compared to the increase in maximum saturation point, and therefor does not affect maximum SNR much, it can mitigate or eliminate any gains at the sensors minimal SNR level, reducing or eliminating any improvement in dynamic range as well.

5948,5948,9424,"iPhone dock connector problems, with and without accessories","I started to experience problems with my iPhone that seem to be related to the dock connector.

Upon plugging my iPhone into my (officially supported) car stereo, I started to get the message  ""This accessory is not supported by iPhone"" on the screen.  Didn't think much of it as I only use it for charging purposes, and that still worked so I ignored it.  Then I bought a small ANT+ dongle, which is a little accessory you plug into the dock connector to allow your phone to receive data from various health/fitness devices like heart rate monitor, and cycle sensors etc.  It produces the same error message every time I plug it in, and the apps that use the dongle will not recognise it.

The dongle does officially support my hardware and OS level. I've checked that it is not broken by plugging it into an iPhone 5, an iPad 3 and an iPod of some description, none of which showed the error.  The supported apps find the device on the iPad, the iPhone 5 does not have the apps installed but offers to do so as soon as I plug it in, so I know the dongle is working correctly.

In addition to the above, when nothing is plugged into the dock connector, it still occassionally thinks that something is, resulting in a muted phone.  When it's in this state I am not able to hear anything or change any volume settings (music playback or ringer volume) with the physical keys. Going into the Music app shows that it thinks it's outputting the music to the dock connector.

It seems like in the double slit we know if we observe the particle the wave function collapse and the electron acts like a normal particle, so doesn't that solve the problem in Schrödinger's Cat?

When we open the box the atom that should help release the poison acts like a particle,the poison is in the bottle so the cat stays alive, don't know really?!
","1) The central maximum of the diffraction pattern is between the slits.
2) Shoot single electrons at the double slit.  The same diffraction pattern accumulates.
3) Any attempt to identify through which slit a given electron passes collapses the double slit diffraction pattern into two single slit patterns.
4) All of it works just fine using C60 buckminsterfullerene as the diffracted entity, MW = 720.6 amu, or a big molecule like phthalocyanine derivatives C48H26F24N8O8 MW = 1298.7 amnu.

",Mariano Suárez-Álvarez,https://mathoverflow.net/users/1409,"Kevin Walker and a member of the forum (by e-mail) let me know about a flaw in the argument in my previous post.  I'll erase it after putting up this post. 

One of my claims was the if $K$ unknots in $M$ then it unknots in $B$, where $K$ is a knot in a ball $B \subset M$.  If $K$ is the unknot in $M$ it bounds a disk $D \subset M$, $K = \partial D$.  In dimension $3$ we perturb the disc so that $D \cap \partial B$ is a collection of circles, this allows us to cap off $D \cap B$ with disc(s) parallel to $\partial B$ (an embedded surgery construction), constructing a disc in $B$ that bounds $K$.  In higher dimensions this argument runs into trouble as it's not clear if you can perform the required embedded surgeries.  

I also claimed that the only new isotopy relation in general is that knots in $B$ can be isotopic (in $M$) to their mirror inverse if $M$ is non-orientable.  I still suspect this is the case and I think I have an idea for an argument but I should think about it some more before posting.  Here is an argument that works in dimension 3:

Say $M$ is a compact boundaryless $3$-manifold, $K$ and $K'$ contained in a ball $B$ are isotopic in $M$. Perform the connect-sum decomposition on $M \setminus K$ and $M \setminus K'$.  Since this is a unique decomposition (modulo issues in the non-orientable case), in both cases you get a list of prime factors that are identical except in the decomposition of $M \setminus K$ you get a summand that's $B \setminus K$ capped off with a disc, and in the other case you get a summand $B \setminus K'$ capped off with a disc. By the Gordon-Luecke theorem $K$ and $K'$ are either isotopic in $B$ or mirror images of each other. 

I'm still hopeful I have an argument that works in general.  I'll edit this post again tomorrow once I'm certain.

5446,5446,8644,Removing a Viscous Fan without the serpentine belt (1998 Land Rover Discovery),"The PAS pump on my Discovery failed fairly spectacularly last week, shedding it's pulley at the side of the road. In order to get at it to replace it, I need to get the fan off, which requires undoing a left-hand-thread nut in the viscous coupling. 

The problem, however, is that I can't stop the pulley rotating in order to undo it (it's on it's own pulley rather than being on the end of the crankshaft). Normally this would be held in place by the serpentine belt, but without the PAS pulley I can't refit the belt...

Any suggestions? I can't get anything in there to wedge the pulley...

Edit: It's the big bolt in the middle of this part (thanks Paulster2 for the link):


And it is located here on the car:


The big pulley spins freely. I've tried using the small bolts that hold the pulley on for extra purchase - two of the four came undone (great, I thought!), but the other two won't - because of the hexagonal shape of the big nut, I can't get a ring spanner on them, and an open-ended one just started to round them...
",Nick C,https://mechanics.stackexchange.com/users/373,"Using the new pump, you are able to determine the size of its large nut. It is either 34 or 36mm across the flats. Using a flat piece of metal, make a flat spanner with a length long enough to extend out of fan blades to fit the nut. With the 'spanner' on the nut and with a engineers hammer, strike the improvised spanner to undo the nut. The inertia of the assembly allows it to come undone. Viscous couple spanners to do exactly the same are available here in the UK for around £5 ($10 ?). Use a dab of Locktite when fitting the new pump, impacting it in the other direction to tighten it.
In a workshop with an air chisel, they can be undone by a couple of short bursts aimed at an angle to the nut.

","With the new pump, you can determine the size of its large nut. It's a 34 or 36 mm unit. Using a flat piece of metal, make a flat wrench long enough to extend out of the fan blade to fit the nut.

30,30,47,How do different tissue culture matrices affect background in fluorescent microscopy?,"In response to my previous question, I've been reading up a little bit on poly-D-lysine, Collagen I, Collagen IV, laminin, and other tissue culture coatings that promote cell adhesion. I've always assumed that anything other than standard TC-treated plastic or glass would significantly increase background, but perhaps my views on background fluorescence are a little outdated. Does anybody have experience with these in a fluorescent microscopy/high-throughput screening environment?

Specifically in my case, I'm looking at endocytosis and trafficking of a labeled protein into the lysosome. I'm labeling the protein with the pH-dependent dye pHrodoTM from Molecular Probes, which supposedly has very little fluorescence at neutral pH, but becomes very bright as the pH drops when endocytic vesicles become lysosomes. This theoretically means that a final wash step is not needed, but with a matrix coating on the plates I'm worried about background.

So, what is the current thinking as far as background fluorescence of the various TC matrices is concerned? Does the background come from the matrix itself, or by the fluorescent dye becoming adsorbed to it? Is it wavelength-dependent? Fortunately I may not be stuck with my poorly-adhering cells, and I may not need supplemental matrix at all in the end, but I still want a better understanding of how it works.

This would lead one to think that new PIs might be more likely to take on students they might not necessarily love, but just need bodies in the lab. However, on the other hand, new PIs are more likely to have limited funding, and if they are on the tenure-track, would need their few students to succeed in order to establish a name for themselves in the industry. In this case, it would be detrimental if they chose the wrong student(s) in the beginning, especially if they are limited to the number of students they can afford due to funding issues.

What you are describing is not really functionality, it's dysfunctionality caused by a misconception. It's not cron that sends the SIGPIPE, but it is because of the way you are using it.

By default cron emails the stdout and stderr of a process to the owner of the crontab using sendmail (see man cron; if you don't have an MTA installed, the output is just discarded), unless they are redirected.  To do this, it must wait for the process to complete.  However, if you have backgrounded the process with &amp;:

* * * * * /bin/someprogram &amp;


It won't wait, and if the program now tries to write to stdout or stderr, it will get a SIGPIPE, because the pipe is broken (the read end was closed). [This might also happen to a non-background process on older crons if your MTA is missing and you have a lot of output]

So I am going to guess that you have something like this in your crontab:

* * * * * /bin/someprogram &gt; log.file &amp;


Meaning the stdout is redirected to a file, but the stderr pipe is still broken.  This has led you to the erroneous conclusion that ""cron executes whatever program is sent to it in such a fashion that anything written to STDERR causes ... SIGPIPE"".

You can fix your crontab by either removing the backgrounding &amp; or redirecting stderr too:

* * * * * /bin/someprogram 1&gt;&amp;2&amp;&gt; log.file &amp;


If you want.  WRT duplicating this yourself, as qqx says, just close one end of a pipe and then write to it.

Before we talk about password reset - in this case a good system cannot remind you of your password as it is not recoverable! It can only reset it for you and again isn't this sent plaintext over the net ??? So why cant that get stolen..

The issue is when the real plain text passwords are known by anyone or any system other than the user then identity is lost.

",Ali,https://unix.stackexchange.com/users/3850,"I have been running Slackware releases for some years.  I made my development machine into an Arch box a couple of years ago. I think that Arch holds your hand a bit more than Slackware, in that pacman can detect missing packages, where installpkg doesn't.  To me, it also seemed easier to have a custom kernel on Slackware than on Arch: I gave up on custom kernels and just went with the Arch rolling release kernel.

I don't think Arch takes that much extra time, I would gladly have an Arch desktop (as long as I get to run pacman -Syu once a week), and I would gladly spend 100% of my time in Arch or Slackware.

According to the manual linked to by @Batman, it looks like you can enter a custom wheel size after you have clicked through all the predefined wheel sizes. Based on the fact that it's 4 digits, the custom wheel size is most likely in mm. 

Another way of calculating the circumference, is to take wheel diameter (total distance across, and multiply by pi (3.14).  If you don't have any measuring device and want something reasonably close, take the bead seat diameter, for 650B, this is 584mm, add in 2 times the tire size.

This needs to be setup, but im really not sure how i do this. The wheel size of the bike is a 27,5 inches. The bike computer is a Bontrager Trip 100, that comes with the following wheel settings:

700:23, 700:25, 700:28, 700:32, 700:35, 700:38, 29:2.1, 29:2.2, 26:1.5, 26:1.9, 26:2.0, 26:2.1, 26:2.2, 26:2.3

One thing is what setting to enter on the computer, but im also unsure about where i should place the sensor and receiver on the wheel. I believe it must matter if i place the sensor and receiver near the center of the wheel, or if i place it need the edge.   
","On this page, the following information is given.


  Use a roll out method ie measure circumference with a mark on the tyre
  and roll forward one exact revolution measure with a tape measure the
  distance covered preferably sat on bike, then put dimension into the
  custom setting for wheel size, youtube shows a good example.


According to the manual linked to by @Batman, it looks like you can enter a custom wheel size after you have clicked through all the predefined wheel sizes. Based on the fact that it's 4 digits, the custom wheel size is most likely in mm. 

Another way of calculating the circumference, is to take wheel diameter (total distance across, and multiply by pi (3.14).  If you don't have any measuring device and want something reasonably close, take the bead seat diameter, for 650B, this is 584mm, add in 2 times the tire size. Assuming you have 2 inch tires, that's 50.8 mm. So we end up with 584 + 2 * 50.8 = 685.6 mm diameter, and when multiplying by pi gives us a circumference of 2152.8 mm.

This is the clearest picture of what happens to us as we are baptized into Christ and become married to him. Because we died, we are free from our former spouse, the law,..
....because death dissolves marriages and frees the living spouse to marry again, as Jesus taught. The law our former spouse did not change, we changed, because we died 'in Christ' we became 'free from the law'.

An app downloaded from Google Play may not modify, replace or update its own APK binary code using any method other than Google Play's update mechanism.

This means developsers can't use self-modifying code??

For example, when users run a my app for the first time, my app modify its binary code. 

And if I use it, can I upload my app using self-modifying code??
","Although the policy doesn't allow, if Google doesn't detect us doing, we are safe.

There are couple of ways to dynamically load binary code AKA DEX file. So at runtime you download updated dex file and run it. It is pretty well-known. You can find some info here http://android-developers.blogspot.sg/2011/07/custom-class-loading-in-dalvik.html

1919,1919,3056,What is temptation?,"Temptation, in the common secular sense, seems to indicate an attraction to something.


  Temptation
  
  
  The act of tempting
  The condition of being tempted.
  Something attractive, tempting or seductive; an inducement or enticement.
  Pressure applied to your thinking designed to create wrong emotions which will eventually lead to wrong actions.
  
  
  Tempting
  
  
  attractive, appealing, enticing
  seductive, alluring, inviting
  
  
  Tempt
  
  
  (transitive) To provoke someone to do wrong, especially by promising a reward; to entice. She tempted me to eat the apple.
  (transitive) To attract; to allure. Its glossy skin tempted me.
  (transitive) To provoke something; to court. It would be tempting fate.
  


But, as with many secular concepts that overlap religious concepts, there are often explicit theological definitions which allow the terminology to fit into religious, dogmatic, and theological discussions with less ambiguity. In this case, is there any predominating Christian/theological definition?

In particular, how is temptation defined or explained in such a manner that allows Christ to have been tempted?

To clarify the problem, if Christ is to be attracted to some thing, there must be some part or aspect of Christ to which some thing appeals. More significantly, Christ, in order to be tempted, must desire that thing if we are to say He is attracted to it. And if Christ is to contain a part or aspect to which some evil may be a temptation, thus arousing a desire, there could be said to be a sinful nature or component in Christ -- a contradiction of His Godliness.

To illustrate the problem, one might select magnetism (or any natural force) as a natural analogy. For the effect of magnetism (sin) to attract (tempt) a material (person), the material must contain, at least to some extent, a magnetic (sinful) component.

Thus, if we say that Christ is tempted in this understanding, we say that He has a sinful component.

How do we Christians, Catholics, or any denomination that has a well-established concept, define or explain temptation in a non-trivial manner without requiring Christ to have a sinful nature?

Ask yourself: who is the target audience of an academic paper? 

It is not end-users. It is reviewers! 
Do reviewers want code? Depends on the situation. Sometimes they do. Often they don't.

Think about this: why mathematicians don't provide formal proofs but use informal arguments? 

It is costs vs. benefits. Providing a formally verified proof is possible but usually needs too much work, work that authors are not trained for and don't have much experience with. On the other hand, what do authors gain from it? Does it help convince the reviewers about the correctness of the results? No, usually reviewers prefer short informal explanation that allows them to understand and see why the result is true. A formal proof usually will not help much. There are people who don't like computer-assisted proofs which cannot be verified and understood directly by humans.

The same costs vs. benefits thinking applies to programs. If providing code will not help convince the reviewer about the correctness of the paper, then why waste resources (time/money/pages/...) to do so? Do reviewers have time to read codes with thousands of lines to check there is no bug in them? 

On the other hand, sometimes the software resulting from the paper is of primary interest. Having the code is helpful in verifying the claims. E.g. you claim you have a faster algorithm for SAT. Then it is helpful to provide the code. In such cases authors provide their code. This is mainly in more experimental parts. We don't care about the correctness of the code but obtaining results better than existing algorithms. In such situations there are typically standard benchmarks to compare algorithms. (See for example SAT competitions.) If there aren't established benchmarks then why publish code? If it is a theoretical result where the asymptotic benefits take place over instances which are too large to test what is the benefit of have the code?

5458,5458,8665,Is it possible to build a CPU from content-addressable memory?,"Every modern programming language use objects and not C/C++ style struct/class.
In C/C++ every data member has a size, so addressing a struct member is basically a memory address + offset. But script languages just like JavaScript and many others use an object ID that contains key/value pairs. These key/value pairs can be also an object ID.

So nowadays hardware memory is addressed with memory address + offset or memory address to a lookup table where key/value are stored.

A memory address can contains data or ASM code that is executable by a CPU.

So is it possible to build a hardware that only contains content-addressable memory (CAM)?

  -key: 456, value: 8
  -key: 789, value: 0


This is a scheme of a content addressable memory block. This block can be write with a SetValue(id, key, value) opcode and can read with a GetValue(id, key)

I would think that for feeding a current into a resistor this will be OK but don't expect miracle performance, for instance if set to 20mA any resistance higher than 1500 ohm will cause the output voltage to want to go greater than 30V and of course this cannot happen. Also, if you have voltage limit set to 15V, then don't expect the current limit to stay limiting/controlling when the external resistance is above 750 ohms.

EDIT If you are not satisfied with the performance of the power supply and you wanted to try a different method consider this technique: -



With R1 at 312.5 ohms, output current should be 4 mA plus a little bit from the adjust pin (maybe 50 uA). For 20 mA, R1 needs to be 62.5 ohms

","try this one.It doesnt query the actual table but will provide you the count of rows.This is better way if you have large tables and you need approximate count.

2287,2287,3644,"New to circuits, confused about where reset happens with SR flip-flop","In one of my classes we are learning about circuits. For homework, we have to create a finite state machine for a vending machine using an SR flip-flop. The machine can either take a nickel, dime, or nothing until it gets to at least 15 cents, so it has 4 states (0, 5, 10, and 15 cents). Once the machine receives 15 cents, it dispenses its product. Once in this state, if nothing is deposited it goes to the 0 state; if a nickel is deposited it goes to the 5 cent state; if a dime is deposited, it does to the 10 cent state.

Based on this truth table [and the k-maps I made from it], I created the following logic gates:


My question is, where exactly does the ""reset"" happen? For example, if I am in the 15 cent state and deposit a nickel, how does it go to the 5 cent stage? Do I have to make the output from ""open"" loop around? Sorry for such a novice question, I hope that made sense!

Edit: The first two columns are for the present state of the machine, i.e., how much you have deposited so far. So Q0 Q1 = 00 represents the first state (0 cents), Q0 Q1 = 01 represents the second state (5 cents), etc. The next two columns represent adding a nickel or dime. If you are in the state 00 and and 01, you should move to state 01. Since you cannot deposit a nickel and dime simultaneously, we don't care about the the input 11. If you are in state 10 and add 10, you go to state 11 (and don't get any change back!).
",A D,https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/8855,"The reset, given the truth table you provided, happens just because the state 11 of the state machine is mapped in the state 00; in fact, if you look at the outputs, both states have the same next state, so if the inputs are 00 (buffer), from the state 11 it will go to 00.

An optimization of the machine would use the Mealy topology, where you map the state 11 in 00 just changing the output if coming from an activating sequence.

You can udnerstand it better using the diagrams:

1363,1363,2145,Why does my bike make a noise when I pedal hard?,"When I pedal forcing a little with my right leg, the bike makes a noise that I don't know how to describe. I'll try to do it. It's like:


a short ""ting""
a tiny bell
if a small rock hits the down tube


I don't know what is causing this noise, but I think that it could be any of this things:


pedal
crank arm/pedal connection
crankset


I think the material of all these things is alluminium.

I don't feel anything (like a bad shifted chain) when I hear the noise.

It happens when there is movement and when there is NO movement (I use the brake, so the bike doesn'e move, stand using all weight on right pedal, and it makes the noise)

The pedals could be in any position, It is not in a particular position. Just pressing the right pedal.

Has someone else has this ""problem""? Any ideas of where this comes from?

Update:
Yesterday I took out the chain and stood on the right pedal, and made the noise. Then is not the chain, nor the transmission system.

I put oil in the pedal axis, but had no luck. Also tried to loose the pedal, but the juncture point is too tight, and I couldn't.

Today I will try to use oil in the bottom bracket.

3029,3029,4828,What is the probability that Brian makes money on his first roll,"
  Brian plays a game in which two fair, six-sided dice are rolled
  simultaneously. For each die, an even number means that he wins that
  amount of money and an odd number means that he loses that amount of
  money. What is the probability that Brian makes money on his first
  roll?


To find the probability, do we need to find the even numbers only. There are 36 outcomes from the two dies. So is there an easy  way to get the arrangements? 
",Complex Guy,https://math.stackexchange.com/users/52950,"Let the values of the dice in a roll be $a$ and $b$. You win money if ($1$) $a$ and $b$ are both even, ($2$) $a$ is even and $b$ is odd with $a&gt;b$, or ($3$) $a$ is odd and $b$ is even with $a&lt;b$.
For ($1$) there are $3$ even numbers in $1,2,\dots,6$, so there are $3^2=9$ ways for $a$ and $b$ to both be positive.
For ($2$) consider the three cases cases: $a=2 \implies b=1$; $a=4\implies b=1,3$; and $a=6\implies b=1,3,5$. Therefore, there are $6$ ways to get condition ($2$).

2784,2784,4435,Are there any differences in how new vs. well-established professors select students?,"For any professors out there, do you feel that there are any differences in how you selected and recruited students from the time when you were newly hired, to a well-established stage (i.e. after getting tenure)?

I would assume there are since the challenges and priorities for the two groups are normally somewhat different, but I'm not sure exactly how it would differ. For instance, it might be more difficult for the new PI to recruit students (especially good ones) when they have to ""compete"" with older, better funded peers. This would lead one to think that new PIs might be more likely to take on students they might not necessarily love, but just need bodies in the lab. However, on the other hand, new PIs are more likely to have limited funding, and if they are on the tenure-track, would need their few students to succeed in order to establish a name for themselves in the industry. In this case, it would be detrimental if they chose the wrong student(s) in the beginning, especially if they are limited to the number of students they can afford due to funding issues.

Is Nynäshamn a better port? Is it much cheaper to dock there than in the capital city? Or is it an important tourist attraction in its own right that should be given equal attention with Stockholm?
",Tom Au,https://travel.stackexchange.com/users/788,"In fact, Nynäshamn certainly is not the ""de facto"" port of Stockholm, even for international cruise liners.

Quote from the Ports of Stockholm authority web site:


  The Ports of Stockholm comprise a number of port areas, of which

  Skeppsbron are the most prominent commercially.  [...]
  
  Värtahamnen, Frihamnen and Stadsgården have extensive ferry services

  sixty kilometres south of Stockholm. Boats transporting both freight
  and passengers depart from Nynäshamn.

  In Nynäshamn we can also receive the larger international cruise
  liners that are not able to, or do not want to, voyage through the
  archipelago into Stockholm. In 2010 for example, a number of vessels

I think most of them would be able to, because many of the daily ferries to Finland or Baltic countries (such as M/S Viking Cinderella pictured below) are very large vessels too, and they have no problems navigating through the archipelago into the more central ports of Stockholm.

Edit: Well, looking at the map, it's actually quite clear why some briefly visiting cruise ships—arriving from the south—would rather stop at Nynäshamn. They'd have to take a long, time-consuming detour to reach the ports closer to Stockholm (see the maritime routes marked on the map, which approach Stockholm from northeast).

In essence, the analogy stated that God is like fire. Different objects, when dropped into the fire, react differently. Some become hard. Some become soft. Some let off smoke. Some change their hue. Some make a noise. Some might explode. But while all of these different reactions can be found, at no stage is the fire anything other than a fire; the difference in responses to it is to be found in the different objects that come into contact with it.

So too, the analogy concluded, when it comes to our relationship with God. When we pray, we change ourselves in order that God might interact more favourably with us. We do not hope for God to change in any way, but for ourselves to change instead. God's influence upon the world is constant and unchanging; it is we who are in flux.

Does this analogy sound familiar to anybody? If you can direct me to a printed source (be it in the writings of the Rav, or Prof. Leibowitz, or whomever it was who came up with this), I would be much obliged.

I wanted to take advantage of the fact the lists were sorted, but I fear my efforts only served to render my code convoluted and inefficient. What do you think?
",Legato,https://codereview.stackexchange.com/users/49181,"This is a fine implementation. 
It's well-formatted and nicely written.
I find the idea of using a LinkedHashSet quite clever and interesting.
There are a couple of points to improve though.

You have a bug

Do you notice something fishy here?


while (foo[i] &gt; bar[j] &amp;&amp; j &lt; bar.length) {
    j++;
}
if (foo[i] &lt; bar[j]) {



The condition in the while checks foo[i] &gt; bar[j] before j &lt; bar.length.
So when j reaches bar.length,
this will throw an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.

Flipping the &amp;&amp; may seem like an obvious remedy.
But it won't be enough,
because of the next if statement after the while loop,
you'll again have the problem if j has already reached bar.length.

An example input to demonstrate this issue: 33;3,4

Unit testing

It's always handy to have some unit tests around when solving challenges like this.
For example:

@Test
public void test_9_10_11_x_33_34_35() {
    assertEquals("""", findIntersection(""9,10,11;33,34,35""));
}

@Test
public void test_3_7_8_22_x_11_22() {
    assertEquals(""22"", findIntersection(""3,7,8,22;11,22""));
}

@Test
public void test_11_12_13_14_x_14_15_16() {
    assertEquals(""14"", findIntersection(""11,12,13,14;14,15,16""));
}

@Test
public void test_20_21_22_x_45_46_47() {
    assertEquals("""", findIntersection(""20,21,22;45,46,47""));
}

@Test
public void test_77_78_79_x_78_79_80_81_82() {
    assertEquals(""78,79"", findIntersection(""77,78,79;78,79,80,81,82""));
}

@Test
public void test_33_35_x_3_18_26_35() {
    assertEquals(""35"", findIntersection(""33,35;3,18,26,35""));
}

@Test
public void test_33_x_3_4() {
    assertEquals("""", findIntersection(""33;3,4""));
}


An alternative implementation

Consider this alternative implementation that passes all the tests:

private String findIntersection(String input) {
    String[] parts = input.split("";"");
    String[] arr1 = parts[0].split("","");
    String[] arr2 = parts[1].split("","");
    return findIntersection(arr1, arr2);
}

private String findIntersection(String[] arr1, String[] arr2) {
    StringBuilder builder = new StringBuilder();
    for (int pos1 = 0, pos2 = 0; pos1 &lt; arr1.length &amp;&amp; pos2 &lt; arr2.length; ) {
        int value1 = Integer.parseInt(arr1[pos1]);
        int value2 = Integer.parseInt(arr2[pos2]);

        if (value1 == value2) {
            builder.append(value1).append("","");
            ++pos1;
            ++pos2;
        } else if (value1 &lt; value2) {
            ++pos1;
        } else {
            ++pos2;
        }
    }
    if (builder.length() == 0) {
        return """";
    }
    return builder.substring(0, builder.length() - 1);
}


This implementation has an advantage and disadvantage compared to yours:


Advantages:


It doesn't always convert all input values to integers. For example when you have a long list and a short list, and it turns out that they cannot have an intersection, the rest of the long list will not be converted to integers
It should be faster to generate the output from a StringBuilder than from a LinkedHashSet

Disadvantage: in common cases it converts input values to numbers twice.
This is because in every step of the while loop, when only one of the positions advance, then on the next step the other number will be converted to integer again.


There is possibly one more advantage:
it's not clear if in the output the values should be separated by single commas,
or by comma + space as in yours (and in the output of Set.toString).
Since the values are separated by , in the input,
I would assume the same rule for the output as well,
but I could be wrong.

  Each test case contain two semicolon delimited sorted lists of numbers in ascending order, whose numbers are separated by a comma.
  
  Print out the ascending order sorted intersection of the lists, one per line.
  Print empty new line in case the lists have no intersection


Solution:

import java.io.File;

  78, 79
  35


I wanted to take advantage of the fact the lists were sorted, but I fear my efforts only served to render my code convoluted and inefficient. What do you think?
","This is a fine implementation. 
It's well-formatted and nicely written.
I find the idea of using a LinkedHashSet quite clever and interesting.
There are a couple of points to improve though.

You have a bug

Do you notice something fishy here?


while (foo[i] &gt; bar[j] &amp;&amp; j &lt; bar.length) {
    j++;
}
if (foo[i] &lt; bar[j]) {



The condition in the while checks foo[i] &gt; bar[j] before j &lt; bar.length.
So when j reaches bar.length,
this will throw an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.

Flipping the &amp;&amp; may seem like an obvious remedy.
But it won't be enough,
because of the next if statement after the while loop,
you'll again have the problem if j has already reached bar.length.

An example input to demonstrate this issue: 33;3,4

Unit testing

It's always handy to have some unit tests around when solving challenges like this.
For example:

@Test
public void test_9_10_11_x_33_34_35() {
    assertEquals("""", findIntersection(""9,10,11;33,34,35""));
}

@Test
public void test_3_7_8_22_x_11_22() {
    assertEquals(""22"", findIntersection(""3,7,8,22;11,22""));
}

@Test
public void test_11_12_13_14_x_14_15_16() {
    assertEquals(""14"", findIntersection(""11,12,13,14;14,15,16""));
}

@Test
public void test_20_21_22_x_45_46_47() {
    assertEquals("""", findIntersection(""20,21,22;45,46,47""));
}

@Test
public void test_77_78_79_x_78_79_80_81_82() {
    assertEquals(""78,79"", findIntersection(""77,78,79;78,79,80,81,82""));
}

@Test
public void test_33_35_x_3_18_26_35() {
    assertEquals(""35"", findIntersection(""33,35;3,18,26,35""));
}

@Test
public void test_33_x_3_4() {
    assertEquals("""", findIntersection(""33;3,4""));
}


An alternative implementation

Consider this alternative implementation that passes all the tests:

private String findIntersection(String input) {
    String[] parts = input.split("";"");
    String[] arr1 = parts[0].split("","");
    String[] arr2 = parts[1].split("","");
    return findIntersection(arr1, arr2);
}

private String findIntersection(String[] arr1, String[] arr2) {
    StringBuilder builder = new StringBuilder();
    for (int pos1 = 0, pos2 = 0; pos1 &lt; arr1.length &amp;&amp; pos2 &lt; arr2.length; ) {
        int value1 = Integer.parseInt(arr1[pos1]);
        int value2 = Integer.parseInt(arr2[pos2]);

        if (value1 == value2) {
            builder.append(value1).append("","");
            ++pos1;
            ++pos2;
        } else if (value1 &lt; value2) {
            ++pos1;
        } else {
            ++pos2;
        }
    }
    if (builder.length() == 0) {
        return """";
    }
    return builder.substring(0, builder.length() - 1);
}


This implementation has an advantage and disadvantage compared to yours:


Advantages:


It doesn't always convert all input values to integers. For example when you have a long list and a short list, and it turns out that they cannot have an intersection, the rest of the long list will not be converted to integers
It should be faster to generate the output from a StringBuilder than from a LinkedHashSet

Disadvantage: in common cases it converts input values to numbers twice.
This is because in every step of the while loop, when only one of the positions advance, then on the next step the other number will be converted to integer again.


There is possibly one more advantage:
it's not clear if in the output the values should be separated by single commas,
or by comma + space as in yours (and in the output of Set.toString).
Since the values are separated by , in the input,
I would assume the same rule for the output as well,
but I could be wrong.
But if I'm right,
then to get the right output you would have to strip the spaces from the result of the Set.toString call.

0,0,0,What am I losing when using extension tubes instead of a macro lens?,"After playing around with macro photography on-the-cheap (read: reversed lens, rev. lens mounted on a straight lens, passive extension tubes), I would like to get further with this. The problems with the techniques I used is that focus is manual and aperture control is problematic at best. This limited my setup to still subjects (read: dead insects) Now, as spring is approaching, I want to be able to shoot live insects. I believe that for this, autofocus and settable aperture will be of great help.

So, one obvious but expensive option is a macro lens (say, EF 100mm Macro) However, I am not really interested in yet another prime lens. An alternative is the electrical extension tubes.

Except for maximum focusing distance, what am I losing when using tubes (coupled with a fine lens, say EF70-200/2.8) instead of a macro lens?
",ysap,https://photo.stackexchange.com/users/1024,"I just got extension tubes, so here's the skinny.


  ...what am I losing when using tubes...?


A very considerable amount of light!  Increasing that distance from the end of the lens to the sensor can cut your light several stops.  Combined with the fact that you'll usually shoot stopped down - expect to need to increase your ISO considerably.

The fact the macro's are usually considered very very sharp, although I believe that 70-200mm 2.8 is supposed to be quite sharp.

The ultra low distortion typical of many macros.

I wouldn't worry too much about the bokeh since the DOF will still be quite limited.

Coupled on my 50mm, a full 60mm'ish extension tube results in a DOF of about a couple inches in front of the lens.  On my 70-300, its probably around 2-3 feet in front of the lens to about a foot in front of the lens.

Honest.  Those two files, with given contents are what I use on all my pi's.  They boot and immediately connect to my wireless router.  DHCP negotiation provides an address, and my router resolves the hostname to the proper IP address.   Make sure to name each PI appropriately via /etc/hostname.

The weirdness in the 'interfaces' file in the trailing 'iface default...' is needed, otherwise the wireless wpa connection won't come up.

The wpa_supplicant.conf file can have multiple 'network={' entries too, I used to take my pi to work... plug it in and voila, it connected automagically there too, work's configuration was a bit more convoluted though.  Included here as an example, add/replace the following in the wpa_supplicant.conf file:

    phase2=""auth=MSCHAPV2""

Essentially, it scans the wpa_supplicant.conf file and connects to the first network it finds that matches.  Very handy.  It's possible to make it connect to any 'open' network automatically this way too.  Not the smartest thing to do, but do-able.

The wpa_supplicant.conf file can have multiple 'network={' entries too, I used to take my pi to work... plug it in and voila, it connected automagically there too, work's configuration was a bit more convoluted though.  Included here as an example, add/replace the following in the wpa_supplicant.conf file:

network={
    ssid=""THE_OFFICE""
    scan_ssid=1
    key_mgmt=WPA-EAP
    eap=PEAP
    identity=""WORK_USERNAME""
    password=""WORK_PASSWORD""
    phase1=""peaplabel=0""
    phase2=""auth=MSCHAPV2""
    id_str=""SOME_DESCRIPTIVE_NAME""
}


Essentially, it scans the wpa_supplicant.conf file and connects to the first network it finds that matches.  Very handy.  It's possible to make it connect to any 'open' network automatically this way too.  Not the smartest thing to do, but do-able.

2819,2819,4488,What could be causing this sine on 7810 output when powering BLDC fan?,"I'm powering a 12 V computer fan with a simple 7810 circuit shown here:



When the fan is connected to the regulator, on the output I get this wave:



When I zoom out in time, I get something that looks like this:



For those who can't be bothered to click on the image, the distance between the peaks is almost 10 ms.

When I zoom out a bit more, I can see that there is another wave here riding on top of those peaks like this:



The higher top peaks have peak voltage of 13.4 V and the lower peaks are 12 V. The peaks on the bottom side which go together with 12 V peaks are 8.8 V and the bottom peaks of 13.4 V top peaks are 8.6 V.  

So any ideas what could be causing this? 

UPDATE

Here's the input waveform with the output peaks:



The input peaks are 10 ms apart and are in phase with AC line transitions, as expected since the AC frequency here is 50 Hz. The input is coming from a diode bridge rectifier. The input voltage is a bit high since I changed the original 1N4007 diodes with STPS2H100 Schottky diodes because I initially believed that one of the input diodes developed a short.

I can't determine the exact relationship between the input and output wave. When I trigger by one of the waves, the other is flowing from left to right on the screen.

I know abstract class how to declare and rules.But i need more real time example(like magento).

thanks in advance
",sivakumar,https://magento.stackexchange.com/users/5373,"A class can be declared as abstract for 2 reasons.  


It contains abstract methods
That class should not be instantiated.  


In magento's case most of the abstract classes fall in the second case.
Classes like Mage_Catalog_Model_Abstract and Mage_Core_Model_Abstract are never instantiated. They are just used as a common ancestor for other classes.
Just search in the code for extends Mage_Core_Model_Abstract.  

The ""abstract"" classes contain common behavior of all child classes but they don't actually do something without some configuration values.  

Let's take for example Mage_Core_Model_Abstract. This is a common model for all other models that map to one table (or more tables for the eav entities).  But the base class should never be instantiated.

It contains abstract methods
That class should not be instantiated.  


In magento's case most of the abstract classes fall in the second case.
Classes like Mage_Catalog_Model_Abstract and Mage_Core_Model_Abstract are never instantiated. They are just used as a common ancestor for other classes.
Just search in the code for extends Mage_Core_Model_Abstract.  

The ""abstract"" classes contain common behavior of all child classes but they don't actually do something without some configuration values.  

Let's take for example Mage_Core_Model_Abstract. This is a common model for all other models that map to one table (or more tables for the eav entities).  But the base class should never be instantiated.
For example you can call $model-&gt;save() on a child class because that one has a mapping to (at least) a table but you cannot call it on the abstract class. But the save method works the same for all the child models so no need to implement it in all the child classes.

506,506,789,What makes LSBit steganography detectable? And what would help in concealing it?,"In a project of mine I took a 24-bit bitmap image and I performed LSBit steganography over it (saved a black and white image inside each of the planes R, G, B) using pixel shuffling and xor encryption.

Is my stenography easy to detect? And what would it take to conceal it? 
",Ahmed Ihsan Tawfeek,https://crypto.stackexchange.com/users/12003,"A general theoretical answer to the title's What makes LSBit steganography detectable? is that in normal images, the LSBit of a pixel in some channel is correlated to higher-order bits in the same pixel and channel, that pixel in other channels, and adjacent pixels, in ways that mere replacement of LSBit tends to strongly alter.

One simple way to improve that is adding noise or blurr to a degree such that the LSBit is nearly indistinguishable from random, in which case it can then be replaced by something equally indistinguishable from random (as resulting from good encryption) with little chance of detection versus an equally noisy/blurry image. Next step is changing only few bits at locations dependent on a key (towards that goal it is necessary to have a small payload, as previously pointed), and have the other pixels randomly noisy according to a good model of the natural image.

From a practical standpoint, sending uncompressed 24-bit bitmap images somewhat is a red flag that basic stego is in use. That would be somewhat less apparent with an additional step of JPEG lossless compression, or PNG or GIF conversion (lossy compression would destroy the hidden message given the LSBit encoding used; more sophisticated stenographic schemes survive that). Notice that sending noisy/blurry images without lossy compression is a waste of bandwidth, and could also raise alarm.

I suggest two ""easy to detect"" tests, to be applied comparatively on your image with stego (after decompression if a lossless compression step is added), and normal images that could be allegedly sent, at least including the one you start from.


Show as an 8-color image the 3 LSBits of each pixel; that can be done by changing each byte x in each RGB plane to ~((x&amp;1)-1). It there something perceptibly remarkable for your image with stego? Update: a 64 or 512-color image using (x&lt;&lt;6)+32 or (x&lt;&lt;5)+16 might also be interesting. (note:  the three expressions are for C, and assume truncation to octet. ~((x&amp;1)-1) yields 0x00 if the low bit of x is clear, 0xFF otherwise).

4200,4200,6698,Android Activity - Is it common to have a lot of code in one activity class?,"My one activity seems to have grown quite a bit and I feel like that things should be more object oriented somehow. I think it happens because I am just learning and therefore keep adding different views, to see things working. Before I know it, it has gotten big.

I have subclassed things like LinearLayout, ViewFlipper, Button, TextView, etc etc and thought that providing constructors for these classes that take arguments like textsize, font, layout parameters, background color etc etc might help the situation and actually might lend itself more towards OOP common design paradigms. Doing it this way of course means that my constructor will have tons of arguments.

I was wondering if I could get some feedback on this approach above: should I use my subclasses to my advantage for a more OOP design, or do some activities just naturally have lots of code? Thanks!

That's not a good idea. Widgets are not designed to be extended as a means of configuration. Moreover, it is not necessary, as all the things you list can (and should) be defined in XML layout resources.


  do some activities just naturally have lots of code?

I think it happens because I am just learning and therefore keep adding different views, to see things working. Before I know it, it has gotten big.

I have subclassed things like LinearLayout, ViewFlipper, Button, TextView, etc etc and thought that providing constructors for these classes that take arguments like textsize, font, layout parameters, background color etc etc might help the situation and actually might lend itself more towards OOP common design paradigms. Doing it this way of course means that my constructor will have tons of arguments.

I was wondering if I could get some feedback on this approach above: should I use my subclasses to my advantage for a more OOP design, or do some activities just naturally have lots of code? Thanks!

That's not a good idea. Widgets are not designed to be extended as a means of configuration. Moreover, it is not necessary, as all the things you list can (and should) be defined in XML layout resources.

5207,5207,8275,How important is centring dual-pivot brakes?,"My road bike has Shimano dual-pivot caliper brakes like these.


Whenever I remove or refit the mudguards, or even sometimes just getting the wheel out, they seem to go slightly off-centre, by which I mean rotated around the mounting.

The effect of this is that, when the brakes are applied one pad contacts the rim before the other. Looking carefully the wheel also moves a little to the left or right as one pad pushes it to the side.

I try to rotate the brakes so that both pads contact the rim at the same time to minimise this movement, but as the act of tightening the mounting screw also rotates the brakes slightly, this is tricky.

So the question is - does it matter much if one pad makes contact slightly before the other? What are the likely effects of it doing so?
",James Bradbury,https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/users/5337,"The danger of this is your rim may begin to rub the brake pad – especially when you put in hard out-of-the-saddle efforts.

In theory, if your caliper has become off-centre then one pad will have come closer to the rim and the other will have come further away. You should simply be able to push and rotate the caliper by hand back into a central position without loosening (or tightening) the retaining nut. Pull the brake lever a couple of times and if the caliper does not return to a central position, your brake requires balancing i.e. one pad is moving more than the other towards the rim and causing them not to touch the rim at the same time.

3355,3355,5352,Key-agreement protocol in a REST API,"I have a C# REST API which exposes some methods over the HTTP protocol. The API is intended to be used my my Android applocation (Java) which is currently in the makings.

Since the app is in an early development stage, and hasn't been released yet, I access the API methods using http://example.com/resources/item17 without any additional security. However, as soon as the app is released, I don't want anyone but my app users to access the API. 

My idea is to generate some kind of unique key in my C# + Android code. A simplified version to give you the idea:

int key = DateTime.Now.Minute * Math.PI * 5;


This would make the request look something like:

`http://example.com/resources/item17?key=1234567`


The C# API would verify this before sending a response. 

The only way to figure out how the key is generated would be to reverse my Android code (which will be obfuscated at that point).

Does this sound like a good solution, or do you have any other suggestions?
",Johan,https://security.stackexchange.com/users/31864,"Your solution relies on the assumption that reverse-engineering of an obfuscated app is hard. However, this assumption does not match experience. Therefore, one cannot really tell that your solution is good.

However, maybe your solution is the best that can be done (not the same thing as ""good""). The alternative is user authentication. Namely, each app instance would get its own authentication key; then, it is up to the server to accept a key or reject it. This gives you the ability to revoke a key which appears to have been reverse-engineered; it may also give you legal leverage to prosecute offenders.

If you do pursue the concept of generating a time-based key in the app, then at least do it with the proper cryptographic tools. In this case, use HMAC: encode the current time into some bytes, then compute HMAC/SHA-1 (or HMAC/SHA-256, whichever is easiest for you) on these bytes, using a hardcoded key. The hardcoded key is the target for reverse-engineering. Using HMAC will at least protect you from key reconstruction by analysis of the output: the attacker will really have to do some actual code disassembly. You will also need the app to send its notion of ""current time"" as an extra parameter, because you cannot rely on the client device being well synchronized.

int key = DateTime.Now.Minute * Math.PI * 5;


This would make the request look something like:

`http://example.com/resources/item17?key=1234567`


The C# API would verify this before sending a response. 

The only way to figure out how the key is generated would be to reverse my Android code (which will be obfuscated at that point).

Does this sound like a good solution, or do you have any other suggestions?
","Your solution relies on the assumption that reverse-engineering of an obfuscated app is hard. However, this assumption does not match experience. Therefore, one cannot really tell that your solution is good.

However, maybe your solution is the best that can be done (not the same thing as ""good""). The alternative is user authentication. Namely, each app instance would get its own authentication key; then, it is up to the server to accept a key or reject it. This gives you the ability to revoke a key which appears to have been reverse-engineered; it may also give you legal leverage to prosecute offenders.

If you do pursue the concept of generating a time-based key in the app, then at least do it with the proper cryptographic tools. In this case, use HMAC: encode the current time into some bytes, then compute HMAC/SHA-1 (or HMAC/SHA-256, whichever is easiest for you) on these bytes, using a hardcoded key. The hardcoded key is the target for reverse-engineering. Using HMAC will at least protect you from key reconstruction by analysis of the output: the attacker will really have to do some actual code disassembly. You will also need the app to send its notion of ""current time"" as an extra parameter, because you cannot rely on the client device being well synchronized.

(None of this being exclusive with running the whole thing in HTTPS, which is usually a good idea when security matters, but is really another subject here.)

We know two of Rand's:


Question: How to cleanse Saidin? Answer: Unknown, but Herid said it ""stated sound principles in both high philosophy and natural philosophy.""
Question: How can I win the Last Battle and survive? Answer: ""The north and the east must be as one. The west and the south must be as one. The two must be as one. If you would live, you must die.""



Edit: The third question will apparently be revealed in the forthcoming (print) encyclopaedia. (Source)



I don't think we know any of Moiraine's. We get to witness Mat's 3+

Related: What did Rand ask the Aelfinn?
",NikolaiDante,https://scifi.stackexchange.com/users/8413,"Just rereading the series from the beginning after reading AMoL. From Moiraine's discussion with Thom in TSR Ch. 17, we might infer at least two questions:


She has asked about her fate and the fate of her companions from her assertion that she can promise Thom that he will not die in Tanchico and that they will meet again because he will survive Tarabon (p. 245-246). Does she know how much later they will meet again at this point? Not sure, but such knowledge might help to stiffen her resolve about how she will deal with Lanfear after she goes through the rings in Rhuidean. Inferring the question was about more than Thom because she seems to know in a way that exceeds mere caution that Ny and El will need some help staying alive in Tanchico (and along the way back).
She asked about Owyn's circumstances. No evidence before or since that she had collected this info elsewhere. (Not that we ever get the answer...) I've looked at the phrasing carefully, and I don't think she's using sleight of tongue here to suggest she has info that she doesn't. Plus Thom perceives sympathy and regret from her, though he tries to deny it. This tracks with her knowing about this tragedy in her future sweetie's past.


Granted, these are inferences, but now that we know all we're going to get except info to be dropped in the forthcoming Encyclopedia, they fit the story.

We know two of Rand's:


Question: How to cleanse Saidin? Answer: Unknown, but Herid said it ""stated sound principles in both high philosophy and natural philosophy.""
Question: How can I win the Last Battle and survive? Answer: ""The north and the east must be as one. The west and the south must be as one. The two must be as one. If you would live, you must die.""



Edit: The third question will apparently be revealed in the forthcoming (print) encyclopaedia. (Source)



I don't think we know any of Moiraine's. We get to witness Mat's 3+

Related: What did Rand ask the Aelfinn?
","Just rereading the series from the beginning after reading AMoL. From Moiraine's discussion with Thom in TSR Ch. 17, we might infer at least two questions:


She has asked about her fate and the fate of her companions from her assertion that she can promise Thom that he will not die in Tanchico and that they will meet again because he will survive Tarabon (p. 245-246). Does she know how much later they will meet again at this point? Not sure, but such knowledge might help to stiffen her resolve about how she will deal with Lanfear after she goes through the rings in Rhuidean. Inferring the question was about more than Thom because she seems to know in a way that exceeds mere caution that Ny and El will need some help staying alive in Tanchico (and along the way back).
She asked about Owyn's circumstances. No evidence before or since that she had collected this info elsewhere. (Not that we ever get the answer...) I've looked at the phrasing carefully, and I don't think she's using sleight of tongue here to suggest she has info that she doesn't. Plus Thom perceives sympathy and regret from her, though he tries to deny it. This tracks with her knowing about this tragedy in her future sweetie's past.


Granted, these are inferences, but now that we know all we're going to get except info to be dropped in the forthcoming Encyclopedia, they fit the story. Moiraine has known about the doorframe for some time now. I can picture her formulating a first question with exact wording, and then having a path A/B/C for the other two depending on the answer to the first (as opposed to Mat's just blurting out what's on his mind at the time).

",Corven Dallas,https://rpg.stackexchange.com/users/11520,"In Dungeons and Dragons 3.5

Rage says, in part,


  While raging, a barbarian cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except for Balance, Escape Artist, Intimidate, and Ride), the Concentration skill, or any abilities that require patience or concentration, nor can he cast spells or activate magic items that require a command word, a spell trigger (such as a wand), or spell completion (such as a scroll) to function. He can use any feat he has except Combat Expertise, item creation feats, and metamagic feats. (PH 25).


That raging restricts other abilities requiring patience and concentration, but never specifies what those might be, means the DM has a free hand in declaring certain tasks require patience and concentration and therefore are beyond the raging barbarian. But the DM should probably rarely place such restrictions on tasks, given the limits present later in the description of rage.

Thus, as no mention's made of the raging creature being unable to do it, fighting defensively (PH 140) remains an option, as does total defense (PH 142).

It is odd, but the Player's Handbook just doesn't restrict rage beyond these limits. The game says that if it's not on this list (or specifically prohibited by an option in a later book), the barbarian can probably do it while raging; so it's perfectly acceptable for a barbarian, for example, to apply extra sneak attack damage if he has any, the target's vulnerable to it, and the circumstances mean he'd inflict it; fight defensively or use total defense; attempt disarms or otherwise use nonlethal force; and take the withdraw action.

The goal is to limit the raging barbarians' actions in exchange for increased combat prowess not precisely simulate violent psychopathy in a table top role-playing game. In this case an exclusive list is better than an inclusive list (i.e. the raging barbarian can't do these things versus the raging barbarian can only do these things) because the game knew dozens of books with far more options would follow, so rather than limiting the raging barbarian to actions--requiring every future option to note if a barbarian could use it while raging--, it prevents him from taking some actions, so the raging barbarian can use future options freely.



In Pathfinder

Rage says, in part,


  While in rage, a barbarian cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration.


And then omits the remainder. Without the rest of the list it's in the DM's hands as to what, exactly, requires ""patience and concentration.""

A cursory search of the skills turned up nothing explicitly requiring patience, in feats only the aptly named Patient Strike would seem to need it, and the bonus from a traveler's dictionary is increased if the user is patient. But the concept of concentration is loaded with meaning. Concentration is what's needed to cast spells (""To cast a spell you must concentrate""), for instance, and at least one use of the skill Use Magic Device requires concentration.

But the exclusions given for D&amp;D 3.5's rage aren't otherwise present, so a raging barbarian can use Combat Expertise, magic items, and other D&amp;D 3.5 restricted options if the DM rules these don't require patience or concentration.

5356,5356,8505,Responding to players paying exclusively with gold coins,"I noticed that my players would pay everything in gold. A simple piece of bread? 1 copper. ""Here, have a gold and keep the change."" They get into a tavern. A beer! Here, have a gold coin and keep the change. They would give beggars gold coins like they are candies. They make a donation to the church. 10gp. That's a stupid amount of money in fiction. But for them that's nothing. They always spend their money on the most expensive stuff in the tavern and would request the inn keeper to open the most expensive bottle of elven wine he has and the players will pay 3 times the price of that bottle. Why? We're rich we don't care!

Most of the time, NPC will have never seen a gold coin in their life. A inn keeper maybe. A farmer, forget about that. My players don't really think about the social and economical consequences of that and I'd like that to change.

First, I have no idea how I should have my NPCs react except having them jump like they won the lottery. That would just encourage the players to continue. I want them to understand this is weird, unusual and almost out of character. I don't want to punish them, I want them to understand that would be the equivalent of donating 25,000$ to the girl at Starbucks.

Second, how would the setting change? Suddenly there's this town where the PCs are spending money like they don't know what to do with it. And as a matter of fact..they frequently don't. In my settings there are no Magic weapon Wal-Mart. Magic items are special and you can't simply buy them in a random village.

Edit: Assuming I'm playing in D&amp;D 3.5 (which is not the case but it's irrelevant anyway because the system is not important. I play in a D&amp;D 3.5-ish setting). Also assume I follow the recommended money-per-level table. I couldn't find the D&amp;D one but the one for Pathfinder is similar. I usually don't give them the equivalent of the loot in money. I split the loot like this: 75% of the loot in item and the rest in a mix of coins and random objects.
",MrJinPengyou,https://rpg.stackexchange.com/users/4000,"Other answers (including my own comment above) address possible reasons your players are doing this, and possible solutions to mitigate it. But you're not asking for value judgements or how to stop their behavior, so here's my best shot at a neutral analysis of how a D&amp;D type setting could respond to the behavior.

These are some responses I've used, or considered using. They aren't intended to be used all at once, and some are much harsher than others. Players engaging in this kind of action are calling attention to themselves, and the world will respond accordingly, but as Flamma points out punishing players is a bad idea. These are possible reactions, intended to make players more aware of the consequences of their actions, create complications, or give the world a bit more depth. Consider these springboards for your own ideas, and always consider what you're teaching the players about your game and your world before you do something drastic or mean.

First, a little context

Depending on the setting this behavior isn't quite as shocking as you're making it out; a gold coin in most D&amp;D editions is worth 10 silver, not 100. Still, the denomination is unusual and even if a place of business makes hundreds of gold a day they're unlikely to see a lot of gold coins go through the till.

""I can't take that; nobody here can make change for it.""

Sure, the party isn't expecting the local innkeep to make change for a platinum piece... but nobody else can either. It's like trying to pay someone with a barrel of crude oil; sure it's worth a lot, but what is Bob the Fishmonger going to do with it?

Same applies to objets d'art, handfuls of gems, and rare/ancient/foreign coins. Finding someone who can evaluate and buy their stuff could be a fun RP adventure, and there are all kinds of stories you can tell around an auction house.

Lavish them with inconvenient praise

Your players are clearly disgustingly rich philanthropists with no sense of proportion. Swamp them with beggars, inundate them with charity representatives, give them tedious award ceremonies to attend in their own honor. If they can't maintain the level of charity to which the locals become accustomed, turn the crowds against them, for reasons the next point makes clear.

This is largely going to be local color, but if the party wants to engage then it give them some toothy moral dilemmas.

The economy booms and crashes

First everyone runs out to spend their newfound wealth. It spreads around, people get excited, luxury items become popular, new businesses open, people move into the suddenly prosperous town... but it's all supported by itinerant charity.

Soon after the party stops their lavish spending or move away, the town can no longer afford its new luxurious tastes. Businesses close, investments are lost, unemployment rises. With an increased population the town can't return to its old status quo: no longer able to afford imported food and having grown faster than its farms could plant and harvest more crops, the larger population begins to starve.

This could provide a lot of new hook: helping revitalize the town could go a lot of different ways, or maybe the villain sweeps in to save them and gets a townfull of people who really don't like the PCs.

Give 'em lackeys

Sherlock Holmes' Baker Street Irregulars come to mind: when someone tips well, he attracts a lot of willing employees. I'd be surprised if some enterprising young urchin didn't pop up to be an eager errand boy. Bonus points if he's got some connection to a plot.

Induct 'em

A high-profile group with plenty of money offers just the kind of publicity and profit many organizations are looking for. Adventuring clubs, philanthropic societies, shady organizations, all would love to have the party as members. Of course, there's an admission fee. And membership dues. And obligations to be fulfilled. But it's very prestigious and members get discounted services at participating locations!

Seriously though, membership can provide access to exclusive quests and resources, an information network, accountants and lawyers to handle the legal issues (see some of the point below), and so forth.

Mug 'em

Clearly these newcomers are rich and naive. Every mugger, pickpocket, cat burglar, confidence man and used car salesman in town is going to see a golden (sorry) opportunity. The party's going to be beset by thieves, get-rich-quick scammers, and people trying to sell them a London Bridge / Eiffel Tower boxed set.

This can provide a lot of interesting action/RP, and maybe even a new adventure: a renowned cat burglar comes to town to steal from the PCs, and the PCs are hired to catch him?

Refuse the coin, call the cops

What's the modern reaction to paying for a stick of gum with a $100 bill? You check if it's counterfeit. If a group of people make a habit of this, the law is going to start making inquiries.

This can go a lot of ways: uncover corruption, make a friend in law enforcement, flee and get a tracker or bounty hunter on their tail.

Note: this is why you see people biting coins in old films. Your teeth scratch off the paint on a fake and show the dark lead underneath. [There's a common misconception that you bite the coin to test its softness, because gold is softer than most other metals. This is incorrect; pure gold coins would wear down just rattling against each other in your pocket, so the gold is always alloyed with another metal to make it harder. If anything, a lead coin (lead was used in counterfeiting because it's about the same weight as gold) would be softer.]

Bring in the bureaucrats

Once the PCs are found to not be counterfeiters, swindlers, or thieves (not necessarily an easy thing to prove, given where most adventurers get their wealth), send in the tax collector and the customs agent. Moving undeclared wealth over borders? Dodging taxes through border hopping or simply not paying? Oh, you say you have no permanent place of residence? Then we'll have to collect your full dues and fines right now, and don't worry; your place of residence for the next six months is the local jail.

Bureaucrats are the nuclear option unless the party likes this kind of thing. Use with caution.

""Those counterfeit coins aren't mine! I got them off this guy I killed... I mean... um.""

Seriously, what are the chances that all that junk the party finds in orc pockets is legit? Maybe the cops or the taxmen find something suspicious after all. Or maybe just explaining how they got their wealth is enough to get them in trouble.

See ""call the cops"" above, but with the added potential for uncovering a new evil plot for the party to stop based on the junk they've been hauling around.

""So that's where they're hiding.""

Regardless of how the local population responds, chances are that the party becomes very high-profile very quickly. Is anyone looking for the party? Say... maybe a recurring villain, or someone who wants to set them up as patsies, or a person from a PC's shady past, or someone with a quest for them to undertake?

This is a carte blanche excuse to bring in anyone you want. Be creative: bringing back minor but popular NPCs in a larger role is a favorite of mine.

So, check the hoses thoroughly, and if everything checks out. Then it's time to bring it to a reputable shop.

Hope this helps.

1915,1915,3047,How to get Ajax into a theme - without writing a plugin?,"Okay, I'm starting out with some AJAX stuff in a wordpress theme

1) I'm building a child theme OFF the thematic framework
2) My child theme has a header.php, index.php, functions.php and style.css (at this stage)

In my header.php I have the following (btw: the code is adapted from http://codex.wordpress.org/AJAX_in_Plugins):

&lt;?php
    if( !is_admin() ) {
 add_action('wp_ajax_my_special_action', 'my_action_callback');
 add_action('wp_ajax_nopriv_my_special_action', 'my_action_callback');
 $_ajax = admin_url('admin-ajax.php');    
}
?&gt;
&lt;script type=""text/javascript"" &gt;
jQuery(document).ready(function($) {

 var data = {
  action: 'my_special_action',
  whatever: 1234
 };

 jQuery.post('&lt;?php echo($_ajax); ?&gt;', data, function(response) {
  jQuery('#output').html('Got this from the server: ' + response);
 });

});
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;


Right so that's all cool - and it updates the OUTPUT div on the page with ""Got this from the server: 0""

I need a PHP function called ""my_action_callback"" - so in my theme's functions.php I have the following:

function my_action_callback() {

 $whatever = $_POST['whatever'];

 $whatever += 10;

    echo 'whatever now equals: ' . $whatever;

 die();
}


This is the ONLY function in my functions.php

To make sure the PHP function is working I stick my_action_callback() into my index.php - and it outputs ""whatever now equals: 10"" as expected.

HOWEVER - the AJAX response is always 'Got this from the server: 0'
Ajax never seems to get the response from the PHP function. 

I tried adding .ajaxError() to see if there were any errors - nope.

I tried adding the PHP functions to another plugin of mine - nope.

What am I missing that jQuery isn't doing the ajax bit for me?

Thanks in advance
",keranm,https://wordpress.stackexchange.com/users/1107,"Put those add_action functions in your functions.php file too. If they're in header.php, WordPress never registers them since header isn't loaded in AJAX. Also, you don't need that is_admin() check. The theme's header will never load in admin. So, your functions file should look like this:

add_action('wp_ajax_my_special_action', 'my_action_callback');
add_action('wp_ajax_nopriv_my_special_action', 'my_action_callback');
function my_action_callback() {

 $whatever = $_POST['whatever'];

 $whatever += 10;

    echo 'whatever now equals: ' . $whatever;

 die();
}


And the beginning of that part of your theme's header file should look like this:

&lt;?php
$_ajax = admin_url('admin-ajax.php');
?&gt;
&lt;script type=""text/javascript"" &gt;

1) I'm building a child theme OFF the thematic framework
2) My child theme has a header.php, index.php, functions.php and style.css (at this stage)

In my header.php I have the following (btw: the code is adapted from http://codex.wordpress.org/AJAX_in_Plugins):

&lt;?php
    if( !is_admin() ) {
 add_action('wp_ajax_my_special_action', 'my_action_callback');
 add_action('wp_ajax_nopriv_my_special_action', 'my_action_callback');
 $_ajax = admin_url('admin-ajax.php');    
}
?&gt;
&lt;script type=""text/javascript"" &gt;
jQuery(document).ready(function($) {

 var data = {
  action: 'my_special_action',
  whatever: 1234
 };

 jQuery.post('&lt;?php echo($_ajax); ?&gt;', data, function(response) {
  jQuery('#output').html('Got this from the server: ' + response);
 });

});
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;


Right so that's all cool - and it updates the OUTPUT div on the page with ""Got this from the server: 0""

I need a PHP function called ""my_action_callback"" - so in my theme's functions.php I have the following:

function my_action_callback() {

 $whatever = $_POST['whatever'];

 $whatever += 10;

    echo 'whatever now equals: ' . $whatever;

 die();
}


This is the ONLY function in my functions.php

To make sure the PHP function is working I stick my_action_callback() into my index.php - and it outputs ""whatever now equals: 10"" as expected.

HOWEVER - the AJAX response is always 'Got this from the server: 0'
Ajax never seems to get the response from the PHP function. 

I tried adding .ajaxError() to see if there were any errors - nope.

I tried adding the PHP functions to another plugin of mine - nope.

What am I missing that jQuery isn't doing the ajax bit for me?

Thanks in advance
","Put those add_action functions in your functions.php file too. If they're in header.php, WordPress never registers them since header isn't loaded in AJAX. Also, you don't need that is_admin() check. The theme's header will never load in admin. So, your functions file should look like this:

add_action('wp_ajax_my_special_action', 'my_action_callback');
add_action('wp_ajax_nopriv_my_special_action', 'my_action_callback');
function my_action_callback() {

 $whatever = $_POST['whatever'];

 $whatever += 10;

    echo 'whatever now equals: ' . $whatever;

 die();
}


And the beginning of that part of your theme's header file should look like this:

&lt;?php
$_ajax = admin_url('admin-ajax.php');
?&gt;
&lt;script type=""text/javascript"" &gt;

294,294,473,Is there a way to limit the range of the range pattern in awk?,"I am trying to use the awk range pattern to find all SQL select statements in a group of files, inspired by this stackoverflow answer.

From the awk manual:


  The pattern1, pattern2 form of an expression is called a range pattern.  It matches all input records starting with a record that matches pattern1, and continuing until a record that matches  pattern2,  inclusive.


My initial attempt was 

awk '/select/,/from/' *


where * in this case just represents a large number of varied files.

This returned several false hits on HTML select tags, so I refined my command to

awk '/[^&lt;]select[^&gt;]/,/from/' *


which seems to have eliminated most of those hits.

However, I still get some false hits from occurrences of the word ""select"" in a comment, and those hits produce very many lines of noise each before they eventually hit a ""from"" or the end of the file.
What I would like is for the range pattern not to register a match if there are more than, say, 10 lines between the ""select"" and the ""from"".

My question is: Can I make the range pattern fail to match if the number of lines between the match of pattern1 and the match of pattern2 exceeds a given threshold, and if so, how?

But on the VPN providers side of the connection, surely the VPN provider uses an ISP of some sort. So they send out requests I have made over their ISP, just as if I were sitting there using the ISP they pay for. And they send the data back to me, encrypted.

So on the ISP side they use, the data they send is unencrypted, so it can be understood by other sites/services.

If this is the case, am I not just pushing my data further along. Its still unencrypted but at a different end (VPNs Webside). Its only the data back to me, which is encrypted.

Thanks.
",FartumPower,https://security.stackexchange.com/users/66617,"Keep in mind that just because some traffic is not flowing inside a VPN doesn't necessarily mean that it is not secure or encrypted. The easy example would be HTTPS: the information you are exchanging with the server is encrypted even if you are not on a VPN. So, no VPN doesn't necessarily equal no security.

A VPN will not make you more secure in terms of anonimity (e.g. if you are trying to perform some not-so-legal operations online), but it will make communications more secure than they would be without it. Sure, the information will be unencrypted sooner or later, but in the meantime, you are encrypting it so that anybody listening on that section of the network will not be able to access your information.

I will give you another example: suppose you are running your own VPN server at home. You are out in a coffee shop and decide to browse the internet, but you connect first to the VPN.

",user43351,https://security.stackexchange.com/users/43351,"The difficulty of brute forcing an encryption system is based on the degree of randomness produced by the key.  When a key is less than the length of a file, there has to be some type of reuse, and this means less than perfect randomness and thus some small susceptibility to being brute forced.

Thus, in order to make something truly brute force proof against an attacker with unlimited resources and time, the only option is a truly random key that is the same length as the input and that has never been used as a key on another message.  This technique is actually very, very old and is known as a one time pad (or OTP).  An OTP is completely future secure as long as the key remains secret.  Since the key is random and only used once, the input bears no resemblance to the output and ""jfeidj"" could just as easily be ""attack"" as it could be ""dinner"".

That said, attackers don't have unlimited time or resources, so practically speaking, almost any modern symmetric algorithm will provide more than enough security even at key lengths as low as 128 bits or lower.  128 bit AES, for example, while ""technically"" able to be brute forced would take so long trying to brute force that chances are good that if every computer on the planet worked on nothing but cracking the message, the sun would die and the solar system get sucked in to a black hole before they finished cracking the message.  (Provided there aren't any unknown flaws in the algorithm and that the key is properly generated.)  If you make it 256bit, the heat death of the universe will come before you successfully brute force it.

Such “parenthifying” punctuation is something that could be omitted without great loss.  I don’t think you can use the comma there, because “or noun phrase” cannot be freely omitted without changing the overall meaning.  

Also, the indefinite article seems intended to distribute across noun and noun phrase in that sentence, and if you break it up with a comma, you lose that.

Yes, but you will need a convincing argument for why graduate school will go better next time than it did the first time you tried it.  It's easy to say ""I didn't care about grades and didn't work very hard, but I'll work harder this time,"" while actually working harder is much more difficult, so vague excuses may be discounted.

You could get lucky and find a school that is happy to give you another chance (perhaps a less prestigious department, which sees potential in you beyond what's typical for their students).  You might also be able to give a more concrete excuse for your past grades (for example, if there were external factors in your life that troubled you last time but won't apply this time).  Otherwise, the best way to demonstrate that things have changed is probably to succeed at something else.  Finding a job and doing well at it can show that you are now more mature and responsible than when you were a student, and successfully taking a few classes part-time can also look good.

So I'd suggest following a two-part strategy.  Try applying again with the best explanations/excuses you can offer, and see whether it works.  If it doesn't, then you should start thinking about longer-term methods to demonstrate that you've changed.

1762,1762,2796,Is a VPN really secure at the VPN providers side?,"Please forgive my basic ignorance regarding a VPN connection.

As I understand it, a VPN connection encrypts all the data between my computer and the VPN provider. Thus preventing my ISP from seeing my data.

But on the VPN providers side of the connection, surely the VPN provider uses an ISP of some sort. So they send out requests I have made over their ISP, just as if I were sitting there using the ISP they pay for. And they send the data back to me, encrypted.

So on the ISP side they use, the data they send is unencrypted, so it can be understood by other sites/services.

If this is the case, am I not just pushing my data further along. Its still unencrypted but at a different end (VPNs Webside). Its only the data back to me, which is encrypted.

Correct. A VPN is designed to give you a secure connection to the VPN provider; it essentially simulates your being physically on their network. For instance, a corporate VPN simulates being in the office physically connected to the corporate network. This is great when there's some reason to trust the VPN network more than the network you're on for the things you're doing; however, all it amounts to is substituting the VPN provider's network for the network you're on.

so when you do the command the destination port (ie the port 10.0.0.55 is listening ) is fine but when you do the command the source port is randomly generated by the os and that is the port 10.0.0.55 uses to reply back to the other pc that pc is behind a router so there have to be an specific port

",user2948982,https://stackoverflow.com/users/2948982,"I already solve this, the answer was to create a new struct sockaddr, open a socket for that struct bind it to the port you want and then call connect to the struct that the mount client is using and with you socket. That way you force the kernel not to choose the src port for you.
Note that you will have to do the same when you are going to ask the server (Where the filesystem you are trying to mount is) for the file handles. 
Also in the end of the mount client calls the mount function from the kernel and it puts a random port again for the src port, so this approach is good if you want to modify the kernel as well.

2597,2597,4131,"Buck converter with op-amp, inductor issues when load changes","I'm looking at the designs for a simple buck converter which has the P mosfet, inductor, capacitor and reverse based diode. Instead of PWM, I'm trying out to use an op-amp to switch the P mosfet but one thing that I notice is that if the load changes from low resistance to high resistance then the inductor spikes the voltage on the load to double what it is until it can re-stablise. (This is all in simulation)

Is this happening because I'm using the op-amp? How does using PWM affect the inductor in such a way that if the load would change from say 10 ohms to 100 ohms that the inductor won't spike the voltage? Perhaps PWM / fast switching keeps the inductor with such a low charge that when the load changes, the inductor doesn't have nearly enough voltage to do anything?

Cheers.
",2tails,https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/29571,"For any given load, a switcher will transfer a given amount of energy thousands of times per second. This is how the buck regulator works.

Let's say your op-amp is switching at 10kHz (because it's a slow sort of device and will have slew rate problems compared to other devices). Let's also say you are aiming to deliver 5V across a 10 ohm resistor. Resistor power is 25/10 watts = 2.5 watts. 

To calculate energy per switching cycle divide this power by frequency because power = joules per second. At 10kHz, the energy you transfer per switch cycle is 250\$\mu J\$. 

This energy powers your load resistor but, if you removed your load resistor, this energy gets dumped into the output capacitor and its voltage rises a little (or a lot) higher than normal.

Let's say your output capacitor is 10uF - if suddenly it was imbibed with 250\$\mu J\$, how much would it rise in voltage?

We know that capacitor energy is \$\dfrac{C V^2}{2}\$ therefore we can calculate the voltage rise and this is: - 

\$\sqrt{\dfrac{250\times 10^{-6} \times 2}{10\times 10^{-6}}}\$ = 7.07V.

It's a little bit subtler than this - in the above I assumed the capacitor was being charged with energy from a zero voltage state. In fact it already has 5V across it and this means that the previously stored energy + influx energy (from the inductor) is 125\$\mu J\$ + 250\$\mu J\$ = 375\$\mu J\$. 

If you do the reverse math, the peak voltage on the capacitor becomes 8.66V i.e. 3.66 volts higher than the 5V rail. 

You could put an argument together to consider the losses in the diode also - this may trim half a volt of the absolute peak voltage.

So, you either need to increase the capacitance a lot or, decrease the transfer energy by increasing the operating frequency. Modern switchers regularly operate at 500kHz and this means the energy per cycle reduces from 250\$\mu J\$ to 5\$\mu J\$ in this example.

Should this be the case (500kHz operation), the rogue energy from the inductor would make the capacitor's stored energy 130\$\mu J\$ and this means a peak voltage of 5.1 volts - probably quite acceptable for load dumping on a switcher.

Operating at higher frequencies requires faster silicon but, the ability to control load variations (and their repercussions), on a cyclic basis, means much tighter control of the output voltage.

This is just an example to see where you might be going wrong.

5325,5325,8462,SQL Agent powershell context reference,"At my new job, we have multiple named instances on each servers. 


Server1\Dev 
Server1\DevIntegrated 
Server1\QA


I have a SQL PowerShell script in the works that calls out to the OS, invokes Foo.exe but needs to pass a command line parameter (the connection string). A SQL Agent job will exist on each instance, with a step of type PowerShell, that needs to know what the current context is. i.e. This execution began on DevIntegrated. 

I have no desire to have every script start with 

$thisInstance = ""Dev""


eespecially as I'd have to edit that as we migrate to environments (new servers and named instances) in the upcoming months.   

If I start SQLPS, I can determine my instance by slicing and dicing the results of Get-Location or running

(Invoke-Sqlcmd -Query ""SELECT @@servername AS ServerName"" -SuppressProviderContextWarning).ServerName


When the SQL Agent starts a job of type PowerShell, it starts in the C:\windows\system32 The Get-Location route doesn't work as it's not in the SQLSERVER context. I can change into that context but I'll be at the ""root"" of SQL Server and won't know what instance I should be in. Using the Invoke-Sqlcmd route won't work either for same reason (technically, it times out as there is no default instance)

To the best of my knowledge, I've enumerated all the basic ""things"" I can Get into the job log but nothing seems to show SQLSERVER:\SQL\Server1\DevIntegrated


Get-ChildItem
Get-Host
Get-Location
Get-Process
Get-PSDrive
Get-PSProvider
Get-Service
Get-TraceSource
Get-Variable


Get-Process seems like I could use that and some voodoo of trying to cobble things together by hitting the instances and matching spids but that just sounds like a bloody-hack from hell. There must be something basic that I'm missing, can anyone shed some light?

Alternatives to PowerShell investigated

I had investigated using other job types and didn't get a satisfactory resolution. Research indicated the PowerShell listed under SQL Agent was SQLPS and starting an instance of it by right clicking on the Agent automagically dropped me into the correct location. It was only when I pasted my interactive code into the job step that I learned of the difference as previously mentioned.

Job type of OS put me into an identical state in that I could not find a way to determine which instance dropped me into the command shell. Sure, I could sqlcmd and get the value of @@servername but if I knew what connection to start sqlcmd, I wouldn't need to to query the database ;)

TSQL could probably work if we enable xp cmdshell but I'm not sure if they have it turned on---government facility and they can be persnickety on non-default settings. Even then, I'm stuck futzing with dynamic SQL and losing a lot of the expressiveness and power that PowerShell lends.

While a bit ungainly, I thought defining a variable at the first step and passing that to successor steps but research turned up this article Handling Multiple Job Steps (BOL) 


""Job steps must be atomic. A job cannot pass Boolean values, data, or numeric values between job steps. You can pass values from one Transact-SQL job step to another by using permanent tables or global temporary tables. You can pass values from one CmdExec job step to another by using files.""


I can't use common tricks like a well-known file/environment variables/registry setting that Foo.exe looks for as that would prevent concurrent execution across instances.

tl;dr

In a SQL Agent Job step of type PowerShell, how can you determine the instance of SQL Server that launched the process?
",billinkc,https://dba.stackexchange.com/users/2131,"If you look in SQL Server BOL, SQL Server Agent provides a set of ""tokens"" that it will substitute into both the job step command text and the output file (the later will prevent the GUI ""view"" button from working). These tokens seem to work for any type of step except T-SQL. 

http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms175575.aspx

So, if you have a SQL 2008 PowerShell step, you can start it with:

Server1\Dev 
Server1\DevIntegrated 
Server1\QA


I have a SQL PowerShell script in the works that calls out to the OS, invokes Foo.exe but needs to pass a command line parameter (the connection string). A SQL Agent job will exist on each instance, with a step of type PowerShell, that needs to know what the current context is. i.e. This execution began on DevIntegrated. 

I have no desire to have every script start with 

$thisInstance = ""Dev""


eespecially as I'd have to edit that as we migrate to environments (new servers and named instances) in the upcoming months.   

If I start SQLPS, I can determine my instance by slicing and dicing the results of Get-Location or running

(Invoke-Sqlcmd -Query ""SELECT @@servername AS ServerName"" -SuppressProviderContextWarning).ServerName


When the SQL Agent starts a job of type PowerShell, it starts in the C:\windows\system32 The Get-Location route doesn't work as it's not in the SQLSERVER context. I can change into that context but I'll be at the ""root"" of SQL Server and won't know what instance I should be in. Using the Invoke-Sqlcmd route won't work either for same reason (technically, it times out as there is no default instance)

To the best of my knowledge, I've enumerated all the basic ""things"" I can Get into the job log but nothing seems to show SQLSERVER:\SQL\Server1\DevIntegrated


Get-ChildItem
Get-Host
Get-Location
Get-Process
Get-PSDrive
Get-PSProvider
Get-Service
Get-TraceSource
Get-Variable


Get-Process seems like I could use that and some voodoo of trying to cobble things together by hitting the instances and matching spids but that just sounds like a bloody-hack from hell. There must be something basic that I'm missing, can anyone shed some light?

Alternatives to PowerShell investigated

I had investigated using other job types and didn't get a satisfactory resolution. Research indicated the PowerShell listed under SQL Agent was SQLPS and starting an instance of it by right clicking on the Agent automagically dropped me into the correct location. It was only when I pasted my interactive code into the job step that I learned of the difference as previously mentioned.

Job type of OS put me into an identical state in that I could not find a way to determine which instance dropped me into the command shell. Sure, I could sqlcmd and get the value of @@servername but if I knew what connection to start sqlcmd, I wouldn't need to to query the database ;)

TSQL could probably work if we enable xp cmdshell but I'm not sure if they have it turned on---government facility and they can be persnickety on non-default settings. Even then, I'm stuck futzing with dynamic SQL and losing a lot of the expressiveness and power that PowerShell lends.

While a bit ungainly, I thought defining a variable at the first step and passing that to successor steps but research turned up this article Handling Multiple Job Steps (BOL) 


""Job steps must be atomic. A job cannot pass Boolean values, data, or numeric values between job steps. You can pass values from one Transact-SQL job step to another by using permanent tables or global temporary tables. You can pass values from one CmdExec job step to another by using files.""


I can't use common tricks like a well-known file/environment variables/registry setting that Foo.exe looks for as that would prevent concurrent execution across instances.

tl;dr

In a SQL Agent Job step of type PowerShell, how can you determine the instance of SQL Server that launched the process?
","If you look in SQL Server BOL, SQL Server Agent provides a set of ""tokens"" that it will substitute into both the job step command text and the output file (the later will prevent the GUI ""view"" button from working). These tokens seem to work for any type of step except T-SQL. 

http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms175575.aspx

So, if you have a SQL 2008 PowerShell step, you can start it with:

$sqlInstance = ""$(ESCAPE_DQUOTE(SRVR))""

You may need to use MACH (machine name) and INST (just instance name) instead, because with the default instance SRVR == MACH, but with named instances SRVR == MACH\INST.

4915,4915,7826,How should hands that are EXTREMELY strong in one suit (10+ cards) be bid?,"I'm a bit of a bridge noob, but I'm kind of puzzled about this. Say I have a hand that is ridiculously strong in one suit, say at least 10 cards with all 4 honors (I'll use spades for the example suit). how should I bid? This is so many cards that almost nobody will be leading spades but me, so if another suit is trump, I'm flush out of luck.

Obviously I would want to end up playing a spade contract with a good potential for a slam, but if I open too high, say 5 spades, won't my opponents catch on pretty quickly and bid in their own suits or No-trump, just so my spades will be next to useless? They will likely have favorable distributions for their own suits since nearly all the spades are gone, which only worsens the fact. Then again, if I bid to low, my partner may not rebid, and while taking 12 tricks at a contract of 3S is obviously good, knowing you will have that many overtricks from the start seems kind of a waste.

Even if I held 12 or 13 spades, if I bid 7S, won't my opponents just bid 7NT and I'll never get to lead? How should hands with this heavy a distribution be bid to make the most of them?

(I've already said I'm not a very experienced bridge player, so if I'm making any glaring oversights don't hesitate in the slightest to bring them up.)



NOTE: I know these hands are extremely rare, but in all reality, every single possible hand is rare enough that studying bridge hands is actually quite useless because you'll never see the same hand again in your life...but we do it anyway because that's how we learn. Couldn't you tell anyone asking about a specific hand not to worry about it because it'll never show up again? :D
",Gordon Gustafson,https://boardgames.stackexchange.com/users/191,"If you have 10+ spades in your hand, you will never let a contract die out in 3S now, would you?

It really depends on the hand, but people play the following two conventions which might potentially be useful (of course, there might be others).


Namyats. This is to distinguish hands which are too strong for just preempting 4S. You show stronger hands by bidding 4D (taking spades as your suit), which you could potentially use here, though 10+ would probably be too strong. There are various followups which can be used to investigate slam.
4NT opening bid as Ace asking. Say you had AKQJxxxxxx, A,x,x. You could bid 4NT as asking for Aces, and bid the slam appropriately.


Anyway, hands with a 10+ suit are very rare and even experts have trouble with them (or rather, don't bother with them so much, because of the rarity).

As to your question about opponents taking out to their suit, why do you think that is likely to happen? It is quite risky for them to be bidding at the 5/6/7 level, without a running suit of their own. Your bidding at the 4/5/6/7 level would have taken out enough bidding space to make it unlikely they would be able to overcall easily (and find a fit). You seem to be also forgetting that you have a partner who could still hold some cards, and could easily double them and take them for a number. If they do bid, well, you can't help it, but I would say it is not as likely as you seem to think.



As to your edit.

Yes, any specific hand (down to the spots) is a low occurrence (in fact same chance for each hand!), but bidding systems are not geared towards finding the exact specific hand you have. Bidding systems are geared towards finding fits, distribution and strength with the ultimate goal of finding the right strain and level based on the scoring.

When talking about 'rarity', you should be thinking in terms of hand types rather than specific hands. So when someone says getting a 7 card spade suit is much more likely than getting a 10 card spade suit, they are not talking specific hands, but a set of hands. Take the set of all hands which have 7 card spade suit and the set of all hands which have a 10 card spade suit and compare the counts. 

When people say 10+ card suits are rare, they are talking about the whole set. 

You might never get the same hand dealt again, true, but the same hand type (say 15-17 balanced) might occur again frequently.

Bidding space is very limited, and trying to cater to rare hands can be inefficient use of that space.

","What you are after is virtualization, such as VMWare or, like you said, VirtualBox. These allow you to run any guest operating system within a host operating system, inside a window, just like you are after.

If you set the virtual machine to suspend (or 'save state') every time you are finished with it, you can have 'boot times' of something like 15 seconds.

VMWare and VirtualBox are probably the most reputable cross-platform virtual machine offerings (that are 'consumer friendly'). You could always give Xen a go, which is more for servers, instead of desktops PCs. Here is a guide on installing Windows XP on a Xen VM

2241,2241,3571,How can you buy train tickets at Oslo Airport?,"In June I will have to travel from Oslo Gardermoen airport to Oslo Central Station to catch the train to Finse. I already booked a ticket from Oslo central station to Finse (with NSB), but didn't want to be tied to a certain time for the ticket from Oslo airport to Oslo Central Station. 

As soon as I pick up my luggage I want to go to the train so that I have some time to spare in Oslo.

I was wondering how easy it is to buy a ticket at the airport, are there any vending machines around where you just can buy a ticket?
",ErikL,https://travel.stackexchange.com/users/12236,"There are actually several viable options, the cheapest would have been to buy a through ticket from the airport to Finse.

The most convenient option, but also the most expensive, is to take the Flytoget (Airport Express Train). Mo-Fr, the trains depart every ten minutes (x:00, x:10, x:20, etc), Sa+Su every twenty minutes (x:10, x:30, x:50) and take 19 or 22 minutes. They are however quite expensive with 170 NOK or about 21 Euros for a one-way ticket to the central station. You can travel without a paper ticket, which sounds quite simple, but you have to be careful not to charge yourself for a longer distance than actually travelled. Travelling from the airport is quite simple, as you must select your destination when swiping your card at the platform gate. If you travel to the airport, you must remember to swipe your card at one of the devices at the departing station, otherwise you will be charged 250 NOK (the tariff for the longest distance). There are also plenty of ticket machines where you can buy regular paper tickets and pay with cash or most credit and debit cards. If you want to pay with cash, be aware that the ticket machines won't accept larger bank notes than 200 NOK.

At least Mo-Fr, it is also a reasonable option to use the regular suburban trains instead of the express trains. They leave twice an hour (0:03 and 0:43) and take 23 minutes to the central station. These trains operate on Sa+Su as well, but not necessarily every hour. The ticket price is 90 NOK or about 11 Euros. You can buy tickets from the NSB/Ruter ticket machines or from the NSB ticket desk. If you are in a hurry, you can also buy your ticket on the train from the conductor, but in that case, have to pay an additional 40 NOK fee.

Be aware that the express and suburban trains are operated by different companies and their tickets are not interchangeable. Express train tickets are available at the orange ticket machines. Suburban train tickets are available at the red and gray ticket machines. 

There are also several bus lines operating from the airport, but if you are going to the central station, the bus lines are neither a cheaper nor faster option than the suburban trains.

  Grenade should not follow player to the next position.


**I am confused about this case: how to let grenade not change its position and get the blast on surface??
","You could model the grenade as a conventional rigidbody with an initial speed and have it affected by gravity. Add a script with an OnCollision method to trigger when it touches a vehicle or the ground.

There aren't traditional words, there are traditional senses. Compare:

  I love Firefly. Next to Twin Peaks it is my favourite programme.


I've deliberately picked a different ""transitional word"" to hopefully make it easier to see the point if you're perhaps over-thinking so.

In the first case here, next is indeed in a transitional sense—it serves to introduce the next sentence while also stating they are in a temporal order—and the comma makes sense.

In the second case next is not doing this transitional job, but telling us something about how the topic of discussion (Firefly) relates to another thing (Twin Peaks) in the writer's opinion. We don't want to separate it from the to; what would the now separated ""to Twin Peaks it is…"" even mean?

So, back to so.

So's transitional sense is ""used after a pause for thought to introduce a new topic, question or story."" In this sense you can remove it and not really lose much meaning, though might you lose impact. If you want your sentence to mean ""I am confident that …"" but with so serving this introductory role, then the comma might be a good idea for that reason. (It might also be a good idea to just cut it, but that's another matter).

Another sense of so is ""therefore"" or ""with the result that"". If you want so to say that the studies you mention in the previous sentence (along, perhaps, with earlier statements) is the reason why you have this confidence, then the comma is probably a bad idea.

I imagine you want the second of these two readings, and I'd therefore recommend that you don't use a comma.

1366,1366,2149,How does multitasking work,"I am completely clueless about the inner workings of an operating system, but I can more or less guess the approximate behaviour of many functions. One thing that I am not able to figure out, though, is multitasking.

In theory, the operating system manages time, according the CPU for small intervals to the various programs running. But it is not clear how this really works.

Say the operating system wants to start my program. The machine code is loaded somewhere in RAM, starting at a certain address. I guess then a jump should be performed to that address, allowing my code to execute. But in this way, the OS cannot regain control until I jump back.

Basically, I can imagine just two ways of making this work, but neither seems really suitable:


The operating system could read the machine instructions I want to perform and emulate them instead of executing them directly. I am intentionally vague, since I do not know how this would work, but it seems like it would slow down the program considerably.
Alternatively, the operating system could wait until I make a system call. In that moment it regains control and can check how long I have been running and do its timesharing stuff. This may work, but it seems unreliable, as I could make a long calculation which does not involve system calls and hang everything for a while.


So, it seems neither mechanism would work very well. How is multitasking actually performed?
",Andrea,https://programmers.stackexchange.com/users/15072,"It varies from system to system.

In nonpreemptive multitasking systems (such as the original Oberon, or the original Apple Macintosh), the operating system periodically ""polls"" all tasks, giving them an opportunity to do work.  The tasks are expected to play nicely together.  If they just have a little bit of work to do, they do it and return to the OS.  If one task has a BIG chunk to do, it is expected to break it into little pieces, and work one little piece each time it is polled.

Hardware interrupts (disk drive DMA completions, serial port interrupts, what have you) cause interrupt routines to run.  These interrupt routines may in turn notify tasks of work to be done when the task next runs.

In nonpreemptive multitasking systems, the occurrence or non-occurrence of an interrupt does not affect which task is running after the interrupt routine finishes.

In preemptive multitasking systems, it is possible for an interrupt routine to force a scheduling change.  In a traditional round-robin preemptive multitasking system, a periodic timer interrupt does exactly that.  The timer interrupt fires, the timer interrupt routine does some black magic to cause the return-from-interrupt instruction to return to the operating system's preemptive schedule, rather than to the running task, taking the processor away from the current task, and (POSSIBLY) giving it to another task.  If no other task is ready to run at that point, the current task will get the processor again, having only lost some time.

Preemptive multitasking can cause a LOT of troubles.  All of that annoying stuff about mutexes and critical sections and deadly embraces and ... show up when the processor gets taken away from you without warning.  You have to use all those things to tell the operating system that you are in the middle of mixing nitroglycerin and taking the processor away from you right now is likely to result in a large smoking virtual hole in the middle of the server room floor.

Is this possible? I looked under Image > Mode but nothing there seems to indiciate a binary style image.

I like using python and PIL, however.

604,604,946,Cyclic group of order $6$ defined by generators $a^2=b^3=a^{-1}b^{-1}ab=e$.,"
  The cyclic group of order $6$ is the group defined by the generators $a,b$ and relations $a^2=b^3=a^{-1}b^{-1}ab=e.$


For this problem I am assuming that it must be $a,b \neq e$. I will show the $a^ib^j$ are distinct for $i=0,1$ and $j=0,1,2$. If $i=0$, $b^0=e,b,b^2$ are distinct. We know order of $b$ is not $2$ as $b^3=e$ as the order of an element divides powers that make $b$ the identity, this would mean $2\mid 3$ a contradiction. For $i=1$,
$$ab^i=ab^k \rightarrow b^i=b^k \rightarrow i\equiv k \mod{3}$$
but as $0\leq i,k &lt; 3$, $i=k$ so $a,ab,ab^2$ are distinct.

So we have that $G \supseteq \{e,a,b,b^2,ab,ab^2\}.$ So
$$G=\left&lt;a,b\right&gt; =\{ a^{n_1}b^{n_2}\cdots a^{n_r}b^{n_{r+1}}\mid n_i \in \mathbb{Z}\}$$
and as $a^{-1}b^{-1}ab=e$, $ab=ba$ and so we can write $G$ as
$$G=\{a^nb^m \mid n,m \in \mathbb{Z}.$$
We then also have by $a^{-1}b^{-1}ab=e$ that
$$a^{-1}b=ba^{-1},\,a^{-1}b^{-1}=b^{-1}a^{-1},\,ab^{-1}=b^{-1}a$$
and so any
$$a^nb^m=a\cdots a\cdot b\cdots b =b^ma^n$$
as we can commute the elements to get $b^ma^n$ so $G$ is abelian. To show there are exactly $6$ elements, if we pick any $a^nb^m \in G$, we can assume that $0\leq n\leq 1$ and $0\leq m \leq 2$ and then this element is already accounted for above so
$$G=\{e,a,b,b^2,ab,ab^2\}.$$
As $G$ is a finite abelian group of order $6$, $G$ can be written uniquely up to permutation as a direct sum of $\mathbb{Z}_{p_i^{k_i}}$'s where the $p_i$ are prime but there is only one way to do this for $6=2\cdot3$ so this means
$$G\cong \mathbb{Z}_2\oplus\mathbb{Z}_3\cong\mathbb{Z}_6$$
as $\gcd(2,3)=1$.

I am just wondering of nicer ways to argue this in the case I would need to do this on an exam. Also if everything looks correct too.
",Frudrururu,https://math.stackexchange.com/users/43138,"Your arguments work just fine, but we can do a bit better.

Let's define $$G=\langle a,b\mid a^2=b^3=a^{-1}b^{-1}ab=e\rangle.$$

As you noted, $a^{-1}b^{-1}ab=e$ if and only if $ab=ba.$ Hence, $a$ and $b$ commute, and so since $G$ is generated by $a$ and $b,$ then it follows immediately that $G$ is an abelian group, and in particular $$G=\{a^mb^n\mid m,n\in\Bbb Z\}.$$ Since $a^2=e$ and $b^3=e,$ then we can conclude that $$G=\{e,a,b,ab,b^2,ab^2\}.$$

At this point, there are a few ways we can proceed:


Show that $e,a,b,ab,b^2,ab^2$ are distinct, then note that the abelian group of order $6$ is cyclic.
Show that $e,a,b,ab,b^2,ab^2$ are distinct, then apply Structure Theorem for Finite Abelian groups, as you did, together with the fact that $\gcd(2,3)=1,$ so that $G$ is cyclic.
Show that $e,a,b,ab,b^2,ab^2$ are distinct, then demonstrate an element of $G$ of order $6.$
Show that $H:=\langle a\rangle\cong\Bbb Z_2,$ $K:=\langle b\rangle\cong\Bbb Z_3,$ and that $H\cap K=\{e\},$ so since $H,K$ are normal subgroups of $G$ (since $G$ abelian) and $HK:=\{hk\mid h\in H,k\in K\}=G,$ then $G\cong H\times K.$ (Have you seen this result before?) Thus, $G\cong\Bbb Z_2\times\Bbb Z_3\cong\Bbb Z_6.$

2787,2787,4440,Fiona - Preffered method for defining a schema,"I'm fairly new to the world of python and GIS - so this is definitely a beginner question.

I am following Tom Macwrights small guide to Shapely and Fiona, and I noticed that even when opening the previously created shapefile, it doesn't contain the schema I defined using:

schema = { 
      'geometry': 'Point', 
      'properties': { 'name': 'str' } }


This is evident because when I try to call it using schema = input.schema.copy(), it spits out AttributeError: 'function' object has no attribute 'schema'

Reading the Fiona documentation, it states that:


  the schema of its record type (a vector file has a single type of record, remember) is accessed via a read-only schema attribute. 


Does that mean that it is not possible to store a schema in the shapefile,a nd therefore I'm always required set up the variables in the beginning, rather than reading from the file using input.schema.copy()? Or do I setup the schema using Records? 

If so, how do you read from a csv file (as in Tom's example) and place the data into the records to be read from input.schema.copy()? is it helpful to do this, or am I just complicating things and should define the schema every time i open the shapefile?

    for line in lines:
        # filling schema
        elem = {}
        # geometry with mapping function of shapely
        elem['geometry'] = mapping(line) 
        # attribute value (the same here)
        elem['properties'] = {'test': 145}
        # writing element in the file
        layer.write(elem)



Now we want to modify the schema of the original shapefile in a new shapefile:


1) Open the original shapefile:

shapefile =fiona.open('myshp.shp')
#read the schema
schema2 = shapefile.schema
print schema2
{'geometry': 'LineString', 'properties': OrderedDict([(u'test', 'int:10')])}


2) As it is a dictionary, it is easy to add new fields/keys in the properties:

schema2['properties']['string']='str'


3) Now we create a new shapefile copying myshp.shp with the new schema :

with fiona.open('myshp.shp', 'r') as input:
    schema = schema2
    # writing the new shapefile
    with fiona.open('myshp_copy.shp', 'w', 'ESRI Shapefile', schema) as output:
        for elem in input:
            # add the new attribute value
            elem['properties']['string']=""hello""
            output.write({'properties': elem['properties'],'geometry': mapping(shape(elem['geometry']))})



verification


c = fiona.open('myshp_copy.shp')
c.schema
{'geometry': 'LineString', 'properties': OrderedDict([(u'test', 'int:10'), (u'string', 'str')])}
# first element of the shapefile
c.next()
{'geometry': {'type': 'LineString', 'coordinates': [(272830.63, 155125.73000000001), (273770.32000000001, 155467.75)]}, 'type': 'Feature', 'id': '0', 'properties': OrderedDict([(u'test', 145), (u'string', u'hello')])}



Conclusion


If you don't want to modify the shapefile, it is easier with schema.copy() that is only used to get a copy of the original schema (no definition here)

with fiona.open('myshp.shp', 'r') as input:
    schema = input.schema.copy()
     with fiona.open('myshp_copy2.shp', 'w', 'ESRI Shapefile', schema) as output:
         for elem in input:
             output.write({'properties': elem['properties'],'geometry': mapping(shape(elem['geometry']))})

I am following Tom Macwrights small guide to Shapely and Fiona, and I noticed that even when opening the previously created shapefile, it doesn't contain the schema I defined using:

schema = { 
      'geometry': 'Point', 
      'properties': { 'name': 'str' } }


This is evident because when I try to call it using schema = input.schema.copy(), it spits out AttributeError: 'function' object has no attribute 'schema'

Reading the Fiona documentation, it states that:


  the schema of its record type (a vector file has a single type of record, remember) is accessed via a read-only schema attribute. 


Does that mean that it is not possible to store a schema in the shapefile,a nd therefore I'm always required set up the variables in the beginning, rather than reading from the file using input.schema.copy()? Or do I setup the schema using Records? 

If so, how do you read from a csv file (as in Tom's example) and place the data into the records to be read from input.schema.copy()? is it helpful to do this, or am I just complicating things and should define the schema every time i open the shapefile?

Thanks for the help - I'm really interested in developing my understanding of the processes occurring.
","I don't really understand your problem. Some explanations: for example, we want to


create a new shapefile
modify the original schema: for that, it's easier to just copy things to a new shapefile and make the changes as you copy


Create a new Polyline shapefile:



import fiona
# schema: it is a simple dictionary with geometry and properties as keys
schema = {'geometry': 'LineString','properties': {'test': 'int'}}
# for defining the geometry, you need Shapely
from shapely.geometry import LineString, mapping
# two simples geometries
lines = [LineString([(272830.63,155125.73),(273770.32,155467.75)]),LineString([(273536.47,155914.07),(272033.12,152265.71)])]
with fiona.open('myshp.shp', 'w', 'ESRI Shapefile', schema) as layer:
    for line in lines:
        # filling schema
        elem = {}
        # geometry with mapping function of shapely
        elem['geometry'] = mapping(line) 
        # attribute value (the same here)
        elem['properties'] = {'test': 145}
        # writing element in the file
        layer.write(elem)



Now we want to modify the schema of the original shapefile in a new shapefile:


1) Open the original shapefile:

shapefile =fiona.open('myshp.shp')
#read the schema
schema2 = shapefile.schema
print schema2
{'geometry': 'LineString', 'properties': OrderedDict([(u'test', 'int:10')])}


2) As it is a dictionary, it is easy to add new fields/keys in the properties:

schema2['properties']['string']='str'


3) Now we create a new shapefile copying myshp.shp with the new schema :

with fiona.open('myshp.shp', 'r') as input:
    schema = schema2
    # writing the new shapefile
    with fiona.open('myshp_copy.shp', 'w', 'ESRI Shapefile', schema) as output:
        for elem in input:
            # add the new attribute value
            elem['properties']['string']=""hello""
            output.write({'properties': elem['properties'],'geometry': mapping(shape(elem['geometry']))})

c = fiona.open('myshp_copy.shp')

My attack is a kind of black hat SEO known as ""hideMeYa"": http://siteolytics.com/black-hat-seo-technique-demystified/

Basically, the attacker slips a bunch of hidden links into the content so humans can't see them but google can. So they use unsuspecting sites to drum up back links to shady sites.

It's hard to say for sure how this was done, but in this site there were two known security vulnerabilities:


admin user was still in use (you should delete/rename the admin user).
Outdated plugins and core


In my case, the infected file was my theme's functions.php file. At the very top was this:

Notice how it's cleverly named to look like typical Wordpress stuff.

I'm not going to walk through all the code, but basically it's a bunch of base64_encodeed code as a reversed string. The strrev() makes it hard to find the two biggest red flags here: base64_encode and eval. The un-obfuscated code is included below, but here are my biggest takeaways (in addition to what Squish said):


Be on the look-out for eval and base64_decode, but also look for their reversed equivalents: lave and edoced_46esab
Also look for instances of strrev. There are few legitimate uses of all of these in the WP core which will return false positives, but not so many that you can't scrutinize each one.
In my case, the hack doesn't appear for logged in users (It checks client's cookies), so don't let that throw you off. It's a clever twist to confuse the users who are most likely to be looking for it.    


Good night and good luck.

","I won't repeat any of the good advice in Squish's answer. You should also read this article on Wordpress security. I'm just going to cover the specifics of what I learned from my episode.

My attack is a kind of black hat SEO known as ""hideMeYa"": http://siteolytics.com/black-hat-seo-technique-demystified/

Basically, the attacker slips a bunch of hidden links into the content so humans can't see them but google can. So they use unsuspecting sites to drum up back links to shady sites.

It's hard to say for sure how this was done, but in this site there were two known security vulnerabilities:


admin user was still in use (you should delete/rename the admin user).
Outdated plugins and core


In my case, the infected file was my theme's functions.php file. At the very top was this:

Notice how it's cleverly named to look like typical Wordpress stuff.

I'm not going to walk through all the code, but basically it's a bunch of base64_encodeed code as a reversed string. The strrev() makes it hard to find the two biggest red flags here: base64_encode and eval. The un-obfuscated code is included below, but here are my biggest takeaways (in addition to what Squish said):


Be on the look-out for eval and base64_decode, but also look for their reversed equivalents: lave and edoced_46esab
Also look for instances of strrev. There are few legitimate uses of all of these in the WP core which will return false positives, but not so many that you can't scrutinize each one.
In my case, the hack doesn't appear for logged in users (It checks client's cookies), so don't let that throw you off. It's a clever twist to confuse the users who are most likely to be looking for it.    


Good night and good luck.

i have updated server2 and patched it. I have also joined the domain as member server and set up the raid structure. I have also moved the data over to the right spot. BUT here is what i am not 100% sure on.

The company wants to keep the old name of ""server"", i did not want to do that and was thinking of just making a cname alias in AD DNS forward lookup zone to point to the new ip address of server2 but you can reference it as server. In order to do the alias i would naturally remove or rename the old server or just unjoin it from the domain altogether.

I have read that you can just rename a computer to a previous name in AD as long as you have unjoined and removed it from the appropirate list under Active Directory? Can i just rename a server that is a member server in a domain? Do i have to change the sid or run newsid?

Just looking for some best practices.

6071,6071,9636,Throwing a ball upwards in an accelerating train,"If I throw a ball upwards to a certain height in an accelerating train, will it end up in my hand? At the moment I release the ball, it will have a velocity equal to that of the train at that instant. But because the train is accelerating, the train will have a greater velocity and thus the ball will travel lesser distance and should fall behind me. Is my reasoning correct?
",user34304,https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/34304,"User Sahil Chadha has already answered the question, but here's the math and a pretty picture for anyone who is unconvinced that you're right.

Since the train is accelerating, from the perspective of an observer on the train, the ball will experience a (fictitious) force in the direction opposite the train's travel having magnitude $ma$ where $m$ is the mass of the ball and $a$ is the magnitude of the acceleration of the train.  If we call the direction of travel the positive $x$-direction, and if we call the ""up"" direction the positive $y$-direction, then the equations of motion in the $x$- and $y$-directions will therefore be as follows:
\begin{align}
  \ddot x &amp;= -a \\ 
  \ddot y &amp;= -g.
\end{align}
The general solution is
\begin{align}
  x(t) &amp;= x_0 + v_{x,0} t - \frac{1}{2}a t^2 \\
  y(t) &amp;= y_0 + v_{y,0} t - \frac{1}{2}g t^2
\end{align}
Now, let's say that the origin of our coordinate system lies at the point from which the ball is thrown so that $x_0 = y_0 = 0$ and that the ball is thrown up at time $t=0$ with velocity $v_{y,0} = v$ and $v_{x,0} = 0$ in the positive $y$-direction, then the solutions becomes
\begin{align}
  x(t) &amp;= -\frac{1}{2}a t^2\\
  y(t) &amp;= vt - \frac{1}{2} gt^2
\end{align}
So what does this trajectory look like?  By solving the first equation for $t$, and plugging this back into the equation for $y$, we obtain the following expression for the $y$ coordinate of the particle as a function of its $x$ coordinate along the trajectory:
\begin{align}
  y(x) = v\sqrt{-\frac{2x}{a}} +\frac{g}{a} x
\end{align}
Here's a Mathematica plot of what this trajectory looks like for $v = 1.0\,\mathrm m/\mathrm s$ and the list $a = 9.8,5.0,2.5,1,0.1\,\mathrm m/\mathrm s^2$ of values for the train's acceleration



From the point of view of someone on the train, the ball flies backward in a sort of deformed parabola, but the smaller the acceleration is, the more it simply looks as it would if you were to throw a ball vertically in an un-accelerated train.

  y(x) = v\sqrt{-\frac{2x}{a}} +\frac{g}{a} x
\end{align}
Here's a Mathematica plot of what this trajectory looks like for $v = 1.0\,\mathrm m/\mathrm s$ and the list $a = 9.8,5.0,2.5,1,0.1\,\mathrm m/\mathrm s^2$ of values for the train's acceleration



From the point of view of someone on the train, the ball flies backward in a sort of deformed parabola, but the smaller the acceleration is, the more it simply looks as it would if you were to throw a ball vertically in an un-accelerated train.

Now I don't need to add all these. I just want customers to view the product details and check out.","Amasty give a good idea.But if you want checkout all type of Product using checkout

Then follow below steps:

step1: make shipping same as billing address.

Step2:On Billing save action programmatically set free shipping as shipping method.

may like:

add below code which set shipping method on checkout after $this-&gt;getOnepage()-&gt;saveBilling($data, $customerAddressId);

$this-&gt;getOnepage()-&gt;getQuote()-&gt;getShippingAddress()-&gt;setShippingMethod($shippingMethod);
 $this-&gt;getOnepage()-&gt;getQuote()-&gt;collectTotals()-&gt;save();


Step3: Also on billing save action programmatically  save Zero Subtotal payment as  payment or any available payment gateway. exmaple:

$quote=$this-&gt;getOnepage()-&gt;getQuote()
        $paymentData = $this-&gt;_preparePaymentData($paymentData);
        if ($quote-&gt;isVirtual()) {
            $quote-&gt;getBillingAddress()-&gt;setPaymentMethod('free');
        } else {
            // check if shipping address is set
            if (is_null($quote-&gt;getShippingAddress()-&gt;getId())) {
               // error
            }
            $quote-&gt;getShippingAddress()-&gt;setPaymentMethod(
                isset($paymentData['method']) ? $paymentData['method'] : null
            );
        }

        if (!$quote-&gt;isVirtual() &amp;&amp; $quote-&gt;getShippingAddress()) {
            $quote-&gt;getShippingAddress()-&gt;setCollectShippingRates(true);
        }

        $total = $quote-&gt;getBaseSubtotal();
        try {
            $payment = $quote-&gt;getPayment();
            $payment-&gt;importData(array('method' =&gt; 'free'));
            $quote-&gt;setTotalsCollectedFlag(false)
                -&gt;collectTotals()
                -&gt;save();
        } catch (Mage_Core_Exception $e) {

        }


Step4: Goto review step using json return like:

try {

            // get section and redirect data
            $redirectUrl = $this-&gt;getOnepage()-&gt;getQuote()-&gt;getPayment()-&gt;getCheckoutRedirectUrl();
            if (empty($result['error']) &amp;&amp; !$redirectUrl) {

3294,3294,5254,How can I tell if a downloaded ISO is complete?,"I just ran into a nasty problem with an ISO download from Microsoft.  I successfully burnt it to a rewritable DVD, and copied the contents to the local hard drive on another machine, but when I went to run them they were corrupt.  It turns out the download had been truncated.

Now, OK, sometimes that happens - but it surprised me that the truncated file (which was only slightly more than 60% of the actual ISO) burnt successfully and seemed to be presenting me with a sensible file system, to the extent that I could (apparently) successfully copy the files.

So, is there some way I could have tested the file to see if it was complete or not?  The MS web site did not provide any information about the expected size, so I'm looking for a generic solution: given an ISO file which may or may not be truncated, is there some way to tell?  Do commonly used CD/DVD (data) formats include any embedded information about how much data is supposed to be on the disk, or even better, some kind of CRC?

A solution that detects most truncated images will be accepted, it doesn't need to be perfect.  (I'd prefer something that doesn't give false positives, though.)

[Addendum: a comparison of the disk burnt with the truncated image with the files extracted from the full image suggests that chunks of the data from many of the files were replaced with random information, perhaps from the contents of a previous burn to the same rewritable disk.]
",Harry Johnston,https://superuser.com/users/96662,"If the source did not provide any checksums for you, you should first check the file size and see if it matches. If not, it means that your download is ended prematurely. 

Also in linux, you can use wget, with -c command to continue aborted downloads. I have never tried to continue a download started from another application (mostly browser) but I think it should be fine.

I always use wget as a download manager as it fails rarely and allows continuing aborted downloads. One should have a download manager in their tools for downloading large files consistently even though one does not use it every day.

3391,3391,5407,Alto singing Tenor,"I am currently musically directing a community theater production of Sweeney Todd.  

We have cast a female to play the part of Toby, and in the song ""Not While I'm Around"", she is not able to achieve sufficient volume on the opening notes of the number.  

The song starts on an Eb, moves to F, then Eb, Ab, and Bb.  She has a great tenor timber to her voice, and once she gets up to the Ab, she sounds great.  We have 16 days until the show opens, and my question is twofold.  

First, are there any good exercises that a singer can do in order to improve the volume on the low end of their range?  

Second, if it comes close to performance time, what does music theory have to say about these two choices: 


changing the melody to something like Ab, Gb, Ab, Ab, Bb, or 
having her begin the song an octave higher, and then on the third line of the song change back to the original octave?  


I personally do not like how the second choice sounds, as it seems to bring about a very drastic change, but I am wondering if there is precedence for something like this, or if conventional musical theory has anything to say.

Here is the first two bars, which is repeated in the next two bars:

",Michael Blaustein,https://music.stackexchange.com/users/765,"Not knowing the song, but assuming the beginning is too low, and the key changes are all upwards, which is usual, I'd start in maybe the 2nd key, and either lose a key change, or go up another time, if the duetter can cope.

Changing key for a song is, as jjmusicnotes points out, very common - I did it all the while when playing for choirs, often to get a better sound from them, instead of having them screaming at the top of their range, or grunting in their boots.

Seeing the total song may give other options. The above options may also not be good for accompanying musicians.

Since the start comes straight after some narrative (I'm guessing), the easiest would be to speak the first bit, before bursting into song, maybe on the second or third line.

I am NOT an XML guy so I have no clue how to tell you to extract that information dynamically. (More on this below.)

I can't see any way to determine whether isolation has been set (at the batch level or using things like WITH (NOLOCK)) - you might have to:


capture those in the act by polling sys.dm_exec_requests (though transaction_isolation_level really only tells you about things like SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL, not table-level hints, since you can apply NOLOCK only to some tables in the query), or
rely on parsing of the query text itself from sys.dm_exec_sql_text (noting that this can yield false positives if, say, NOLOCK is commented out, or you have a table name like dbo.SubmitNoLocks). 


I also can't see any difference in the plan for query hints like OPTION (FORCE ORDER) or OPTION (FAST n), so likewise these may also need to rely on parsing the query text as opposed to relying on the plan XML.

EDIT

Since you can get a non-XML version of the plan from an alternate DMF, sys.dm_exec_text_query_plan, you don't necessarily have to become an XML guru to perform this parsing. For example, the following will capture all query plans in the cache that used WITH (INDEX...), WITH FORCESEEK[(...)], WITH FORCESCAN, WITH (NOEXPAND) or WITH (NOLOCK):

SELECT t.[text]--, qp.query_plan 
FROM sys.dm_exec_cached_plans AS p
CROSS APPLY sys.dm_exec_sql_text(p.plan_handle) AS t
CROSS APPLY sys.dm_exec_text_query_plan(p.plan_handle, 0, -1) AS qp
WHERE 
 t.[text] NOT LIKE '%dm_exec%' -- to keep this query out of result
 AND
 (
  qp.query_plan LIKE '%ForceSeek=""1""%'
  OR qp.query_plan LIKE '%Forcescan=""1""%'
  OR qp.query_plan LIKE '%NoExpandHint=""1""%'
  OR qp.query_plan LIKE '%ForcedIndex=""1""%'
  OR t.[text] LIKE '%NOLOCK%'
 )
 -- t.[dbid] = DB_ID() -- to limit results, but may be too exclusionary
;


As identified earlier, this could produce false positives for queries like this:

SELECT * FROM dbo.table /* WITH (NOLOCK) */
SELECT * FROM dbo.RenoLocksmiths;


But outside of parsing the query text for NOLOCK, for all the plan attributes - since the XML gets entitized and characters like quotes get escaped - it will not return false positives for queries like this:

SELECT * FROM dbo.table /* Forceseek=""1"" */
SELECT * FROM dbo.[WITH (FORCESEEK)];

I am NOT an XML guy so I have no clue how to tell you to extract that information dynamically. (More on this below.)

I can't see any way to determine whether isolation has been set (at the batch level or using things like WITH (NOLOCK)) - you might have to:


capture those in the act by polling sys.dm_exec_requests (though transaction_isolation_level really only tells you about things like SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL, not table-level hints, since you can apply NOLOCK only to some tables in the query), or
rely on parsing of the query text itself from sys.dm_exec_sql_text (noting that this can yield false positives if, say, NOLOCK is commented out, or you have a table name like dbo.SubmitNoLocks). 


I also can't see any difference in the plan for query hints like OPTION (FORCE ORDER) or OPTION (FAST n), so likewise these may also need to rely on parsing the query text as opposed to relying on the plan XML.

EDIT

Since you can get a non-XML version of the plan from an alternate DMF, sys.dm_exec_text_query_plan, you don't necessarily have to become an XML guru to perform this parsing. For example, the following will capture all query plans in the cache that used WITH (INDEX...), WITH FORCESEEK[(...)], WITH FORCESCAN, WITH (NOEXPAND) or WITH (NOLOCK):

SELECT t.[text]--, qp.query_plan 
FROM sys.dm_exec_cached_plans AS p
CROSS APPLY sys.dm_exec_sql_text(p.plan_handle) AS t
CROSS APPLY sys.dm_exec_text_query_plan(p.plan_handle, 0, -1) AS qp
WHERE 
 t.[text] NOT LIKE '%dm_exec%' -- to keep this query out of result
 AND
 (
  qp.query_plan LIKE '%ForceSeek=""1""%'
  OR qp.query_plan LIKE '%Forcescan=""1""%'
  OR qp.query_plan LIKE '%NoExpandHint=""1""%'
  OR qp.query_plan LIKE '%ForcedIndex=""1""%'
  OR t.[text] LIKE '%NOLOCK%'
 )
 -- t.[dbid] = DB_ID() -- to limit results, but may be too exclusionary
;


As identified earlier, this could produce false positives for queries like this:

SELECT * FROM dbo.table /* WITH (NOLOCK) */
SELECT * FROM dbo.RenoLocksmiths;


But outside of parsing the query text for NOLOCK, for all the plan attributes - since the XML gets entitized and characters like quotes get escaped - it will not return false positives for queries like this:

SELECT * FROM dbo.table /* Forceseek=""1"" */
SELECT * FROM dbo.[WITH (FORCESEEK)];

If not, was there an explicit in-universe explanation as to why the Force was never used to enhance Hyperspace travel? (the predictable ""well the Rakata were screwed up via their use of Dark Side"" doesn't seem to be plausible in a universe full of Sith, and assorted other Dark Force users).
",DVK-on-Ahch-To,https://scifi.stackexchange.com/users/976,"Around 200 years after the fall of the Rakata's Empire (the Infinite Empire) the civilizations from both the planets Correllia and Duro managed to build workarounds using the Rakata's force-based technology, making it common use in around twenty years or so. Even the Tionese managed to build a really basic form of hyperspace technology around the Rakata's force-only requirement. As for a reason why force sensitive hyperdrive was not further looked into, a huge problem the Rakata's had was because the hyperdrive relied on the use of the force, they could only travel to planets with high-force signatures, allowing other civilizations to take control of the planets in between. Hope this helps!

","About 200 years after the collapse of the lakata Empire (infinite Empire), the civilizations of the planets Corellia and Dulo managed to use lakata's force based technology to build solutions that would be widely used for about 20 years. Even the tonians managed to build a truly basic hyperspace around the needs of lakata's forces. As for why force sensitive superluminal speed has not been further studied, one of lakata's big problems is that superluminal speed depends on the use of force, and they can only go to planets with high force characteristics, so as to allow other civilizations to control the planets between the two planets.

1063,1063,1673,How does multitasking work,"I am completely clueless about the inner workings of an operating system, but I can more or less guess the approximate behaviour of many functions. One thing that I am not able to figure out, though, is multitasking.

In theory, the operating system manages time, according the CPU for small intervals to the various programs running. But it is not clear how this really works.

Say the operating system wants to start my program. The machine code is loaded somewhere in RAM, starting at a certain address. I guess then a jump should be performed to that address, allowing my code to execute. But in this way, the OS cannot regain control until I jump back.

Basically, I can imagine just two ways of making this work, but neither seems really suitable:


The operating system could read the machine instructions I want to perform and emulate them instead of executing them directly. I am intentionally vague, since I do not know how this would work, but it seems like it would slow down the program considerably.
Alternatively, the operating system could wait until I make a system call. In that moment it regains control and can check how long I have been running and do its timesharing stuff. This may work, but it seems unreliable, as I could make a long calculation which does not involve system calls and hang everything for a while.


So, it seems neither mechanism would work very well. How is multitasking actually performed?
",Andrea,https://programmers.stackexchange.com/users/15072,"The OS programs a timer to kick in every few microseconds (or milliseconds, depending on system speed). This timer raises the hardware interrupt, which causes the CPU to stop whatever it is currently doing, dump all its contents onto the stack and process the interrupt routine indicated by the address provided by the interrupt controller. This routine can inspect the stack and various other variables to make a decision which running process should next be put back into action. If it's the same process, the interrupt routine simply returns. If it's a different one, the relevant parts of the stack are saved and then replaced  with the contents of a previously interrupted process, so when the interrupt routine returns, that process continues. Other than the fact that some time has elapsed, that process is unaware of having been interrupted and/or paused for some time.

This is (for modern CPUs) a VERY VERY simplified version of what happens, but it explains the principle. In addition to these OS controlled interrupts, there are also interrupts caused by external events (mouse, keyboard, serial ports, network ports, etc.) which are process with separate interrupt routines, which are usually connected to event handlers.

Very often process/task/context switching is also based on availability of external resources. Typically a process that requires data from storage (i.e. not in RAM) will place the request on a queue, set an event handler for the hardware interrupt indicating that the request has been served and then relinquish control to the task scheduler (since there is no point in waiting). Again, a very simplified description of what actually goes on, but it should serve the purposes of this answer.

2966,2966,4720,How do I keep drawer knobs from loosening over time?,"I see knobs like this on cabinets, dressers, and closet doors. They are held in place with a single wood screw.


Very often they are loose. I guess when we grab them we often impart a slight twist. Also, temperature and humidity changes cause the wood to swell and shrink. The system is biased towards unscrewing, so over time they loosen up.

My DIY instinct says that this is bad. That the screw will strip out the knob, or it will ream out the hole in the door. Well, it seems sloppy.

When I notice one, I give it a twist to tighten. Sometimes I put my finger over the screw head to hold it still. When it's really stiff, I might get out the multitool. Sometimes, in my enthusiasm, I strip out the knob. Doh!

What's the best way to deal with these things? For example:


Use handles that take two screws.
Put a washer under the head to distribute the load, then make them really tight.
Keep them all tight according to a schedule.
Only use knobs made of strong wood, and keep them tight.
Use knobs that take a machine screw instead of a wood screw.
Put wood glue in the screw hole.
Use door designs that don't need a handle.

410,410,636,"""God is Fire"": Trying to Source an Analogy for Prayer","I remember reading once a very clever analogy, which I was sure that I had found in the writings of Yeshayahu Leibowitz (who sourced it, from memory, in the writings of the Rav, R' Yosef Ber Soloveitchik, who himself sourced it in the Rambam), but I can no longer locate it at all. In essence, the analogy stated that God is like fire. Different objects, when dropped into the fire, react differently. Some become hard. Some become soft. Some let off smoke. Some change their hue. Some make a noise. Some might explode. But while all of these different reactions can be found, at no stage is the fire anything other than a fire; the difference in responses to it is to be found in the different objects that come into contact with it.

So too, the analogy concluded, when it comes to our relationship with God. When we pray, we change ourselves in order that God might interact more favourably with us. We do not hope for God to change in any way, but for ourselves to change instead. God's influence upon the world is constant and unchanging; it is we who are in flux.

Does this analogy sound familiar to anybody? If you can direct me to a printed source (be it in the writings of the Rav, or Prof. Leibowitz, or whomever it was who came up with this), I would be much obliged.
",Shimon bM,https://judaism.stackexchange.com/users/1659,"From zaq's answer to a related question:


  In the Moreh Nevuchim [(Part 1 ch.53)], Rambam explains how God's attributes should be understood without compromising God's unchangingness.
  
  He compares God's mood to a fire. If you put ice in a fire, it melts, then evaporates. If you put clay in a fire, it hardens. If you put wood in a fire it burns... The fire causes many different and contrasting effects without changing the fire's properties. The same ""fire melts certain things and makes others hard, it boils and burns, it bleaches and blackens."" It is the properties of each individual material that elicit a different interactions with fire.

6061,6061,9618,How should I create sitemap of a site which goes live with thousands of pages?,"We are working on an education site and have custom website built on wordpress. 
One component of site is blog posts and pages, sitemap for which gets built by sitemap plugin every night. 

Another component is the college pages and we went live with this section 2 month back. To build the sitemap for these 8000+ pages , we wrote a program and created a sitemap lets say abc.xml.
Then we submitted the sitemap to google.

After 2 months, I can see that the google acknowledged the submission but never indexed these 8000+ pages.

561 indexed pages are from our blog post and pages.



I guess the mistakes we did was that we created the sitemap of 8000+ links and submitted when we should have done it in piecemeal basis.
2nd mistake I guess is that we do not update the abc.xml sitemap regularly which we thought of doing once all the pages were indexed.

What is suggested

a) to fix this problem

b) and how to get the pages indexed ?
",vsingh,https://webmasters.stackexchange.com/users/1414,"To answer your question very specifically. Google prefers to index smaller sites and submitting a sitemap, while advisable for a site your size, may actually go largely ignored. Yes Google has read it. And yes Google is indexing pages, but I would surmise that Google is opting for indexing your site by following links more than the site map.

One site I submitted a sitemap for was fully indexed while the sitemap was hardly touched according to Google Webmaster Tools. This should not be a concern.

As well, any site can really take a while to get indexed especially any new site. Google is very good about discovering new sites and spidering them, however, any new site remains at the end of the fetch queue consistently up and until the site is well settled into the index and Google begins revisiting the site. Simply put, any new site will be at the end of the line for a while.

If your site is relatively new, it will likely take a while longer to get all of your pages in Google. You will see Google go in fits and spirts and it will frustrate the h311 out of you! Just be cool for a while. It will all work out for you just fine.

Of course, now you don't have the specific record you're looking for when the event fires. You can use the Find and FindNext methods to filter the entire recordset down to what you need in the event procedure.

Of course, this is if I can't talk you into switching to ADODB for your purposes here. It supports parameterized queries, which (in theory) should execute a bit faster. This is because, to the best of my knowledge, DAO requests all of the data and then filters it down in memory on the local machine. An ADODB parameterized query allows for the plan to be cached and only returns the results of the statement.

Dim cmd as ADODB.Command

Set rst = cmd.Execute

' some code to set february's value


Note how we simply pass the query a new value, instead of duplicating all of the query text? This is just one of ADODB's benefits.



One other, rather minor note.

I bet this code is all through your code base.

If i change the Argument type: to term id's seprated by ....+ etc i do get a return but it only shows links for one of the terms.

3509,3509,5598,Timings of Mana Costs vs Mana Payments,"If I have 7 lands and a Wild Cantor (or another creature that sacrifices to produce mana, e.g. an Eldrazi Spawn token) in play, and there are no other creatures on the battlefield, can I cast Blasphemous Act?  

I seem to have hazy memories that a Wild Cantor didn't interact particularly well with cards with Convoke, so I was wondering if it was a similar story here...
",thesunneversets,https://boardgames.stackexchange.com/users/436,"From my interpretation, it should work.


  601 Casting Spells
  
  601.2e The player determines the total cost of the spell. Usually this is just the mana cost. Some spells have additional or alternative costs. Some effects may increase or reduce the cost to pay, or may provide other alternative costs. Costs may include paying mana, tapping permanents, sacrificing permanents, discarding cards, and so on. The total cost is the mana cost or alternative cost (as determined in rule 601.2b), plus all additional costs and cost increases, and minus all cost reductions. If the mana component of the total cost is reduced to nothing by cost reduction effects, it is considered to be {0}. It can't be reduced to less than {0}. Once the total cost is determined, any effects that directly affect the total cost are applied. Then the resulting total cost becomes ""locked in."" If effects would change the total cost after this time, they have no effect.
  
  601.2f If the total cost includes a mana payment, the player then has a chance to activate mana abilities (see rule 605, ""Mana Abilities""). Mana abilities must be activated before costs are paid.
  
  Example: You cast Altar's Reap, which costs {1}{B} and has an additional cost of sacrificing a creature. You sacrifice Thunderscape Familiar, whose effect makes your black spells cost {1} less to cast. Because a spell's total cost is ""locked in"" before payments are actually made, you pay {B}, not {1}{B}, even though you're sacrificing the Familiar.


So first you determine and lock the mana cost, then you can activate mana abilities, then you have to pay the mana cost.

As for the definition of a Mana Ability:


  
  Mana Abilities
  
  
  605.1a An activated ability is a mana ability if it meets three criteria: it doesn't have a target, it could put mana into a player's mana pool when it resolves, and it's not a loyalty ability. (See rule 606, ""Loyalty Abilities."")


The cantor meets all 3 criteria, so its ability is a mana ability. Therefore, you should gain both the cost reduction and the mana through saccing.

As for why a cantor should not play nicely with Convoke, I don't know - do you have an authoritative source that it really doesn't work? ""Tapping a creature"" is an optional, additional cost by Convoke, and after tapping for convoke you should still be able to sac the Cantor with its mana ability.

Here is an explanation why the cantor can only reduce convoke spells by 1. However, that does not affect my answer to your actual question. The subtle difference between the two is that Blasphemous Act has a cost reduction, which is locked after you determined it. Convoke, OTOH, offers an alternative way of paying the mana costs and requires you to tap creatures to pay for its cost. You can announce to tap the cantor, but once you sacced it for mana, you can of course no longer do so, and the game rewinds to before you announced Blasphemous Act.

1139,1139,1785,Euclid's Algorithm (Greatest Common Divisor),"According to Donald Knuth in ""The Art Of Computer Programming"", the following is how to find the greatest common divisor of two positive numbers, m and n, using Euclid's Algorithm.


  
  Divide m by n and let r be the remainder.
  If r is 0, n is the answer; if r is not 0, continue to step 3.
  Set m = n and n = r. Go back to step 1.
  


Below is my implementation of this algorithm.

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int greatestCommonDivisor(int m, int n)
{
    int r;

    /* Check For Proper Input */
    if((m == 0) || (n == 0))
        return 0;
    else if((m &lt; 0) || (n &lt; 0))
        return -1;

    do
    {
        r = m % n;
        if(r == 0)
            break;
        m = n;
        n = r;
    }
    while(true);

    return n;
}

    printf(""The GCD of %d and %d is %d\n"", num1, num2, gcd);

    getchar();
    return 0;
}


Though it appears to work just fine, it doesn't seem to be as elegant as I'd like, especially in the do-while loop.  Also, the while(true) seems dangerous, though I'm pretty confident that r will be reduced to 0 eventually and we'll break out of the loop.

Do you have any suggestions on either making the code more elegant or robust?
",Fiddling Bits,https://codereview.stackexchange.com/users/33159,"Firstly, your implementation is (arguably) not quite correct:

The GCD of two negative numbers is perfectly well defined. However, if you really don't want the user to pass in negative numbers, make it explicit in the function signature:

Euclid's algorithm is one of the most basic examples of where recursion shines:

unsigned greatestCommonDivisor(unsigned m, unsigned n)
{
    if(n == 0) return m;
    return greatestCommonDivisor(n, m % n);

We first check the base case, which is 2: If r is 0, n is the answer; if r is not 0, continue to step 3. The recursive call actually combines steps 1 and 3 here: m % n sets n to be the remainder r, and we call the function again with n = m.

As a final note, a lot of people avoid recursive functions in C/C++ because most compilers don't optimise tail-calls to use constant stack space. However, Euclid's algorithm will perform only O(log N) steps, hence it's easy to see on any computer with (reasonable) stack size, this won't cause a stack overflow for numbers whose size is constrained by int or unsigned.

3383,3383,5393,Unity: Rolling a ball around a spherical planet with forces,"I'm trying to make a game in Unity where the player character is a ball (a sphere), and the game world is a planet (a very large sphere) that the ball can roll around on. The ball can be rolled in any direction, via the arrow keys. If the player holds the right arrow, the ball should roll smoothly to the right, all the way around the planet not leaving the ground, until it eventually reaches back to where it started. The camera follows the ball third person such that the ball always appears in the same position in the screen and the planet appears to be moving underneath it.

My question is, how can I use rigidbody.AddForce() to roll the ball in the way described above? What I think I need to do is to take the vector I get from taking the input values on the horizontal and vertical axes:

float moveX = Input.GetAxis (""Horizontal"");
float moveY = Input.GetAxis (""Vertical"");

Vector3 inputMovement = new Vector3 (moveX, 0.0f, moveY);


And rotate it somehow, so that I'm applying that vector as force to the ball but in the direction that's tangential to the point on the planet that the ball is currently on, and then apply it as force to the ball's rigidbody. So if you're looking at the planet head on, and the ball is at 3 o'clock, pressing the right arrow key should apply the force directly downwards.

Can anyone help me out here? I think it's probably really simple but I'm having trouble figuring it out exactly.

",Searcher,https://academia.stackexchange.com/users/35322,"If I'm understanding correctly, the problem you're concerned about is what to do when you've just submitted a paper, and now you have a long wait before you can submit the follow-up paper.

I think that is a bad assumption.  There is no reason that you need to be stalled on your forward progress just because a paper is under review.  Here are two good alternatives that work within the system.


You can continue directly building on the same direction.  If you get to a major milestone and are ready to submit a new paper before the previous one is finished reviewing, you can submit a paper citing the one under review as ""submitted,"" and include the draft paper as supplementary review-only information.

Why not take a secondary path that you've wanted to investigate but isn't in the same exactly line of progression as the paper currently under review?  That will likely lead to its own interesting results that can be published without dependency on the paper currently under review.


It also seems possible to me that this concern may have arisen due to trying to publish too incrementally.  If you cluster your work into larger ""publication units"" the time lag will likely be less problematic and a smaller number of significant papers is generally better for your career than a bunch of little incremental papers that nobody cares about.

1419,1419,2228,Prove that any real function defined on a real open interval has at most countably many simple discontinuities.,"This is problem 17 in baby Rudin's chapter on continuity. He has a hint to use triplets of rationals that bound each simple discontinuity on the left, right, and in between the values of the limits from the left and right. It seems like this can be weakened to just rationals to the left and right. 

Simple discontinuities are those in which the limit from the left and right exist, so there must be intervals to the left and right of a simple continuity on which no other simple discontinuity can exist. More precisely, let $c$ and $c'$ be simple discontinuities for $f$ on $(a,b)$ and consider the limit, $l$, of $f$ approaching $c$ from the left:

$\forall \epsilon &gt;0, \exists \delta&gt;0 : c-x&lt;\delta \Rightarrow |l-f(x)|&lt;\epsilon$

but $ \exists \epsilon '&gt;0 \forall \delta ' &gt;0 : |c'-x|&lt;\delta ' \Rightarrow |f(c')-f(x)|&gt;\epsilon '
\\ \therefore \epsilon = \epsilon ' , \delta ' = \delta \rightarrow \leftarrow
$

Therefore, you can make an injection from the set of simple discontinuities to a subset of rationals by associating each simple discontinuity with one rational in the aforementioned ""free"" interval to its left; from there compose with the map from rationals to integers to show countable. Is this argument correct?
",user2303321,https://math.stackexchange.com/users/84960,"Let $E_n = \left\{ x \in \left( a , b \right) \mid \lvert \lim_{t \to x^+} f(t) -

Then $E_1 \subset E_2 \subset\cdots$ and $\cup^\infty_{i=1} E_i$ is the set of all simple discontinuities. If all of the $E_n$ are countable, then $\cup^\infty_{i=1}E_i$ is countable.

Suppose $ x \in E_n $.

The left-hand limit exists, so

$$

Suppose $y \in \left( x - \delta^-_x, x \right)$ is a simple discontinuity. Then

$$
\exists \delta^-_y &gt; 0 \colon t \in ( y - \delta^-_y, y ) \implies \lvert f(t) - \lim_{t \to y^-} f(t) \rvert &lt; \frac{1}{4n} \\
\exists \delta^+_y &gt; 0 \colon t \in ( y, y + \delta^+_y ) \implies \lvert f(t) - \lim_{t \to y^+} f(t) \rvert &lt; \frac{1}{4n}
$$

Then $\exists z^- \in (y - \delta^-_y, y) \cap (x - \delta^-_x, x), z^+ \in (y, y + \delta^+_y) \cap (x - \delta^-_x, x) \colon$

$$
\lvert \lim_{t \to y^+} f(t) - \lim_{t \to y^-} f(t) \rvert \leq \\
\lvert \lim_{t \to y^+} f(t) - \lim_{t \to x^-} f(t) \rvert + \lvert \lim_{t \to y^-} f(t) - \lim_{t \to x^-} f(t) \rvert \leq \\
\lvert \lim_{t \to y^+} f(t) - f(z^+) \rvert + \lvert \lim_{t \to x^-} f(t) - f(z^+) \rvert + \lvert \lim_{t \to y^-} f(t) - f(z^-) \rvert + \lvert \lim_{t \to x^-} f(t) - f(z^-) \rvert \leq \\
\frac{1}{n}
$$

So that 

$$
\forall x \in E_n \exists \delta &gt; 0 \colon y \in (x - \delta, x )  \implies y \not \in E_n
$$

This says that for a jump at $x$, there exists a left-hand neighborhood around x such that the jumps in the neighborhood are smaller than the jump at $x$ (we could prove the same thing for a right-hand neighborhood, but that turns out to be unnecessary). For each $x$, choose a rational number $q \in \mathbb{Q}$ from $(x - \delta, x )$, e.g., 

$$
\frac{ \lceil (x - \delta) ( \lceil \frac{1}{\delta} \rceil + 1 ) \rceil + 1}{\lceil \frac{1}{\delta} \rceil + 1}
$$

Since the $(x - \delta, x)$ are disjoint, $g \colon x \mapsto q$ is an injection $g \colon E_n \rightarrowtail \mathbb{Q}$ (each $x$ maps to a different $q$). Since $\mathbb{Q}$ is countable, so is $E_n$.

He has a hint to use triplets of rationals that bound each simple discontinuity on the left, right, and in between the values of the limits from the left and right. It seems like this can be weakened to just rationals to the left and right. 

Simple discontinuities are those in which the limit from the left and right exist, so there must be intervals to the left and right of a simple continuity on which no other simple discontinuity can exist. More precisely, let $c$ and $c'$ be simple discontinuities for $f$ on $(a,b)$ and consider the limit, $l$, of $f$ approaching $c$ from the left:

$\forall \epsilon &gt;0, \exists \delta&gt;0 : c-x&lt;\delta \Rightarrow |l-f(x)|&lt;\epsilon$

but $ \exists \epsilon '&gt;0 \forall \delta ' &gt;0 : |c'-x|&lt;\delta ' \Rightarrow |f(c')-f(x)|&gt;\epsilon '
\\ \therefore \epsilon = \epsilon ' , \delta ' = \delta \rightarrow \leftarrow
$

Therefore, you can make an injection from the set of simple discontinuities to a subset of rationals by associating each simple discontinuity with one rational in the aforementioned ""free"" interval to its left; from there compose with the map from rationals to integers to show countable. Is this argument correct?
","Let $E_n = \left\{ x \in \left( a , b \right) \mid \lvert \lim_{t \to x^+} f(t) - 
\lim_{t \to x^-} f(t) \rvert &gt; \frac{1}{n} \right\}$, the set of simple discontinuities whose jumps are greater than $\frac{1}{n}$. Then $E_1 \subset E_2 \subset\cdots$ and $\cup^\infty_{i=1} E_i$ is the set of all simple discontinuities. If all of the $E_n$ are countable, then $\cup^\infty_{i=1}E_i$ is countable.

Suppose $ x \in E_n $.

The left-hand limit exists, so

$$
\exists \delta^-_x &gt; 0 \colon t \in \left( x - \delta^-_x, x \right) \implies \lvert f(t) - \lim_{t \to x^-} f(t) \rvert &lt; \frac{1}{4n}
$$

Suppose $y \in \left( x - \delta^-_x, x \right)$ is a simple discontinuity. Then

$$
\exists \delta^-_y &gt; 0 \colon t \in ( y - \delta^-_y, y ) \implies \lvert f(t) - \lim_{t \to y^-} f(t) \rvert &lt; \frac{1}{4n} \\
\exists \delta^+_y &gt; 0 \colon t \in ( y, y + \delta^+_y ) \implies \lvert f(t) - \lim_{t \to y^+} f(t) \rvert &lt; \frac{1}{4n}
$$

Then $\exists z^- \in (y - \delta^-_y, y) \cap (x - \delta^-_x, x), z^+ \in (y, y + \delta^+_y) \cap (x - \delta^-_x, x) \colon$

$$
\lvert \lim_{t \to y^+} f(t) - \lim_{t \to y^-} f(t) \rvert \leq \\
\lvert \lim_{t \to y^+} f(t) - \lim_{t \to x^-} f(t) \rvert + \lvert \lim_{t \to y^-} f(t) - \lim_{t \to x^-} f(t) \rvert \leq \\
\lvert \lim_{t \to y^+} f(t) - f(z^+) \rvert + \lvert \lim_{t \to x^-} f(t) - f(z^+) \rvert + \lvert \lim_{t \to y^-} f(t) - f(z^-) \rvert + \lvert \lim_{t \to x^-} f(t) - f(z^-) \rvert \leq \\
\frac{1}{n}
$$

So that 

$$
\forall x \in E_n \exists \delta &gt; 0 \colon y \in (x - \delta, x )  \implies y \not \in E_n
$$

This says that for a jump at $x$, there exists a left-hand neighborhood around x such that the jumps in the neighborhood are smaller than the jump at $x$ (we could prove the same thing for a right-hand neighborhood, but that turns out to be unnecessary). For each $x$, choose a rational number $q \in \mathbb{Q}$ from $(x - \delta, x )$, e.g., 

$$
\frac{ \lceil (x - \delta) ( \lceil \frac{1}{\delta} \rceil + 1 ) \rceil + 1}{\lceil \frac{1}{\delta} \rceil + 1}
$$

Since the $(x - \delta, x)$ are disjoint, $g \colon x \mapsto q$ is an injection $g \colon E_n \rightarrowtail \mathbb{Q}$ (each $x$ maps to a different $q$). Since $\mathbb{Q}$ is countable, so is $E_n$.

Unfortunately, instead of the photo album protecting the pictures, the plastic coverings yellowed, and the pictures themselves had to be carefully extracted from the books.

3114,3114,4962,Do citizens of Hong Kong living in Canada - still need a visa to enter Russia for <2 weeks?,"From what I understand, citizens of Hong kong (i.e. holders or HK Special Administrative Region passports) do not require a visa to go to Russia for short trips less than 14 days, according to this page. Does it make a difference if that person currently lives in another country, such as Canada, citizens of which - do require a visa to go to Russia? The same person is also holding a Canadian passport.

Does current residency play a role in this matter at all, if the person tries to enter Russia as a Hong Kong citizen?

I have a strange issue with Quicklook in Lion. This is on a clean install and happens with  more than one user. It also isn't fixed if I clean out the Quicklook cache in /var/folders

I have to push the spacebar twice to get Quicklook to work properly.

Push the spacebar again and the image appears. If I restart the Finder the problem goes away briefly. It's driving me nuts.

3234,3234,5157,How should hands that are EXTREMELY strong in one suit (10+ cards) be bid?,"I'm a bit of a bridge noob, but I'm kind of puzzled about this. Say I have a hand that is ridiculously strong in one suit, say at least 10 cards with all 4 honors (I'll use spades for the example suit). how should I bid? This is so many cards that almost nobody will be leading spades but me, so if another suit is trump, I'm flush out of luck.

Obviously I would want to end up playing a spade contract with a good potential for a slam, but if I open too high, say 5 spades, won't my opponents catch on pretty quickly and bid in their own suits or No-trump, just so my spades will be next to useless? They will likely have favorable distributions for their own suits since nearly all the spades are gone, which only worsens the fact. Then again, if I bid to low, my partner may not rebid, and while taking 12 tricks at a contract of 3S is obviously good, knowing you will have that many overtricks from the start seems kind of a waste.

Even if I held 12 or 13 spades, if I bid 7S, won't my opponents just bid 7NT and I'll never get to lead? How should hands with this heavy a distribution be bid to make the most of them?

(I've already said I'm not a very experienced bridge player, so if I'm making any glaring oversights don't hesitate in the slightest to bring them up.)



NOTE: I know these hands are extremely rare, but in all reality, every single possible hand is rare enough that studying bridge hands is actually quite useless because you'll never see the same hand again in your life...but we do it anyway because that's how we learn. Couldn't you tell anyone asking about a specific hand not to worry about it because it'll never show up again? :D
