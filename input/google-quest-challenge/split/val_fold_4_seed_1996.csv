1587,1587,2501,Why don't banks give access to all your transaction activity?,"In the era of big data, I find it surprising that banks and credit card companies only offer access to a ridiculously small number of transactions - often only your last 180 days, if that. The longest I've seen was 720 days going back. I suspect they do store everything, but intentionally limit access.

These transactions are text only, take up extremely little space, and storing an individual's lifetime worth of transaction would take less than 10MB of data; about the storage required by two MP3 files, and about 250k records per person per lifetime, if we generously assume everyone makes 10 transactions a day. But I'd be happy with only the last 10 years of transactions, so about 1MB per customer. One of the largest banks, JP Morgan Chase, has ~70MM credit card customers. That means 70TB of data for 10 years of records - hardly impressive for a corporation of that size, with $17B of net income in 2013, when 1TB of cloud storage costs $10 retail per month.

By comparison, would you put up with Gmail or any online email provider keeping only the most recent 120 days worth of email? (And emails do take a lot more space than transactions, are far more numerous, and have to be instantly retrievable.)

Storage requirements for transaction activity are trivial in an era where we're throwing around petabytes and zetabytes.

Is there a sound reason for banks not offering access to all your transactions, other than legacy software on their side?




",Dan Dascalescu,https://money.stackexchange.com/users/12977,"Heterogenous archives

A big issue for historical data in banking is that they don't/can't reside within a single system.

Archives of typical bank will include dozen(s) of different archives made by different companies on different, incompatible systems.

Often, when integrating such systems, a compromise is made - if bank A acquires bank B that has earlier acquired bank C, then if the acquisition of C was a few years ago, then you can skip integrating the archives of C in your online systems, keep them separate, and use them only when/if needed (and minimize that need by hefty fees). 

Since the price list and services are supposed to be equal for everyone, then no matter how your accounts originated, if 10% of archives are an expensive enough problem to integrate, then it makes financial sense to restrict access to 100% of archives older than some arbitrary threshold.

Should I completely be a ""nerd"" and work on my thesis systematically (something I could never make in my entire life) or working periodically but with extra effort is still sufficient?

Sure there are fun times fiddling with the knobs of expensive equipment, drawing equations on napkins until late in the night, traveling to exotic conference locations like Baltimore, etc. There are also these brief moments when you feel like an undergrad actually learned something from you, and those where you share inside jokes that you can tell for sure only your advisor and yourself can understand.

But there are other aspects that are less glamorous.

I don't know what GPA is, nor how to interpret your grade, but the context tells me that you think they could be better.

3928,3928,6265,Oracle.DataAccess.Client.BulkCopy - trying to cast varchar2 as number when it shouldn't,"I have a table (A)  that includes a column named confirmation_number.  It is defined as a varchar2(30) and contains something like SMITERI-2012-02-31-4567.

I have another table (B) that also includes a column named confirmation_number, and it is also a varchar2(30).

I have a stored procedure that extracts the data from A, performing some transformation on it, and it includes the confirmation number column.  

I use C# and ODP.Net to run the stored procedure and load a DataTable with it.  I then perform some additional transformations.  However, I never touch the confirmation number column.

Finally, I create an OracleBulkCopy object, set the column mappings, tell it to update Table B, and call loader.WriteToServer(dataTable).

I am getting the following error:

Input string was not in a correct format.
   at System.Number.StringToNumber(String str, NumberStyles options, NumberBuffer&amp; number, NumberFormatInfo info, Boolean parseDecimal)
   at System.Number.ParseInt64(String value, NumberStyles options, NumberFormatInfo numfmt)
   at Oracle.DataAccess.Client.OracleBulkCopy.PerformBulkCopy()


I have confirmed that the error occurs on the confirmation_number column, because if I don't load that column, the dataload succeeds.

Any ideas why the BulkCopy would be trying to turn a varchar(2) into a Number?

EDIT:
I have confirmed the following relevant issues:


This is happening on more than just the confirmation number.  This
appears to only be a problem on string columns - whether from a
string to a string or a string to an integer. 
This doesn't happen on every varchar2 column - last name and first name have no trouble.
This happens both on columns that have no null values (confirmation
number) and on columns that may have null values (street type).
Investigating the contents of the datatable at the moment before the
loader begins shows no difference in column definition between those
that successfully go in and those that do not.


I'm beginning to wonder if there's a bug in the BulkCopy itself and if I need to do this load using another utility.

It is definitely slower than a successful bulk load, but at least I can get the data in.  I'd still love if anyone has any ideas on why the bulkcopy itself keeps failing, though.

I have been unable to get the bulkcopy to work, but I have gotten the traditional method of using arrays to work: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/issue-archive/2009/09-sep/o59odpnet-085168.html

It is definitely slower than a successful bulk load, but at least I can get the data in.  I'd still love if anyone has any ideas on why the bulkcopy itself keeps failing, though.
","I believe the problem is in your ""date_of_birth"" column. you are passing a string and not a date. since dates are numbers, it tries to cast them, but it is not in a format it expect, you changed the order of months and days.

3233,3233,5156,Why do the Borg have physical computer interfaces?,"I was watching Scorpion (VOY) parts 1 and 2 last night and a thought struck me: sure, their computer interface looks pretty cool, but why do they have a physical interface (i.e. they tap the screen physically) in the first place?  It's made quite clear that they can interface with each other through mental transceivers and they make a big deal about thoughts being a more efficient communication method than verbal communication in Scorpion Part 2 with Tuvok and Janeway.  Therefore, wouldn't a mental interface with a computer be more efficient?  Surely, then, they could have the drones in their stations for most of the time, just thinking to interact with the computer rather than having to tap their way through an interface.  Is there any reason given for this?

And, although I only recall seeing 7 of 9 using the computer via physical interaction in Scorpion, there are plenty of instances in other episodes where other drones also use physical interaction with the computer.
",Often Right,https://scifi.stackexchange.com/users/22917,"1) Efficiency of Assimilation - As mentioned by MarvelX42, when assimilating a ship that uses screens, it makes sense to just keep using those screens rather than to re-program the whole ship to bypass them.  This is especially compelling since we see ""Borg consoles"" much more often on assimilated ships, like the Enterprise-E, than on native Borg constructs, like the Cubes, where Drones are more commonly locked into their docking stations.

However, there are three other considerations that may be relevant:

2) Security - The Borg have been shown to be a powerful force, but they have still been hacked before, sometimes to disastrous effect.  There may be a certain amount of security in having certain significant functions, like propulsion and weapons, require a physical presence at a console.  That way, an errant Drone or an outside influence cannot gain complete control remotely.

3) Efficiency and Decentralization - It may be more efficient to have Drones perform certain functions physically, rather than devote bandwidth and processing power that could be used for more difficult operations.  It's impossible to say without examining the exact technical setup of the Collective, but it may be that their mental network is reserved for communication, analysis, and forming a consensus, while the trillions of commands for controlling equipment aren't processed through the Collective at large.  Therefore, the Collective decides where a ship should go, and then a Drone inputs the commands into the ship manually so as not to clutter up the data stream with the nitty-gritty details of execution.

4) Cybernetic Compatibility - It is easy to think of the Borg as a purely mechanical, computerized race, but we are reminded over and over that their biological components are equally important.  It may very well be that their biological halves are why the consoles remain necessary. The Borg are obviously VERY well-integrated with their ships, facilities, and tools, but that integration may not be perfect, so it may not be entirely possible to control a ship, especially an assimilated ship built by others, by thought alone.  Whatever prevents the Borg from making purely-robotic Drones may be preventing them from fully interfacing with their ships as well.

It's impossible to say for sure, but I think between those four answers, we've probably got a rough understanding.

A differential backup backs up changes since the last full backup (not, as some people assume, since the last differential!). In order to do a differential backup, you need only add the with differential clause to your normal backup. So something like:

Consider the database below.

The [Document] table contains thousands of large files and has become some 100 GB large. The database must be backed up on a regular basis.

Now, let's say I run a full backup my database. Then I add one document of 1 MB. When the next backup is scheduled a new 100+ GB backup file will be created. Obviously, this is not very cost efficient. As far as I understand, SQL Server does not support incremental backups out of the box, but I sense it should be possible to do this manually. Especially for FILESTREAM data where the data resides on the file system.

Q: How do I perform incremental backup of FILESTREAM data?

4900,4900,7798,Paying for mortgage points vs investing that money,"First time home buyer here.

So I've been reading about points and how an up-front payment can save you money in the long term.  At first, the numbers seem pretty convincing.  For example, pay $5000 upfront for a whopping saving of $20,000 over 30 years.  

... But if you took that $5000 and invested it, wouldn't you get a lot more than that over 30 years, even at a modest return rate of 6-7%?  Suddenly points seem worthless.

Is my math wrong?  Is there some other advantage regarding points that I'm missing?
",anon,https://money.stackexchange.com/users/3505,"Let me give you the benefit of my experience. I paid a bunch of points (4) when I bought my first house for similar reasons than you mentioned including:


Lower interest rate would result in savings over life of 30yr loan
I had a big capital gain from cashing out stocks for the house down payment and the points (as interest) would offset the tax liability.


Why I wish I hadn't:
(1) Interest rates plummeted (not as likely to happen today) and I wound up refinancing the loan within the fist 10 years negating the savings that I would have had over the life of the loan. Also, it made me feel stupid for paying close to $5K to knock 1% or so off the loan rate only to have an even lower rate offered to me with no points within a decade.

(2) I didn't take into account that I'm the type of person who would try to pay the loan off early, and I did. Way Early. So even if I hadn't refinanced, the extra points were really a waste of money.

(3) In the US, at least, you can't always deduct ALL of the money you paid in points in the first year. You may have to spread that deduction over several years.

(4) You are right about the alternative being better (investing the points), since the benefit of paying them is at most 1-2% on your loan, you don't even need a 6-7% return to make it a better deal to invest them. HOWEVER, I get skeptical when people compare paying interest to returns on invested money like that. If you don't pay the points will you actually invest that money for the 30 years (or whatever the term of the loan is)? It's easy to say that when you are talking theoreticals, but $5k in your pocket is also pretty tempting when the deal is done.

It crashes on the saveToPersistent method with EXC_BAD_ACCESS.
How can I fix this and what could be the reason for my NSFetchresultscontroller calling a method on a UIBarButtonItem? 
","Your saveMainContext method should only be called from the main thread and should simply be implemented as:

- (BOOL)saveMainContext
{
    NSError *error = nil;
    if ([[[[CoreDataManager sharedInstance] objectStore] mainQueueManagedObjectContext] saveToPersistentStore:&amp;error]) {
        contextSaved = YES;
    } else {
        NSLog(@""Save error: %@"", error);
    }

    return contextSaved;
}


Calling an instance of UIBarButtonItem suggests that you have a memory management issue in that something which is observing the context save is not removing itself before it is deallocated. Check all of your observers.

",arnab,https://stats.stackexchange.com/users/48559,"This is an important consideration in designing experiments, where it can be desirable to have no (or very little) correlation among the estimates $\hat a$ and $\hat b$.  Such lack of correlation can be achieved by controlling the values of the $X_i$.



To analyze the effects of the $X_i$ on the estimates, the values $(1,X_i)$ (which are row vectors of length $2$) are assembled vertically into a matrix $X$, the design matrix, having as many rows as there are data and (obviously) two columns.  The corresponding $Y_i$ are assembled into one long (column) vector $y$.  In these terms, writing $\beta = (a,b)^\prime$ for the assembled coefficients, the model is

$$\mathbb{E}(Y) = X \cdot \beta$$

The $Y_i$ are (usually) assumed to be independent random variables whose variances are a constant $\sigma^2$ for some unknown $\sigma \gt 0$.  The dependent observations $y$ are taken to be one realization of the vector-valued random variable $Y$.

The OLS solution is

$$\hat\beta = \left(X^\prime X\right)^{-1} X^\prime y,$$

assuming this matrix inverse exists.  Thus, using basic properties of matrix multiplication and covariance,

$$\text{Cov}(\hat\beta) = \text{Cov}\left(\left(X^\prime X\right)^{-1} X^\prime Y\right) = \left(\left(X^\prime X\right)^{-1} X^\prime\sigma^2   
X \left( X^\prime X \right)^{-1\prime}  \right) = \sigma^2 \left(X^\prime X\right)^{-1}.  $$

The matrix $\left(X^\prime X\right)^{-1}$ has just two rows and two columns, each corresponding to the model parameters $(a,b)$.  The correlation of $\hat a$ with $\hat b$ is proportional to the off-diagonal elements, which are just the dot products of the two columns of $X$.  Since one of the columns is all $1$s, whose dot product with the other column (containing the of $X_i$) is their sum, we find


  $\hat a$ and $\hat b$ are uncorrelated if and only the sum (or equivalently the mean) of the $X_i$ is zero.


This condition frequently is achieved by recentering the $X_i$ (by subtracting their mean from each).  Although this will not alter the estimated slope $\hat b$, it does change the estimated intercept $\hat a$.  Whether or not that is important depends on the application.



All this analysis applies to multiple regression: the design matrix will have $p+1$ columns for $p$ independent variables (remember, an additional column consists of $1$s) and $\beta$ will be a vector of length $p+1$, but otherwise everything goes through exactly as before.  In conventional language, two columns of $X$ are called orthogonal when their dot product is zero.  Thus,


  Two multiple regression coefficient estimates $\hat\beta_i$ and $\hat\beta_j$ are uncorrelated if and only if the corresponding columns of the design matrix are orthogonal.


Many standard experimental designs consist of choosing values of the independent variables to make the columns orthogonal.  This ""separates"" the resulting estimates by guaranteeing--before any data are ever collected!--that the estimates will be uncorrelated.  (When the responses have Normal distributions this implies the estimates will be independent, which greatly simplifies their interpretation.)

1597,1597,2513,Homework with logarithms,"I'm stuck on continuing the next exercise:


  Considering:

  $\log_{c}b = 4$
  
  and:
  
  $$
y = \frac{a^{3}\sqrt{b \cdot c^{2}}}{2}

  What's the value of $\log_{c}y$ (integer)?


So far, I did all the substitutions that were obvious at my eyes:

$$
y = \frac{a^{3}\sqrt{b \cdot c^{2}}}{2}\quad\rightarrow\quad
y = \frac{c^{9}\sqrt{c^{4} \cdot c^{2}}}{2}\quad\rightarrow\quad
y = \frac{c^{9}\sqrt{c^{6}}}{2}\quad\rightarrow\quad
y = \frac{c^{9} c^{3}}{2}\quad\rightarrow\quad
y = \frac{c^{12}}{2}
$$

The last equality is the same as $c^{12} = 2y$, which could be written as:

$$
\log_{c}2y = 12\quad\rightarrow\quad
\log_{c}2 + \log_{c}y = 12
$$

I really don't know haw to continue. I've managed to find a $\log_{c}y$, but I don't know what to do with the $\log_{c}2$. Either I took the wrong path, or I'm missing something that prevents me to finish this exercise.

  Considering:
  
  $\log_{c}a = 3$
  $\log_{c}b = 4$
  
  and:
  
  $$
y = \frac{a^{3}\sqrt{b \cdot c^{2}}}{2}
$$
  
  What's the value of $\log_{c}y$ (integer)?


So far, I did all the substitutions that were obvious at my eyes:

$$
y = \frac{a^{3}\sqrt{b \cdot c^{2}}}{2}\quad\rightarrow\quad
y = \frac{c^{9}\sqrt{c^{4} \cdot c^{2}}}{2}\quad\rightarrow\quad
y = \frac{c^{9}\sqrt{c^{6}}}{2}\quad\rightarrow\quad
y = \frac{c^{9} c^{3}}{2}\quad\rightarrow\quad
y = \frac{c^{12}}{2}
$$

The last equality is the same as $c^{12} = 2y$, which could be written as:

$$
\log_{c}2y = 12\quad\rightarrow\quad
\log_{c}2 + \log_{c}y = 12
$$

I really don't know haw to continue. I've managed to find a $\log_{c}y$, but I don't know what to do with the $\log_{c}2$. Either I took the wrong path, or I'm missing something that prevents me to finish this exercise.

Any hints are much welcome! Thanks in advance.
","Take $\log_c$ of both sides of the equation:

$$ \log_c y=3\log_c a+\frac12\log_c b+1-\log_c 2.$$ 
And so,
$$\log_c y=3(3)+\frac12(4)+1-\log_c 2=12-\log_c 2.$$

We define an anonymous function here, which takes jQuery as its only argument. It gets mapped to $ in the above function and your code will work just as expected. You can very well do things like this.

(function($){
    $(document).ready(function(){
        //Write your jQuery code here as usual using $.

my custom code is just to change css style of items in menu(I'll post that code aswell).

My issue is that Fullscreenr and ScrollTo were working fine but when I want to add VideoBox the video popup doesn't want to work all it does is redirect to the youtube page. When I inspect the page(Chrome) it shows this error:

on this line:

this.overlay = new Element('div').setProperty('id', 'lbOverlay').injectInside(document.body);

If there is a better script I can use I welcome any and all suggestions aswell.
","This will work if multiple libraries use the same $ in a webpage.

(function($){

//Write your jQuery code here as usual using $.

We define an anonymous function here, which takes jQuery as its only argument. It gets mapped to $ in the above function and your code will work just as expected. You can very well do things like this.

(function($){
    $(document).ready(function(){
        //Write your jQuery code here as usual using $.

There are many differences between the two, but with regards to ""open in [...] Explorer View"" both are a resounding ""No"".

Explorer View can show list columns with some data types like numbers and text. 

Wiki pages can have text, images, tables and web parts and other rich elements embedded. A wiki page can contain one or more of each of these elements. These items will not show as columns in an Explorer view.

You need to learn about, and understand, the difference of data types that SharePoint captures. Wiki pages cannot easily be translated into a grid view.

Enterprise Wiki pages are a different chapter altogether. They are a publishing content type, and you will need to understand publishing content types to deal with this data.

Edit: You can add custom columns to a wiki library to categorise items. You can then build a view that shows the page title and the category column. Switch to the Data View to bulk edit the page properties.

",Madhav Sudarshan,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/users/17174,"The KLMN(OP) method is based on electron shells, with the labels KLMN(OP) being derived from an experiment in which the spectroscopist wanted to leave room for lower energy transitions in case their were any.

K denotes the first shell (or energy level), L the second shell, M, the third shell, and so on. In other words, the KLMN(OP) notation only indicates the number of electrons an atom has with each principle quantum number ($n$).

The SPDF notation subdivides each shell into its subshells. For further information about the other quantum numbers, especially $l$, which defines the subshell, see the accepted answer to this question: What do the quantum numbers actually signify?


  The K shell can hold two electrons: $n=1,\ l=0$


When $l=0$, we have an $s$ subshell, which has one orbital $m_l=0$, with room for two electrons.


  The L shell can hold 8 elections: $n=2,\ l=0,1$

K denotes the first shell (or energy level), L the second shell, M, the third shell, and so on. In other words, the KLMN(OP) notation only indicates the number of electrons an atom has with each principle quantum number ($n$).

The SPDF notation subdivides each shell into its subshells. For further information about the other quantum numbers, especially $l$, which defines the subshell, see the accepted answer to this question: What do the quantum numbers actually signify?


  The K shell can hold two electrons: $n=1,\ l=0$

4731,4731,7505,Will a spellcaster interrupted mid-meditation or -study have any spells?,"I've noticed that Wizards, Clerics, Druids, and most other spell-casting classes (With the exception of Sorcerers) spend at least 1 hour Studying or Meditating to regain their spells.

What I want to know is that if I (As the GM) used an encounter to interrupt the preparation time of the party halfway through, will the party have any spells available to utilise?  If they do, is there any RAW method to restrict which spells they will have? (Such as no spells requiring an attack roll, or spells that deal damage.)

Is there anything I can do to force a Sorcerer or other spontaneous caster to contend with the same issue?

Backstory:

I want to introduce a recurring villain, who will be involved as a plot device for quite a while before eventually transforming into a BBEG.  Said villain will have quite high DR-which will prevent melee characters from being able to kill him, but looking for a method to surprise the casters, forcing them to look for alternate methods to escape. (Particular villain has yet to be decided, but I don't think it would help the answer at all.)

I'm not looking to kill the PCs, at all.  Just want a way to scare them a bit, making them think about what they are actually doing.

I have considered an anti-magic field already, but I think this would lead the party to kiting, rather then looking outside the box.
",Nyoze,https://rpg.stackexchange.com/users/23186,"Officially, interrupting the 1-hour of meditation or study results in no spells prepared...

Each of the classes you mention has no provision for partial preparation of spells.


""Each cleric must choose a time when she must spend 1 hour each day in quiet contemplation or supplication to regain her daily allotment of spells.""
""A druid must spend 1 hour each day in a trance-like meditation on the mysteries of nature to regain her daily allotment of spells.""
""[A wizard]  must choose and prepare his spells ahead of time by getting 8 hours of sleep and spending 1 hour studying his spellbook.""


Using a strict reading of the rules as they are written, that's exactly how long preparing all of the appropriate caster's spells takes, and stopping early means no prepared spells. Yes, the day after the massive battle that exhausted all his spells, even Count Slimeheart, Archmage of the Drooling Tower, if interrupted 1 min. before finishing his hour of study, will find himself with no spells prepared.

But, as per Preparing Wizard Spells, a wizard


  [p]reparing some smaller portion of his daily capacity takes a proportionally smaller amount of time, but always at least 15 minutes, the minimum time required to achieve the proper mental state.


Thus, a wizard can choose beforehand after resting to prepare a fraction of his spells, yet it's up to the DM if the wizard who planned to spend an hour preparing but actually spent less time preparing has prepared some of his spells or none at all.

Likewise, as per Preparing Divine Spells, divine spell casters who prepare spells must meditate for at least 15 min. at their appointed or chosen time, but can also leave spell slots unfilled for filling later, taking 15 min. per quarter of spells.

(A clever wizard or divine caster of prepared spells may start preparing 25% of his spells in 15-min. bursts instead of 1-hour long stretches, or the DM can just assume every experienced caster does this. I'm going to go out on a limb and say that this isn't the default method of spell preparation because the default method of 1 hour and get 'em all makes bookkeeping easier and arguments fewer.)

...And sorcerers need only 15 min. to concentrate...

Although sorcerers lack many problems their more devout and studious compatriots possess...


  Unlike a wizard or a cleric, a sorcerer need not prepare her spells in advance. She can cast any spell she knows at any time, assuming she has not yet used up her spells per day for that spell level.


...the section Magic under Sorcerers and Bards says


  Each day, sorcerers and bards must focus their minds on the task of casting their spells. A sorcerer or bard needs 8 hours of rest (just like a wizard), after which she spends 15 minutes concentrating. (A bard must sing, recite, or play an instrument of some kind while concentrating.) During this period, the sorcerer or bard readies her mind to cast her daily allotment of spells. Without such a period to refresh herself, the character does not regain the spell slots she used up the day before.


So there's a 15 min. window during which a sorcerer still hasn't regained yesterday's used spell slots upon awakening from 8 hours rest, but then the sorcerer's ready to go. (Of course, there's also the 50/50 chance he's 1 entire spell level below other full casters, but that's beside the point.)

...So the the GM could make a house rule that such concentration takes longer than 15 min.

If made at the campaign's beginning, a house rule mandating that the sorcerer (and similar casters like the bard) must spend, instead, an hour concentrating upon awakening from 8 hours rest is reasonable. Although such characters often have hard enough lives, such characters are also usually full casters, so it's not as damaging a house rule as, for example, a house rule that somehow nerfs melee attacks. It's a burden, certainly, but it's not an excessive burden so far as house rules go.

However, a GM who makes such a house rule mid-campaign then attacks the party of sorcerers 16 min. into their preparation time is really just asking his players to leave.



An Aside: Please don't attack PCs while they're preparing spells. If you do, they'll try to do the same to the bad guys. You don't want to spend a whole afternoon making a wizard baddie only to have the baddie dead before his turn because the PCs interrupted him while he was studying, so don't do that to the PCs your players have been tinkering with for months either.

If you're afraid of the PCs downing the big bad evil guy early, don't use him! Send instead paid assassins, bound or allied creatures, created minions, simulacra, projected images, or fanatics. Have the baddie mail threatening letters containing a magic mouth or explosive runes. While the PCs aren't around, have the villain explode their home towns, frame them for crimes, damage their reputations, hurt their moms, ruin their NPC friends, and eat their pets. Sending the BBEG into harm's way means the PCs should have a chance to end him. (And any method the GM uses to save the BBEG should eventually be accessible to the PCs!) If the only way to further the plot is a house rule that mandates sorcerers concentrate longer, it might be time to consider—sadly—a different plot.

5968,5968,9460,AES using derived keys / IVs. Does it introduce a weakness?,"I'm looking for an efficient way to encrypt multiple fields in a database with AES using a single global key, used throughout a large web application.

Obviously in order to re-use this key, a unique random IV is required for each field that is to be encrypted.

I'd rather not introduce more fields to the database to store each of these IVs, so the programatic approach seems to be to derive these IVs some how.

I'm toying with using either:

key = sha256(global_key + table_name)
iv = sha256(column_name + primary_key)


Or even simply:

key = global_key
iv = sha256(table_name + column_name + primary_key)


I'm leaning towards the former to generate per-table keys.

I've already read that the IVs do not need to be kept secret. So I'm working on the assumption that a derived key or IV (even if the algorithm becomes known), is no more insecure than any other non-secret IV, as long as the original key remains secret.

The question is:

Is there a fatal flaw in my approach? Am I introducing any serious weaknesses that, in the event that an adversary obtains a copy of the database, would make it easier for them to retrieve the plaintext data?

I realise that is potentially soliciting one word answers.

Suggestions for alternate / better schemes very much welcomed, as well as references to existing works and how they implement similar scenarios.
",Leigh,https://security.stackexchange.com/users/1349,"Your approach is insecure.  If you modify some value in the database, you'll be encrypting a new value using the same IV as you used to encrypt the prior value.  (The data will be stored in the same place, so the table name, column name, and primary key will remain unchanged.)  This might compromise confidentiality.  The compromise is especially bad if you are using a stream cipher or AES-CTR or similar mode, as then you've encrypted two different values using the same stream, a classic keystream-reuse vulnerability (the two-time pad is highly insecure).

Instead, it is better to do as others recommend: generate a random IV, and store it together with the ciphertext.  Indeed, in most modes of operation, you can consider the IV to be part of the ciphertext.

905,905,1437,"Maximal ideal in $\mathbb{Q}[x,y]$","I am trying to prove that $(x,y)$ is a maximal ideal of $\mathbb{Q}[x,y]$. Since an ideal $I \subseteq R$ is maximal if and only if $R/I$ is a field, it suffices to prove that $\mathbb{Q}[x,y]/(x,y)$ is a field.
Let $\phi : \mathbb{Q}[x,y] \rightarrow \mathbb{Q}$ be the evaluation homomorphism that sends $p(x,y)$ to $p(0,0)$. $\phi$ is clearly surjective and if I prove that the kernel of $\phi$ is the ideal $(x,y)$, the result will follow by the First Isomorphism Theorem.    

$(x,y) \subseteq Ker(\phi)$ is obvious, but to prove the reverse inclusion, my idea is to take a polynomial $p(x,y) \in Ker(\phi)$ and to perform Euclidean division of $p(x,y)$ with $y$ and $x$ in $(\mathbb{Q}[x])[y]$ and $(\mathbb{Q}[y])[x]$ respectively. The problem is that neither of them is a polynomial ring over field. There is a theorem saying that if R is commutative and if $R[x]$ is a PID, then $R$ is a field. Since neither $\mathbb{Q}[x]$, nor $\mathbb{Q}[y]$ are fields, it follows that neither $(\mathbb{Q}[x])[y]$, nor $(\mathbb{Q}[y])[x]$ are PIDs, hence are not Euclidean domains.   

Obviously, Euclidean division does not solve the problem. If we consider $p(x,y)$ as an element in $(\mathbb{Q}[x])[y]$ and if we divide by $y$, then we get a quotient $q(x,y)$ and a remainder which is $0$ or of degree $0$ over $(\mathbb{Q}[x])[y]$, hence a polynomial $r(x)$ in $x$ only.    

Then, $p(x,y) = yq(x,y) + r(x)$ and the hypothesis $p(0,0)=0$ does not guarantee that $r(x)=0$. So, we cannot conclude that $y$ divides $p(x,y)$.

  Would 2,5-dinitropyrrole be a product of nitration of pyrrole with $\ce{H2SO4/HNO3}$?


I doubt it and would rather expect a lot of tar to be formed here. Pyrrole tends to undergo acid-catalyzed polymerization!

For decades, acetyl nitrate, formed by addition of fuming nitric acid to acetic anhydride, is the reagent of choice. 

Mononitration of pyrrole predominantly gives 2-nitropyrrole, accompanied by minor amounts of 3-nitropyrrole. (K.J. Morgan and D.P. Morrey, Tetrahedron, 1966, 22, 57-62. DOI). 

In the case of 1-methylpyrrole, the yield of the 3-nitropyrole is somewhat larger (H.J. Anderson, Canad. J. Chem, 1957, 35, 23-29). In you want even more of the 3-nitro isomer, a more bulky alkyl substituent (t-Bu) or N-silylation with $\ce{((CH3)CH)2SiCl}$ is a viable approach.

Nitration of 2-nitropyrrole at -15 °C with nitric acid in acetic anhydride  furnishes a 4:1 mixture of 2,4- and 2,5-dinitropyrrole with a total yield of 61%. (R. Alan Jones, Gerritt P. Bean, The Chemistry of Pyrroles: Organic Chemistry: A Series of Monographs, Vol. 34, Academic Press, p. 124)

3550,3550,5662,How to remember 10 last read articles with timestamp in session for a user in Codeigniter?,"I would like to make a PHP if condition code that will check if the last 10 articles or 10 minutes from the article reading by the user have already elapsed.

E.g. 

A user open a page with id = 235 (this id value is in the url localhost/article/235 )

and this id value will be saved in session with a current timestamp and maybe his IP address

Then he read another article and the same will happen.

I need to remember the clicked stuff for another ten clicks and then reset that only for the first row. E.g. after the 10th click the id and timestamp will not became 11th row but will replace the 1st row in the list.

The php condition in CodeIgniter will then check these values and will update the article hit counter value in the articles table and column counter like this:   

   $this-&gt;db-&gt;where('id', $id);
   $this-&gt;db-&gt;set('counter', 'counter+1', FALSE);
   $this-&gt;db-&gt;update('articles');


But before calling this code I need to make this check from the session?

How to do that?

I think storing e.g. 10 entries in the session with timestamps per user will be enough.

Just don't save the same page in the session twice.

And the condition will check the current timestamp with the saved one and if it is more than e.g. 10 minutes or the user have read/clicked another 10 articles it will allow the update counter php code.

I don't need to have this bulletproof. Just to disable the increment using browser's refresh button. 

So, if he wants to increment the counter he will need to wait ten minutes or read another 10 articles ;)

1600,1600,2516,Dealing with digital circuits and their associated switching speed?,"When designing a digital one-minute counting circuit I came across a difficult problem. 

Basically, I designed the circuit to drive the (normally HIGH) clock of the 10s slot low if the 1s slot's current state was 9 (actually, just if the first and last bits are HIGH -> 1001)

The devices I am using are positive edge, so when the 1s slot returns to zero the condition is no longer satisfied - therefore the clock returns to a HIGH state and increments the 10s slot.

The problem is that I was getting double clock problems(7->8 transition and the designed clock mechanism).   

It turns out that there was just enough delay in the switching between 7 -> 8 (0111 -> 1000) that the first/last bit HIGH condition is satisfied:

i.e., some combination occurs in the transition period to register a logical HIGH at the output

1001 1011 1101 1111

The temporary solution to the problem I came up with was to actually keep the clock for the 10s slot LOW until the condition where the 1s slot equals 0 (0000) is satisfied(So, essentially clock WHEN we get to the state as opposed to before). However, this solution requires too many gates (a 4-input NOR minimum). My previous design was actually fed from another part in the design that is already present, so it didn't require any additional circuitry.

",user5268,https://magento.stackexchange.com/users/5268,"It depends on what you wan't to do. If you just want to start off implementing simple theme's some knowledge of PHP and frontending (HTML, JS, CSS) should be enough.

But if you really want to get down and dirty with customising Magento, extensions and functionality you will need a good grasp on PHP, OOP, MySQL might be handy and Javascript, preferably prototype.

My advice, first get your PHP skills up to speed, afterwards follow some courses on Magento U and start off with a simple shop tweaking some minor stuff. All in all this should keep you busy for the upcoming 6 months. Just doing frontend stuff will take you less time but will limit you to implement theme's and installing extensions without being able to tweak them.

What are the easiest steps for learning magento. Please give me some ideas.

Thanks.
","It depends on what you wan't to do. If you just want to start off implementing simple theme's some knowledge of PHP and frontending (HTML, JS, CSS) should be enough.

But if you really want to get down and dirty with customising Magento, extensions and functionality you will need a good grasp on PHP, OOP, MySQL might be handy and Javascript, preferably prototype.

My advice, first get your PHP skills up to speed, afterwards follow some courses on Magento U and start off with a simple shop tweaking some minor stuff. All in all this should keep you busy for the upcoming 6 months. Just doing frontend stuff will take you less time but will limit you to implement theme's and installing extensions without being able to tweak them.

593,593,926,Homework with logarithms,"I'm stuck on continuing the next exercise:


  Considering:
  
  $\log_{c}a = 3$
  $\log_{c}b = 4$
  
  and:
  
  $$
y = \frac{a^{3}\sqrt{b \cdot c^{2}}}{2}
$$
  
  What's the value of $\log_{c}y$ (integer)?


So far, I did all the substitutions that were obvious at my eyes:

$$
y = \frac{a^{3}\sqrt{b \cdot c^{2}}}{2}\quad\rightarrow\quad
y = \frac{c^{9}\sqrt{c^{4} \cdot c^{2}}}{2}\quad\rightarrow\quad
y = \frac{c^{9}\sqrt{c^{6}}}{2}\quad\rightarrow\quad
y = \frac{c^{9} c^{3}}{2}\quad\rightarrow\quad
y = \frac{c^{12}}{2}
$$

The last equality is the same as $c^{12} = 2y$, which could be written as:

$$
\log_{c}2y = 12\quad\rightarrow\quad
\log_{c}2 + \log_{c}y = 12
$$

I really don't know haw to continue. I've managed to find a $\log_{c}y$, but I don't know what to do with the $\log_{c}2$. Either I took the wrong path, or I'm missing something that prevents me to finish this exercise.

Any hints are much welcome! Thanks in advance.

2518,2518,4017,Document count limit under folders,"We are trying to figure out what the library file count restriction is for items under a folder.

We can see here:

http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc262787(v=office.15).aspx#ListLibrary

Documents :: 30,000,000 per library >> You can create very large document libraries by nesting folders, or using standard views and site hierarchy. This value may vary depending on how documents and folders are organized, and by the type and size of documents stored.

Does that mean there is a file count limit of some sort under folders for a library?
",Sol Web Solutions,https://sharepoint.stackexchange.com/users/28364,"TL;DR - Stay under 5,000 items for the entire library to get 100% of functionality

In addition to the 30 million documents per library you also need to be aware of the limit of 5,000 items per ""view"". 

http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc262787(v=office.15).aspx#ListLibrary

This particular limit can be changed in on-premise but in SharePoint Online it cannot. This means that Microsoft does not recommend having more than 5,000 folders or documents within a single folder. You can continue to nest folders but any single folder should not have more than 5,000 direct children (items or folders).

That being said... you will find there are limitations putting more than 5,000 documents into a single library no matter how efficient your foldering structure. This is because certain operations will apply to all items below a certain level and those operations (if they affect more than 5,000 items) will be throttled.

In my experience this includes:

We can see here:

http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc262787(v=office.15).aspx#ListLibrary

Documents :: 30,000,000 per library >> You can create very large document libraries by nesting folders, or using standard views and site hierarchy. This value may vary depending on how documents and folders are organized, and by the type and size of documents stored.

Does that mean there is a file count limit of some sort under folders for a library?
","TL;DR - Stay under 5,000 items for the entire library to get 100% of functionality

In addition to the 30 million documents per library you also need to be aware of the limit of 5,000 items per ""view"". 

http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc262787(v=office.15).aspx#ListLibrary

This particular limit can be changed in on-premise but in SharePoint Online it cannot. This means that Microsoft does not recommend having more than 5,000 folders or documents within a single folder. You can continue to nest folders but any single folder should not have more than 5,000 direct children (items or folders).

That being said... you will find there are limitations putting more than 5,000 documents into a single library no matter how efficient your foldering structure. This is because certain operations will apply to all items below a certain level and those operations (if they affect more than 5,000 items) will be throttled.

In my experience this includes:


Adding a indexed property to the library that contains more than 5,000
Changing permissions on t he library and or folder that contains more than 5,000

There is no closed form expression for this. However, a more realistic goal is to have the ability to find the next larger element, $a_{n+1},$ in the list up to element $n,$ then the next one after that, and so on. This has been done. For general terminology, you want On Highly Composite Numbers by Jean-Louis Nicolas, pages 215-244 in a book called Ramanujan Revisited, edited by George Andrews et al, appearing in 1988.

Informatique theoretique 17, no. 3, 1983, pages 239-247.

The reason it is possible to do such a thing is that highly composite numbers bear some resemblance to superior highly composite numbers. S.H.C. numbers have the basic feature, nonincreasing exponents, but in addition the ratios of the exponents for distinct primes $p \neq q$ must approximate the outcome of Ramanujan's recipe.  Between consecutive S.H.C. numbers, one may find all the h.c. numbers as a sort of operations research problem. This is all, well, difficult. So it all depends on why this is important to you, and how important. The short version, meanwhile, is that you calculate the s.h.c larger than you current $a_n,$ calculate the h.c. numbers up that high, and take the smallest one that is a multiple of $a_n.$ If you need to go up an extra s.h.c number, so be it.

Note that finding the first s.h.c number which is a multiple of your fixed number $a_n$ is entirely straightforward, as for any given $p^e,$ one may find the first (largest) $\delta &gt; 0$ such that the s.h.c. number $N_\delta$ is divisible by $p^e.$ Do this for all primes that divide your fixed $a_n$ and there you have it.

4268,4268,6805,How to remember 10 last read articles with timestamp in session for a user in Codeigniter?,"I would like to make a PHP if condition code that will check if the last 10 articles or 10 minutes from the article reading by the user have already elapsed.

E.g. 

A user open a page with id = 235 (this id value is in the url localhost/article/235 )

and this id value will be saved in session with a current timestamp and maybe his IP address

Then he read another article and the same will happen.

I need to remember the clicked stuff for another ten clicks and then reset that only for the first row. E.g. after the 10th click the id and timestamp will not became 11th row but will replace the 1st row in the list.

The php condition in CodeIgniter will then check these values and will update the article hit counter value in the articles table and column counter like this:   

   $this-&gt;db-&gt;where('id', $id);
   $this-&gt;db-&gt;set('counter', 'counter+1', FALSE);
   $this-&gt;db-&gt;update('articles');


But before calling this code I need to make this check from the session?

How to do that?

I think storing e.g. 10 entries in the session with timestamps per user will be enough.

Just don't save the same page in the session twice.

And the condition will check the current timestamp with the saved one and if it is more than e.g. 10 minutes or the user have read/clicked another 10 articles it will allow the update counter php code.

I don't need to have this bulletproof. Just to disable the increment using browser's refresh button. 

So, if he wants to increment the counter he will need to wait ten minutes or read another 10 articles ;)

317,317,509,Why don't banks give access to all your transaction activity?,"In the era of big data, I find it surprising that banks and credit card companies only offer access to a ridiculously small number of transactions - often only your last 180 days, if that. The longest I've seen was 720 days going back. I suspect they do store everything, but intentionally limit access.

These transactions are text only, take up extremely little space, and storing an individual's lifetime worth of transaction would take less than 10MB of data; about the storage required by two MP3 files, and about 250k records per person per lifetime, if we generously assume everyone makes 10 transactions a day. But I'd be happy with only the last 10 years of transactions, so about 1MB per customer. One of the largest banks, JP Morgan Chase, has ~70MM credit card customers. That means 70TB of data for 10 years of records - hardly impressive for a corporation of that size, with $17B of net income in 2013, when 1TB of cloud storage costs $10 retail per month.

By comparison, would you put up with Gmail or any online email provider keeping only the most recent 120 days worth of email? (And emails do take a lot more space than transactions, are far more numerous, and have to be instantly retrievable.)

Storage requirements for transaction activity are trivial in an era where we're throwing around petabytes and zetabytes.

Is there a sound reason for banks not offering access to all your transactions, other than legacy software on their side?

Your browser is returning XML since it is sending ""Accepts: text\html"" as a header.  jQuery will resolve this issue as it uses application\json in the request (unless you specify otherwise).


So issue 2 is already fixed.  Issue 1 can be resolved by using JSONP.  You should just need to add ?callback=? to the end of your url.  However, read through the documentation on jQuery's site for a full overview.

Go to this URL and search the page for ""JSONP"" http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/

It was asked in 2009.  Only new and active questions should be migrated between Stack Exchange sites.

50,50,77,AES using derived keys / IVs. Does it introduce a weakness?,"I'm looking for an efficient way to encrypt multiple fields in a database with AES using a single global key, used throughout a large web application.

Obviously in order to re-use this key, a unique random IV is required for each field that is to be encrypted.

I'd rather not introduce more fields to the database to store each of these IVs, so the programatic approach seems to be to derive these IVs some how.

I'm toying with using either:

key = sha256(global_key + table_name)
iv = sha256(column_name + primary_key)


Or even simply:

key = global_key
iv = sha256(table_name + column_name + primary_key)


I'm leaning towards the former to generate per-table keys.

I've already read that the IVs do not need to be kept secret. So I'm working on the assumption that a derived key or IV (even if the algorithm becomes known), is no more insecure than any other non-secret IV, as long as the original key remains secret.

The question is:

Is there a fatal flaw in my approach? Am I introducing any serious weaknesses that, in the event that an adversary obtains a copy of the database, would make it easier for them to retrieve the plaintext data?

I realise that is potentially soliciting one word answers.

5482,5482,8702,Should I tell other interviewers where else I've interviewed?,"I am currently travelling for faculty interviews. Some professors and other interviewers have asked me where else I have interviewed. Should I tell interviewers where else I've interviewed?

Intuitively I would like to give them less information, but I also don't want to appear guarded and defensive as a person, either.
",Irwin,https://academia.stackexchange.com/users/5944,"If you don't want to disclose that, you can simply say: ""I'd rather not discuss this"", and you can look straight into your interviewer eyes with that. I've seen candidates do that; it may have looked harsh, but there's no obligation on the candidate's side to tell anything beyond the contents of the job talk.

You can also try to convert this into a joke like ""Enough to earn me a free roundtrip this year"". An American faculty should take that as a hint that you don't want to talk about it. An international faculty may need a more straight answer like the one I gave above. (I am talking about the US here as the largest academic market; in UK, as far as I understand, you won't have more than 30 minutes face time with the faculty of the hiring institution, and they probably have more important things to ask than the # of interviews you have.)

Having said that, you need to weight in the benefits of telling vs. not. For one thing, you may not have all the invitations out yet on your first fly-out, so you really don't know yet what other interviews you might have. On the other hand, by the time you reach your sixth destination (if you are lucky to get that many), the first place may already have told you, ""Sorry, we made the offer to somebody else"". So nominally you may have interviewed there, but really you won't get an offer from them.

Some professors and other interviewers asked me where I had interviewed. Should I tell the interviewer where I interviewed?,"If you don't want to disclose that, you can simply say: ""I'd rather not discuss this"", and you can look straight into your interviewer eyes with that. I've seen candidates do that; it may have looked harsh, but there's no obligation on the candidate's side to tell anything beyond the contents of the job talk.

You can also try to convert this into a joke like ""Enough to earn me a free roundtrip this year"". An American faculty should take that as a hint that you don't want to talk about it. An international faculty may need a more straight answer like the one I gave above. (I am talking about the US here as the largest academic market; in UK, as far as I understand, you won't have more than 30 minutes face time with the faculty of the hiring institution, and they probably have more important things to ask than the # of interviews you have.)

Having said that, you need to weight in the benefits of telling vs. not. For one thing, you may not have all the invitations out yet on your first fly-out, so you really don't know yet what other interviews you might have. On the other hand, by the time you reach your sixth destination (if you are lucky to get that many), the first place may already have told you, ""Sorry, we made the offer to somebody else"". So nominally you may have interviewed there, but really you won't get an offer from them.

As a bottom line, you need to do what others in your discipline do. You don't want to look like a fool in the environment where everybody keep their secrets by telling left and right about your choosing between Harvard and Stanford (and thus losing a chance to get a far more realistic offer from Alabama); and you don't want to look like a fool hinting at many undisclosed interviews when your adviser had told them that this is the only interview you have when they called him/her, or your other interviews were posted on a job market rumor website.

Second, note that the noun ""variable"" is implied in the prepositional phrase beginning with to, and in a few other places thereafter:

A variable so related to another [variable]...

Third, I think you may be getting tripped up by the adverb so, which is used in a nonintuitive way in this definition. It is used here in the sense of ""in such a way"" or ""in the manner indicated"":

A variable [that is] related to another [in such a way] that for each value assumed by one there is a value determined for the other.

This is roughly the same sense in which you use the word yourself: ""...only to fail to do so."" 

The reason it's confusing here is that although the word ""related"" is being used here as a verb in the past tense, ""related"" can be used as an adjective as well. And when we see the construction ""[noun] ([verb]) so [adjective],"" the word so is usually used in a different sense--that of an intensifier indicating a greatness of degree:

","@RBK: You first take a string, reverse it, then based on specific words you again reverse them.
I followed a slightly different approach of doing this. I take the string then reverse if required otherwise i copy the same word as it is. 

int main(int argc, char*argv[])
{
    char *p,st[]= ""hello world"";
    char buf[12]={0};
    char fstr[12]={0};
    int i=0,j=0,k=0,l=0;

    for(p=st;*p!='\0';p++){

        //Get the Word
        buf[i++] = *p;

        //Parse the Word    
        if(*p == ' ' || *(p+1) == '\0'){

            buf[i]='\0';
            j=i-1;
            i=0;        //reset counter

            if(k){      //reverse word and copy

                while(j&gt;=i){

                    fstr[l++]=buf[j--];

                }               

                k=0;        

            }
            else{       //copy same word

                while(i&lt;=j){

                    fstr[l++]=buf[i++];

",Shrouk Khan,https://stackoverflow.com/users/533631,"Since you said ""UNIX"", this uses TZ, but, TZ=[what goes here] You need to find out [what goes here] on your system.  It might be ""America/LosAngeles""  or one of several other strings for PST.
If your system is POSIX: TZ=PST8PST  is guaranteed to work.  But it may not be optimal.

Primitive non-production code assumes TZ is not currently in use.  This is in C, not C++ since your tag was C:

The problem here is that when the GMT time is less than 8 hours (for example, right now, the time there is 3AM in the morning), subtracting 8 hours from it does not work!

What is the proper way to get time at a different time zone in Unix?
","Since you said ""UNIX"", this uses TZ, but, TZ=[what goes here] You need to find out [what goes here] on your system.  It might be ""America/LosAngeles""  or one of several other strings for PST.
If your system is POSIX: TZ=PST8PST  is guaranteed to work.  But it may not be optimal.

Primitive non-production code assumes TZ is not currently in use.  This is in C, not C++ since your tag was C:

setenv(""TZ"", ""PST8PST"", 1);   // set TZ
tzset();                // recognize TZ
time_t lt=time(NULL);   //epoch seconds
struct tm *p=localtime(&amp;lt); // get local time struct tm
char tmp[80]={0x0};
strftime(tmp, 80, ""%c"", p);  // format time use format string, %c 
printf(""time and date PST: %s\n"", tmp); // display time and date

6033,6033,9576,Can a Floating Action Button morph be reverted?,"There are two specific examples in the Android Floating Action Button guidelines that explain how the button can morph into either new buttons, or a toolbar. 


  If the hallmark of the app is adding file types, a floating action

  contain related actions. In this example, the button lets the user

After the button has morphed, how does the user revert back to the previous single button mode?

As I understand it, the rest of the UI is not blocked after these buttons have morphed, so it's not clear how the user can hide the new buttons or revert the morphed shape if they decide not to go through with the new action.

You've put a boundary in between yourself and the third party interface, but then you've turned around and coded against an implementation. We should code against interfaces whenever possible.

Original had,

Relay = 12V coil voltage


Mine has,

Q1 = BC547B
Relay = 5v coil voltage


Q1) Is that an acceptable conversion ? 

Note: The BC547B has Vcbo:50V, Vceo:45V, Vebo:6V, where-as the BC548 in original circuit has Vcbo:30V, Vceo:30V, Vebo:5V, rest of the parameters being pretty same as per datasheet (hFE:220-450).

The relay is the SPDT PCB-mount kind (rated for 10A @230VAC), also called ""sugar cube"".



Q2) The load I am trying to drive is resistive (60W 220VAC incandescent lamp). What changes might I need if I would like to drive loads like --


Fluorescent lamp
Fan (220VAC, 60W)
1HP Water pump (220VAC, 800W) -- One thought is to use higher current rated (e.g. 30A) relay. But, I think I need to worry about EM feedback which might cause arcing and destroy the EM relay.


Q3) Right now I am making this on a veroboard (el-cheapo phenolic kinds). While I understand that this may be sufficient for the lamp/fan control, I am wondering if I need something better for higher loads, s.a. the Water-pump control ? What is the minimum gauge wire to be used for this purpose ? What kind of connectors (terminal blocks) could be used ?

DO NOT USE  MAINS AC ON STRIP BOARD / VEROBOARD
that your days may be long on the face of the land. 


This is in fact doable with reasonable safety with proper care.
 BUT learning what ""proper"" means in this context is something best arrived at by some years of general experience. Destruction of equipment and / or life is easily achieved by applying AC mains to stuff and to people and it should not be dealt with lightly, ever.

Wire the mains wiring to the relay contacts  directly using appropriate connectors or hard soldering as appropriate.l If the relay is mounted on the veroboard, leave largish full holes in the veroboard around the contacts ad ALWAYS provide means of preventing user or other contact with live mains. 


Note that I said above  IF the relay is mounted on the veroboard,..."". 

I do not and did not recommend it.   

That was just for people who like to ignore good advice and to live dangerously. Better not to do it till you have lived longer and prospered somewhat. As you know, wax on wings tends to melt when flying too close to sunwards and mains shocks can be as lethal.    

If you MUST do this
(1) use high temperature wings when flying close to sun  - TEFLON may help.
(2) 8mm / 0.33 inch gaps all round MINIMUM between contact and anything else on board.
A GAP is a hole with air in it !!!!
Veroboard and similar  = Phenolic board = PAPER plus a resin.
Relying on paper board to not track, carbonise, absorb moisture or make deals with Murphy
is placing your life at risk.
Or somebody else's.  

Leaving an AIR gap is the equivalent to an 8mm creepage distance which is what most regulatory authorities prescribe in similar cases 

Leaving 8mm of Veroboard as an AC mains barrier is like tossing a coin 10 times and calling heads. You will probably get at least one head and would be surprised when you didn't.
The difference is, with a coin you have a silly look on your face when you fail, whereas with AC mains you may end up with a silly look on your dead face. 




(Q1)  Your driver is good EXCEPT 


The base drive resistor is far too low.  ee below.
they  have used a very non standard and confusing symbol for the output contacts. I assume this is a SPDT = sngle pole double throw (= single changeover ) contact with isolation between output circuit and 5V. 


The transistor may or may not be OK depending on coil current - see below.
 You do not specify the coil current, but say it is 200 mA.
 Icollector = Icoil = 200 mA
 Ibase >> to > Icollector/Beta = 200 mA / 200 = 1 mA 

I base = (Vdrive - Vbe) / Rbase or
 Rbase = (Vdrive - Vbe ) / Ibase.

For Vdrive = 5V,
 Rbase = (5-0.7) / 0.001 = 4300 ohms.

A resistor that gives substantially more than 1 mA is desirable 9allows beta to be low etc). So R1 = 1k = 1000 ohms would be fine.

Even with say 3V drive.
 Ib = (Vdrive - Vbe)/R1 = (3-0.7)/1000 = 2.3 mA.
 With a Beta of 200 Icmax = beta x Ib = 200 x 2.3 = 460 mA.
 If relay current &lt; 200 mA then 1K is stioll good.
 If relay current is higher the value of R1 MAY need adjusting - probably not.



(Q2) Your basic circuit is good for load power at any sensible level, subject to suitable coil drive power AND possibly some sort of snubbing of the contacts.

The relay or contactor has to have contacts rated for the load carried - which will be in the relevant datasheet. 

A ""snubber"" is a circuit designed to absorb transient AC energy which may othewise cause contact arcing when the contacts open. It usually consists of a series C and R such that the C limits the current to a low value in the R under normal conditions but when high voltage and/or high frequency transients occur the R current and dissipation increase and absorb the transient energy.

There have been various other stack exchange questions re snubbers eg
 here &amp; here &amp; here &amp; here
 and there is lots of on-web resources eg
 Wikipedia
 Good intro
 Good. Slightly more complex  

Good - with online calculator



Non dissipative version (from above link)



and manufacturer of relays etc will often specify what is needed for their product with a given load. 



[Q3} Wire size. Terminal block size.

Too general for easy answer.
 Many wire tables are available re current/gauge.
 ""As thick as you can sensibly handle with no great effort"" is usually enough.
 Occasionally you need thick enough to be hard or annoying, but that is usually at low voltage, not at mains voltages.



Transistor selection:

The BC547b is rated at only 100 mA Ic. Datasheet here
 This may be OK BUT a much better transistor is available which is often as cheap and sometimes cheaper.
 This is the BC337 (NPN). BC327 (PNP). Also availabl in SOT23 SMD as BC817/BC807.  I use these as my standard ""jellybean"" transistors. They will meet almost any need that you'd sensibly use them for, and in most cases a better transistor is not available without paying a lot more. 

These are available in several beta ranges. I always buy the highest beta bin range = BC337-40 which has beta in the range 250 - 600 with mean of 400.
 BC337-40 etc 800 mA*, 50V.
 (* rated current varies with supplier 600 - 800 mA typical). 800 mA in datasheet cited). 

Digikey has them at $US0.14 / 100 here
 Keep watch a you will sometimes ee them for far less - maybe under 5 cents in 100's.

Creepage / Mains clearance

Phenolic PCB has its specialist uses but really really should be avoided for most purposes. The savings in cost are not vast compared to eg FR4 fibreglass. Phenolics main advantages are cost (minor gain) and ""punchability"". It is amenable to having holes or slots etc cut by punching tather than drilling or routing. In general use it is a nasty PCB material. It break and shatters. It risks breakdown. It is not fire or moisture proof. Caveat emptor!

Excellent creepage &amp; clearance page here

Excellent TI power supply safety design paper here  - Image from this  shown below. 



Excellent creepage &amp; celarance page here.

Note they say: 


When designing a switch-mode power supply for use in information technology (IT) equipment, a typical rule of thumb is to allow an 8-mm creepage distance between primary and secondary circuits, and a 4-mm distance between primary and ground. If these dimensions are allowed for during the design stage, there is a high probability (95%) that no failure will occur with respect to creepage or clearance when the final product is submitted for test.


All the above are liable to lead you to conclude that my advice was too conservative and that you can use lower limits with Vero board. It wasn't. You can't with any safety.

Is there any good way to achieve it?,"Their are 3 ways to get this done.


Export from 2010 and import in 2013(with little tricks)
Content Database Migration
3rd party tools.


Method 1.


Export the list from SharePoint 2010 using either the Central
Administration or PowerShell (Export-SPWeb). In the Central
Administration, go to Backup and Restore > Export a site or list.
Choose your list, and click Start Export
Copy the exported list (.cmp file) to your desktop and change the extension to .cab. You can then extract it using a software like WinRar. 
Open the SystemData.XML file with an editor like NotePad++ and change the version from 14.0.0.0 to 15.0.0.0 , and the build version from your 14.0.x.x to 15.0.x.x (depending on the build you have on both your farms). Here is a screenshot with before and afte
Now we have to repackage it as a .cab file. I used a software called CabPack. Select your Source and Destination. Change the CabinetNameTemplate if you want, and click on OK.
Change the extension from .cab to .cmp
Copy the .cmp file back on the network share or directly on the SharePoint 2013 Server.
Open SharePoint 2013 Management Shell as an administrator. Run this command by changing the parameters of course! Import-SPWeb -Identity http://teamsite.vlad.local/ -Path \sp2010-itest\Exports\MyCusttomList.cmp -Verbose
Open up your SharePoint Site and your list should be there


source:http://absolute-sharepoint.com/2013/08/how-to-move-a-list-from-sharepoint-2010-to-sharepoint-2013.html

Method 2) 
I am sure you already have you 2013 farm up and running.


Backup the Content Database of the Site Collection in which the list
is. (SharePoint 2010)
Create a Temporary Web Application in the SharePoint 2013 Farm.
Run SharePoint 2013 Management Shell as an administrator, and run the
following command to dismount the content database:

Get-SPContentDatabase -WebApplication http://sitename.com | Dismount-SPContentDatabase
Restore the Backup you took in Step 1, on the SQL Instance hosting
your SharePoint 2013 Farm. Make sure you give the farm account
db_owner permissions on the database.
In the SharePoint 2013 Management Shell, run the following command.

Mount-SPContentDatabase MyDatabase -WebApplication http://sitename.com
Navigate to the Site Collection, and if you didn’t have too many
development and custom things done, it should open no problem. Make
sure the list you want to export is ok.

660,660,1049,Oracle.DataAccess.Client.BulkCopy - trying to cast varchar2 as number when it shouldn't,"I have a table (A)  that includes a column named confirmation_number.  It is defined as a varchar2(30) and contains something like SMITERI-2012-02-31-4567.

I have another table (B) that also includes a column named confirmation_number, and it is also a varchar2(30).

I have a stored procedure that extracts the data from A, performing some transformation on it, and it includes the confirmation number column.  

I use C# and ODP.Net to run the stored procedure and load a DataTable with it.  I then perform some additional transformations.  However, I never touch the confirmation number column.

Finally, I create an OracleBulkCopy object, set the column mappings, tell it to update Table B, and call loader.WriteToServer(dataTable).

I am getting the following error:

Input string was not in a correct format.
   at System.Number.StringToNumber(String str, NumberStyles options, NumberBuffer&amp; number, NumberFormatInfo info, Boolean parseDecimal)
   at System.Number.ParseInt64(String value, NumberStyles options, NumberFormatInfo numfmt)
   at Oracle.DataAccess.Client.OracleBulkCopy.PerformBulkCopy()


I have confirmed that the error occurs on the confirmation_number column, because if I don't load that column, the dataload succeeds.

Any ideas why the BulkCopy would be trying to turn a varchar(2) into a Number?

EDIT:
I have confirmed the following relevant issues:


This is happening on more than just the confirmation number.  This
appears to only be a problem on string columns - whether from a
string to a string or a string to an integer. 
This doesn't happen on every varchar2 column - last name and first name have no trouble.
This happens both on columns that have no null values (confirmation
number) and on columns that may have null values (street type).
Investigating the contents of the datatable at the moment before the
loader begins shows no difference in column definition between those
that successfully go in and those that do not.


I'm beginning to wonder if there's a bug in the BulkCopy itself and if I need to do this load using another utility.

",user158017,https://stackoverflow.com/users/158017,"It seems that BulkCopy does some sort of type conversion based on the declared types of the columns in the DataTable that it is given.

If you print the Column.DataType.ToString() for the columns that are causing issues, there is a good chance that you will see a type other than the one which the database is expecting.

You can create a new data table from the using old one but explicitly change Column.DataType of the troubling columns to be of the type that the database expects. 

public DataTable potentialFix(DataTable dt) {    
    DataTable newTable = new DataTable(dt.TableName);

    //define columns for the new table with type string (or whatever type you want)
    foreach (DataColumn dc in dt.Columns)

5039,5039,8020,Should you optimize mobile experiences based on individual handedness?,"In abbood's question ""How to implement a stack exchange style voting for mobile?"" he answers his own question with the following mock-up:



My immediate thought was that the up-vote control was on the wrong side. Why? Because my feeling is that up-votes happen more often than down-votes (because something not interesting is not worth wasting a click on) and the primary action on mobile should be on the left.

But that got me thinking. I'm a lefty, so when I hold my phone (in my left hand) it's easier to reach the control on the left, hence my thought to put the primary control on the left side. But for a righty, it would be easier to reach the right-sided control.

This may be a trivial example, but if you have a UI that requires a lot of tap-based input it could make quite a difference on which side the most-used action is located.

My question: should you optimize mobile experiences based on individual handedness? Has there been any research on this and is this practically possible?

Adding a setting which mirrors controls seems possible, but is there a way to detect this and do this automatically? Using the accelerometer perhaps, or maybe by measuring the speed to click depending on distance from either side?
",vincent.io,https://ux.stackexchange.com/users/12741,"(EDIT: The question was clarified a bit since my first response)

I'm not aware of any research into handedness-based layouts. It sounds like an interesting idea and, as a lefty, I'd fall all over any app that catered to my inability to use my right hand like a normal person. However, I would caution that from a practical standpoint, you could probably not optimize for handedness in an automated fashion. To see why, let's suppose you used the accelerometer and were able to detect the hand being used 100% of the time. Perfect, except that you're measuring the wrong thing! The hand using the mobile device is not necessarily the dominant hand. Ever use your phone with your off-hand? Bam! Your app's interface is completely backwards, hindering rather than helping your user. In other words, handedness does not determine behavior.

So the best, most consistent way to do this would be to create a setting and send your lefties there. Maybe you could use the accelerometer for this purpose, for example, ""it looks like you may be left-handed, would you like to switch to a left-handed layout?"" I do not know the feasibility of using the accelerometer for this purpose, but it seems like it would not be trivial.

In my original response, I talked about the value of avoiding interactions with an obvious handedness, which I think still applies. (A) Your customers might not want to or know how to change settings (good defaults are important!) and (B) you'd make the job of customizing your UI that much easier. Take the iPhone's slide to unlock or slide to power down as an example.



As a lefty, this action was almost impossible for me to perform one-handed because it meant tucking my thumb in close to the left edge and pushing out. More than once, I have dropped my iPhone attempting to perform this action. This interaction clearly favors the right-handed. Now compare to the Windows Phone power down:



There's no clear handedness to this interaction. It works equally well for righties and lefties. I now use a Windows Phone.

It saddens me to say that if you absolutely must design an interaction with an obvious handedness, you should probably favor righties. They make up approximately 90% of the population.

  Love the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul and
  with all your strength.  Deuteronomy 6:5 NIV

This is the first and greatest commandment. I think that it's pretty ironic that nobody can answer what this means, considering the biggest forgivable sin is probably breaking the first and most important commandment.

  hearts, their consciences also bearing witness, and their thoughts
  sometimes accusing them and at other times even defending them.)


The commandments and laws of God are no longer obeyed by one nation, but instead these things are written on the individual believers hearts. So that each believer may be governed by the spirit and not by the flesh.

To love God with all of your heart is to allow all of His laws to govern you.

God tells us that we need not just SAY that we are Christian, but actually BE Christian. The parable of the two farmers sons is the perfect example of this. Jesus gives two examples of Children that were told to go work in the field. On said ok but didn't go. The other said no, but then eventually went.

4227,4227,6741,Should you optimize mobile experiences based on individual handedness?,"In abbood's question ""How to implement a stack exchange style voting for mobile?"" he answers his own question with the following mock-up:



My immediate thought was that the up-vote control was on the wrong side. Why? Because my feeling is that up-votes happen more often than down-votes (because something not interesting is not worth wasting a click on) and the primary action on mobile should be on the left.

But that got me thinking. I'm a lefty, so when I hold my phone (in my left hand) it's easier to reach the control on the left, hence my thought to put the primary control on the left side. But for a righty, it would be easier to reach the right-sided control.

This may be a trivial example, but if you have a UI that requires a lot of tap-based input it could make quite a difference on which side the most-used action is located.

My question: should you optimize mobile experiences based on individual handedness? Has there been any research on this and is this practically possible?

Adding a setting which mirrors controls seems possible, but is there a way to detect this and do this automatically? Using the accelerometer perhaps, or maybe by measuring the speed to click depending on distance from either side?
",vincent.io,https://ux.stackexchange.com/users/12741,"On a larger system level, yes we should.

Unlike PC's where it is just as easy to click on any part of the screen, the same is not true on a smartphone.  Most people are right handed, and are likely to hold the phone in their right hand and use their thumb when they are only using one hand. 

That makes the area of the phone swept from the bottom left to the top right the easiest to reach, and should be the area that is most used.  

It is also largely why this area is favoured in both iOS and Android design patterns for the phone (bottom left) and action buttons (usually top right).

Edit:
Now considering that applications already are geared for right handed people, I would argue that you should not optimise for individual handedness.  Quite simply because even left handed people will be used to right handed optimised smartphones and apps, so changing that will simply break the paradigm that they are used to.

Example 1 does not properly show any voltage source as Vref - it can come from ADVREF or VDD_MAIN
Example 2 has a potential divider (R307 and R306) forming a voltage that is buffered by the OP-AMP. This uses a voltage reference chip (a 4.096 shunt regulator) across the potential divider to keep things fairly stable if the power rail (VCC_P5V0) moves around.
Example 3 uses a 3V reference (or 3.3V aka VCC33) directly connectable to the VREF pin.

",boxofchalk1,https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/57046,"This is really physical chemistry, but since the question is here:

When you electrolyse solutions you need to consider secondary reactions that might take place at the electrodes. For example if you produced sodium at the cathode it would immediately react with water to produce Na$^+$ and hydrogen. Therefore the cathode produces H$_2$ not sodium metal.

Likewise, if the salt solution is dilute the anode produces oxygen. So the net result is that you are splitting the water into hydrogen and oxygen, and as the water is removed over time the concentration of the sodium chloride will get higher and the conductivity of the solution will increase.

However as the concentration of NaCl increases, the reaction at the anode changes and starts producing chlorine instead of oxygen. This produces sodium hydroxide in the cell, which means the concentration of NaCl decreases and the concentration of sodium hydroxide increases. The molar conductivity of NaOH is greater than the molar conductivity of NaCl, so as before the overall conductivity carries on increasing with time.

4393,4393,6982,Various flavours of infinitesimals,"I'm not sure if this is a soft question, and whether it may be too broad or, on the contrary, too localized. Well, in Mathematics the concept of ""infinitesimal"" has been of extreme importance for centuries.
The present mathematical tecnology allows one, according to the context, to formalize this notion in several ways:


Differential geometry. The classical epsilon-delta formalism of limits in elementary analysis leads to the concept of first-order (or $n$-th order) approximation in Calculus, hence to many standard notions in differential geometry: the differential of a map between smooth manifolds, jets of a map, tangent vectors, differential forms, and Riemannian metrics.
Algebraic geometry. The lack of a useful notion of convergence of sequences due to the coarseness of Zariski topology prevents us from using epsilon-delta arguments to define ""infinitesimals"". But then one retains the notion of first-order (or $n$-th order) ""approximation"" in a more formal way, e.g. by means of universal properties of modules and derivations (Kahler differentials...), and that of ""infinitesimal space"" e.g. by means of local Artinian $\Bbbk$-algebras, and of ""infinitesimal neighbourhood"" e.g. by completion of local rings, formal schemes etc. (But after all the algebro geometric perspective is just a high brow way of doing the formal derivative of polynomials, which coincides with the ""topological one"" once we work over $\mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{C}$)
Synthetic differential geometry. More recently some mathematicians are exploring the realm of synthetic differential geometry, of which I know nothing except that it kind of unifies the perspectives of the previous two approaches and uses relevant amounts of category theory (please correct me if I'm not being correct). 
Non-standard analysis. The concept of infinitesimal element is of course fundamental in non-standard analysis, where the field $\mathbb{R}$ and the use of epsilon-delta arguments is replaced by the introduction of the field ${}^* \mathbb{R}$ of hyperreal numbers, which hosts several hierarchies of infinitesimals (as well as ""infinite elements"").
Noncommutative geometry. According to A.Connes (in his book Noncommutative Geometry there's a paragraph on a ""Quantized calculus"") given an infinite dimensional separable Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$ and a certain operator $F$ on it, compact operators on $\mathcal{H}$ with characteristic values such that $\mu_n=O(n^{-\alpha})$, $n\to\infty$, can be interpreted as ""infinitesimals of order $\alpha$"", while the differential of a ""complex variable"" (read ""operator on $\mathcal{H}$"") $f$ is just defined to be the commutator $[F,f]$.


At the risk of seeing my question closed as too vague (""not a real question""), it would be my curiosity to know: 


  Is there a theory that encompasses all the above instances of ""infinitesimals"" within a unique formal picture? Or, on the contrary, are some of the above notions of infinitesimals inherently specific to their field and embody formalizations of different heuristic notions? [A situation as in the second question occurs with the notion of ""infinity"": it seems to me there's almost no deep relation between the infinity as in $\lim_{n\to\infty}$ and the infinite cardinals of Cantor]

",Qfwfq,https://mathoverflow.net/users/4721,"I don't know of the Connes calculus, but the others (including nonstandard analysis &agrave; la Robinson) have been brought under a common framework using models of synthetic differential geometry. However: it is important to point out that the infinitesimals used in algebraic geometry (for jet bundles, etc.) are nilpotent infinitesimals, whereas the infinitesimals used in nonstandard analysis are invertible. So in a sense the answer to the question is, ""yes and no"", but I'm going to concentrate here on the ""yes"". 

This is explored in Models for Smooth Infinitesimal Analysis by Moerdijk and Reyes, which I recommend. This book can be read as ""applied sheaf theory"" or ""applied Grothendieck topos theory"", where the art is to choose a site (small category + covering sieves) judiciously to achieve several aims at once. In many of the models, one takes the underlying category of the site to be something like affine spectra of commutative rings, except one is not dealing with commutative rings exactly, but with richer algebraic structures called $C^\infty$-rings. The formal definition of these is in terms of a Lawvere algebraic theory which allows one to apply not just polynomial operations but more general operations based on $C^\infty$ functions. So the underlying category of the site in these models is the opposite of finitely generated $C^\infty$-rings, which Moerdijk and Reyes call $\mathbb{L}$ (for ""locus""). 

The representing object which gives the locus of invertible infinitesimals is the spectrum of the $C^\infty$-ring given by $C^\infty$ functions $\mathbb{R} - \{0\} \to \mathbb{R}$, modulo the ideal of functions that vanish on some neighborhood of $0$, aka the $C^\infty$ ring of germs at $0$. This is really not much different from nonstandard infinitesimals: usually infinitesimal elements are thought of in some way as germs of functions at infinity, i.e., of functions $\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ modulo those which vanish for sufficiently large $x$ (compare here the infinitesimals of Du Bois-Reymond and Hardy). Here Moerdijk and Reyes use $0$ instead of $\infty$. Either way, there are nonarchimedean elements, i.e., nonzero elements less than any $1/n$ in absolute value. 

[In nonstandard analysis, one typically refines this idea by considering germs of functions $\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ at an ""ideal point at infinity"", i.e., at a non-principal ultrafilter $U$ on $\mathbb{R}$, or alternatively germs of functions $\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$ at a non-principal ultrafilter $U$ on $\mathbb{N}$. The more familiar buzzword here is ""ultrapower"", but see this MO answer by Fran&ccedil;ois Dorais, where the implicit message is that an ultrapower along $U$ is really the same as taking a stalk at $U$. (I call $U$ an ""ideal point at infinity"" because we can think of a non-principal ultrafilter $U$ on $\mathbb{N}$ as a point in the fiber over $\infty$ with respect to the canonical continuous map $\beta(\mathbb{N}) \to \mathbb{N} \cup \{\infty\}$, from the Stone-Cech compactification of $\mathbb{N}$ to the one-point compactification of $\mathbb{N}$.)] 

On the other hand, a typical representing object for nilpotent infinitesimals is the spectrum of the $C^\infty$-ring of functions $\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ modulo the ideal of squares of elements which vanish at $0$. The ""internal hom"" represented by this spectrum gives the tangent bundle functor, and other jet bundles can be similarly represented, by using $C^\infty$-rings with different types of nilpotent elements. 

The tricky part of all this is to get the right notion of covering sieves, i.e., of sheaves w.r.t. a Grothendieck topology, to achieve disparate aims. One aim would be to embed the usual category of manifolds fully and faithfully in the category of sheaves, so as to preserve ""good colimits"", such as a manifold $M$ obtained as a colimit along an open covering of $M$. A different aim would be to arrange the topology so that the locus of invertible infinitesimals, as a presheaf on the site category $\mathbb{L}$, is a sheaf w.r.t. the topology.

Well, in Mathematics the concept of ""infinitesimal"" has been of extreme importance for centuries.
The present mathematical tecnology allows one, according to the context, to formalize this notion in several ways:


Differential geometry. The classical epsilon-delta formalism of limits in elementary analysis leads to the concept of first-order (or $n$-th order) approximation in Calculus, hence to many standard notions in differential geometry: the differential of a map between smooth manifolds, jets of a map, tangent vectors, differential forms, and Riemannian metrics.
Algebraic geometry. The lack of a useful notion of convergence of sequences due to the coarseness of Zariski topology prevents us from using epsilon-delta arguments to define ""infinitesimals"". But then one retains the notion of first-order (or $n$-th order) ""approximation"" in a more formal way, e.g. by means of universal properties of modules and derivations (Kahler differentials...), and that of ""infinitesimal space"" e.g. by means of local Artinian $\Bbbk$-algebras, and of ""infinitesimal neighbourhood"" e.g. by completion of local rings, formal schemes etc. (But after all the algebro geometric perspective is just a high brow way of doing the formal derivative of polynomials, which coincides with the ""topological one"" once we work over $\mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{C}$)
Synthetic differential geometry. More recently some mathematicians are exploring the realm of synthetic differential geometry, of which I know nothing except that it kind of unifies the perspectives of the previous two approaches and uses relevant amounts of category theory (please correct me if I'm not being correct). 
Non-standard analysis. The concept of infinitesimal element is of course fundamental in non-standard analysis, where the field $\mathbb{R}$ and the use of epsilon-delta arguments is replaced by the introduction of the field ${}^* \mathbb{R}$ of hyperreal numbers, which hosts several hierarchies of infinitesimals (as well as ""infinite elements"").
Noncommutative geometry. According to A.Connes (in his book Noncommutative Geometry there's a paragraph on a ""Quantized calculus"") given an infinite dimensional separable Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$ and a certain operator $F$ on it, compact operators on $\mathcal{H}$ with characteristic values such that $\mu_n=O(n^{-\alpha})$, $n\to\infty$, can be interpreted as ""infinitesimals of order $\alpha$"", while the differential of a ""complex variable"" (read ""operator on $\mathcal{H}$"") $f$ is just defined to be the commutator $[F,f]$.


At the risk of seeing my question closed as too vague (""not a real question""), it would be my curiosity to know: 


  Is there a theory that encompasses all the above instances of ""infinitesimals"" within a unique formal picture? Or, on the contrary, are some of the above notions of infinitesimals inherently specific to their field and embody formalizations of different heuristic notions? [A situation as in the second question occurs with the notion of ""infinity"": it seems to me there's almost no deep relation between the infinity as in $\lim_{n\to\infty}$ and the infinite cardinals of Cantor]

","I don't know of the Connes calculus, but the others (including nonstandard analysis &agrave; la Robinson) have been brought under a common framework using models of synthetic differential geometry. However: it is important to point out that the infinitesimals used in algebraic geometry (for jet bundles, etc.) are nilpotent infinitesimals, whereas the infinitesimals used in nonstandard analysis are invertible. So in a sense the answer to the question is, ""yes and no"", but I'm going to concentrate here on the ""yes"". 

This is explored in Models for Smooth Infinitesimal Analysis by Moerdijk and Reyes, which I recommend. This book can be read as ""applied sheaf theory"" or ""applied Grothendieck topos theory"", where the art is to choose a site (small category + covering sieves) judiciously to achieve several aims at once. In many of the models, one takes the underlying category of the site to be something like affine spectra of commutative rings, except one is not dealing with commutative rings exactly, but with richer algebraic structures called $C^\infty$-rings. The formal definition of these is in terms of a Lawvere algebraic theory which allows one to apply not just polynomial operations but more general operations based on $C^\infty$ functions. So the underlying category of the site in these models is the opposite of finitely generated $C^\infty$-rings, which Moerdijk and Reyes call $\mathbb{L}$ (for ""locus""). 

The representing object which gives the locus of invertible infinitesimals is the spectrum of the $C^\infty$-ring given by $C^\infty$ functions $\mathbb{R} - \{0\} \to \mathbb{R}$, modulo the ideal of functions that vanish on some neighborhood of $0$, aka the $C^\infty$ ring of germs at $0$. This is really not much different from nonstandard infinitesimals: usually infinitesimal elements are thought of in some way as germs of functions at infinity, i.e., of functions $\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ modulo those which vanish for sufficiently large $x$ (compare here the infinitesimals of Du Bois-Reymond and Hardy). Here Moerdijk and Reyes use $0$ instead of $\infty$. Either way, there are nonarchimedean elements, i.e., nonzero elements less than any $1/n$ in absolute value. 

[In nonstandard analysis, one typically refines this idea by considering germs of functions $\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ at an ""ideal point at infinity"", i.e., at a non-principal ultrafilter $U$ on $\mathbb{R}$, or alternatively germs of functions $\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$ at a non-principal ultrafilter $U$ on $\mathbb{N}$. The more familiar buzzword here is ""ultrapower"", but see this MO answer by Fran&ccedil;ois Dorais, where the implicit message is that an ultrapower along $U$ is really the same as taking a stalk at $U$. (I call $U$ an ""ideal point at infinity"" because we can think of a non-principal ultrafilter $U$ on $\mathbb{N}$ as a point in the fiber over $\infty$ with respect to the canonical continuous map $\beta(\mathbb{N}) \to \mathbb{N} \cup \{\infty\}$, from the Stone-Cech compactification of $\mathbb{N}$ to the one-point compactification of $\mathbb{N}$.)] 

On the other hand, a typical representing object for nilpotent infinitesimals is the spectrum of the $C^\infty$-ring of functions $\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ modulo the ideal of squares of elements which vanish at $0$. The ""internal hom"" represented by this spectrum gives the tangent bundle functor, and other jet bundles can be similarly represented, by using $C^\infty$-rings with different types of nilpotent elements.

4108,4108,6558,Intuition Behind a Decimal Representation with Catalan Numbers,"From $0 = 0.5 - 0.5 = 0.5 - \sqrt{0.25}$, we can adjust the subtrahend slightly to obtain

$$0.5 - \sqrt{0.249} = 0.001\ 001\ 002\ 005\ 014\ 042\ldots$$

where the decimal representation contains the first few Catalan numbers: $1, 1, 2, 5, 14, 42

We can see even more Catalan numbers (albeit spaced apart with more $0$s) by using more $9$s. 

(For example, check the decimal representation of $0.5 - \sqrt{0.24999999999}$.)

My question is not how to show this formally; it is a straightforward problem to show how one derives, e.g., the decimal representation given above. (I'll include a derivation below for anyone who doesn't want to think this through her/himself.)

Instead, my question is: why would it make sense, intuitively, for the Catalan numbers to show up in these decimal representations?



Derivation:

Recall that the generating function for the Catalan numbers $c(x)$ satisfies $c(x) = 1 + xc(x)^2$. Rearranging, we find that $c(x) = \frac{2}{1 + \sqrt{1 - 4x}}.$ Then

$$\sum_{n = 0}^{\infty}\frac{C_n}{10^{3n + 3}} = \frac{1}{1000}\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{C_n}{1000^{n}} = x \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}C_n x^n = xc(x) = \frac{2x}{1 + \sqrt{1 - 4x}},$$

where we have simplified our computations by letting $x = \frac{1}{1000}$.

Evaluating at this value of $x$ yields $0.5 - \sqrt{0.249}$.

The interface you are using to create the buffers IFeatureCursorBuffer2 creates buffers for selected features.  Your point that you create based upon the users button click is not a feature but a graphic which you are adding to the graphics container of the map. A Feature is essentially a row in a table or featureclass.

As you are adding your point as a graphic I assume the buffer you want to create will also end up as a graphic. Use the interface ITopologicalOperator and it's method Buffer to create a polygon then do as you did with your point, create a graphic element.

I see some major flaws in this thinking. 

First, it doesn't take into account how the engine is built. For instance, the difference between a turbo charged engine and a normally aspirated engine. In order to get the performance out of a purpose built turbo charged engine, you lower the compression ratio to allow the turbo to produce more boost with less fear of pre-detonation. This allows for great HP output with out the damaging affects of the dread ""knock"". Yet, a turbo charged engine will absorb a greater amount of abuse.

I think it's vitally important to show your gratitude for good answers and perhaps scorn for bad so votes act as a more accurate measure of answer quality.

Apologies if I have veered slightly off-topic here; however I think this point is related and rather important.

",Joe Z.,https://crypto.stackexchange.com/users/4572,"Well, it's moderately difficult; you couldn't use that as a security assumption; however, it would be too difficult to expect someone to solve during an active protocol.  There's no nonobvious trick to it; the two methods at your disposal would be:


Select random plaintexts with the first 32 bits as $S_1$; encrypt them with key $K$, and check to see if the last 32 bits of the ciphertext happen to be $S_2$
Select random ciphertexts with the last 32 bits as $S_2$; decrypt them with key $K$, and check to see if the first 32 bits of the plaintext happen to be $S_1$


Either approach will take an expected $2^{32}$ random trials before success; at 1 $\mu$sec per AES operation (quite conservative; modern CPUs typically can do several times as fast as that), we're looking at perhaps an hour or two.

Perhaps you were hoping there was some clever way to take advantage of the partly known plaintext/ciphertext; it doesn't work out.  For example, you might be hoping to translate the AES cipher into a large series of boolean operations (with the known key, and known 32 bits of plaintext and ciphertexts), and solve the resulting set of equations.  However, AES has a fairly quick 'avalanche'; very quickly (within two rounds), all the internal bits will depend on all the unknown bits in subtle ways; the resulting set of equations will not have an easier solution than just trying various combinations of the 96 bits on one side (which is effectively what the straight-forward solutions do)

",LinuxPenseur,https://serverfault.com/users/62792,"You don't mention which brand of Linux you're using.

RedHat (and Centos, and perhaps even Fedora) uses the /etc/sysconfig/network file to determine the host's name.

","You don't mention which brand of Linux you're using.

RedHat (and Centos, and perhaps even Fedora) uses the /etc/sysconfig/network file to determine the host's name.  Then, using the host's name, it determines the IP address of the host using the normal naming system (as given in /etc/resolv.conf), which in practice means that you should have an IP-to-name mapping in /etc/hosts.

3266,3266,5204,Best way to organize models with multiple meshes and textures?,"I have character models which have different parts, ex: upper body, head, lower body; each part is a separate mesh in the same model. Each part has several textures associated with it (diffuse, normal, etc).

I'm wondering if there is a best practice for associating the textures with the meshes, given a .obj file as the model, for example, and .tga files for the textures.

So for instance, making sure the head textures get mapped on to the head object.

One way would be having a separate file for each mesh, and using the file names to associate them with their textures, but that seems impractical.

Is there a nice, clean way to do this, which is both easy to program (importing and rendering) and easy for the artist?
",cloudhead,https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/users/8899,"Many typical source formats already do what you're asking for in data.  The format will contain a list of N materials and a list of M meshes with a mapping for each particular mesh to the material it uses.  Your converter can convert these directly to your in-engine format.

Other formats make use of external references, which is handy if you have multiple meshes that share materials.  The format is again usually the same: the format has a list of N material references and M meshes and maps each mesh to its material.

In engine, you would either use a reference/pointer/handle to each material for each mesh or use an ID system.  You load your optimized format which would likely use a reference system as in the previous paragraph.  When you load foo.model you'd get a hierarchy of M meshes each with an identiier of the material resource to load.  You load the material if not already loaded and attach the handle/id to the mesh.

For example, you might have the files:

/asset/material/stone.mat
/asset/material/steel.mat
/asset/model/gargoyle.model
/asset/model/gargoyle/face.mat
/asset/model/rock.model
/asset/model/sword.model


In such a setup, your gargoyle.mod might have 4 sub meshes using 3 materials, something like:

body =&gt; /asset/material/stone.mat
sword =&gt; /asset/material/steel.mat
armor =&gt; /asset/material/steel.mat
head =&gt; /asset/model/gargoyle/face.mat


This maps to a structure like:

materials: [0:stone, 1:steel, 2:face]
meshes: [0:(body, 0), 1:(sword, 1), 2:(armor, 1), 3:(head, 2)]


Your engine basically loads that data, loading any materials referenced that's it's missing.  Assuming you've already loaded a number of materials, the in-memory format would be similar to the above but with different IDs (mapping to in-memory structures and not the on-file structure):

materials: [..., 25:stone, ..., 57:steel, ..., 93:face, ...]
models: [..., gargoyle: [0:(body, 25), 1:(sword, 57), 2:(armor, 57), 3:(face, 93)], ...]

5423,5423,8610,Where to find ferry flights and empty leg flights?,"Based on this question Avoiding crew fatigue on empty leg flights I learned that there are ""empty leg"" flights or ""ferry flights"".

These seem a good option but I would like to know more about them.

Where are these announced? How can one travel this way?
",nsn,https://travel.stackexchange.com/users/3736,"Corporate/Business Aircraft

For corporate aircraft, this is a common occurrence and there have indeed been attempts to utilise these legs. A quick search on Google for empty legs turns up plenty of results. I came across two companies called flyvictor and returnjet that offered a bunch of flights from all spots in Europe.

Another similar possibility is getting a ticket for an extra seat on corporate jets that are not 'ferry flights' but simply have extra capacity. This article (""How to fly on a private jet for under $200 per person"") might interest you.

Note:


They are 'opportunist' in nature. There is no guarantee a flight will turn up for your desired route, and/or there will be a return flight.
The company will always try and sell a flight like a normal charter if possible.




Commercial Aircraft

For commercial airlines, ferry flights are avoided as far as possible. They are (in principle) nothing but money down the drain. You will encounter ferry flights:


When you need to move the aircraft for maintence. 


British Airways run a facility in Cardiff for maintaining among others their huge fleet of Boeing 747s.
Austrian Airlines run a facility in Bratislava, requiring a 20-minute hop for aircraft due for maintence from Vienna. 

When stuff messes up, most notably breakdowns. For instance, an mechanical breakdown at a remote airport followed by ferrying the aircraft back once repaired.


The issue is that:


These flights are often at strange and/or irregular times.
Occasionally crewed by only cockpit crew and no flight attendants.


As such, there is little incentive for airlines to let passengers along even (if it may legally possible). The cost, time, paperwork and extra staff would most probably not pay off for the low number of passengers that could be expected.

4225,4225,6739,How to describe the differences in skewed data with same median but statistically different distribution?,"I am comparing length of stay after laparoscopic and open appendectomy in over 160000 patients. LOS is typically a skewed variable so I use the median and interquartile range and ranksum test to describe the result, which is 2, IQR 2-3 and 2, IQR 2-4, p&lt;0.0001. So there is a highly significant difference but it does not show that well in the median and IQR. 

The difference in length of stay is very small. This finding is a negative finding but still interesting as it goes against what most people think about LOS after laparoscopic appendectomy. That is why I want to report on the difference in LOS which is not evident if I only report median and IQR with p-value.

The arithmetic mean (3.1 vs 2.8 and a difference of 0.3 days) is not recommended as the distribution is skewed. I wonder if any other measure could be used like, geometric mean (2.5 vs 2.3, difference 0.2 days) or harmonic mean (2.1 vs 1.9 days, difference 0.2 days)?  When can I use geometric mean or harmonic mean? 

I am inclined to use the harmonic mean which comes closest to the median and gives a difference of 0.2 days. Is this incorrect?
",Roland,https://stats.stackexchange.com/users/21094,"If you want to describe the difference in distribution, perhaps something like a Q-Q plot, or a pair of kernel densities would be common tools, though I assume you have quite discrete looking distributions, in which case that may make something like a pair of barcharts/histograms or a pair of ECDFs better (if possible on a single display)

If you do go with looking at the difference in ECDF, the two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic would be the ideal ""measure"" of significance to go with that, since it's based on the biggest (vertical) difference in ECDF.

If you compare barplots(/histograms) for a discrete distribution, you might like to look at the kinds of measures of discrepancy indicated by smooth tests of goodness of fit (Neyman-Barton type tests), but where the statistic is adapted to two samples. This would in effect correspond to partitioning a chi-square into components associated with orthogonal polynomials, the first of which would correspond to location (a linear term), the second to variance (a quadratic term), and so on (typically you'd look out to order 4 or 6).

1877,1877,2980,Looking for story where weather control makes snow fall once in warm climate,"I am looking for a very good story I read many years ago. The story was about a request to a politician that an old dying man would like to see snow fall before he died. The world now had weather control (maybe by controlling sunspots?) but he was in a warm climate (southern California?) and could not be moved and was near death. The man had been instrumental in the early days of weather control. I think the story starts by following the politician who decided to try to honor the man's request and passes a special bill thru the world legislature to make it happen. It then moves to a women (I think) in the weather service who needs to do something radical (in boats on the sun?) to make it happen. I think there were 3 vignettes but I'm forgetting one of them.

  Why avoid increment (&ldquo;++&rdquo;) and decrement (&ldquo;--&rdquo;) operators in JavaScript?  




I'm a big fan of Douglas Crockford and his excellent book, JavaScript: The Good Parts. I also use his JSLint tool on an hourly basis before checking in any code to our repository, as is good sense.

One thing I've noticed when running code through JSLint is its insistence that the ++ increment operator is somehow evil. I know I can turn certain rules off, but that's cheating ;). Crockford mentions his dislike on page 112 of JS: TGP...


  In my own practice, I observed that when I used ++ and --, my code tended to be too tight, too tricky, too cryptic. So, as a matter of discipline, I don't use them any more. I think that as a result, my coding style has become cleaner.


That's all very lovely, but he doesn't give any examples of the way he codes them now. I assume he's doing something like...

var i;
i = 0;
i = i + 1;


Again, great, but I've got a few basic 'for loops' in my JS code, as I imagine many people have, and I've always used the standard syntax...

for (i = 0; i &lt; myArray.length; i++) {

I know what these relations are all about, but what I have trouble with is how to find them. For example, I see no reflexive relation in the set. Does ""including R"" mean that i can extend R with any element from the given set? So for example, if I am looking for a reflexion can I just add (a, a)?

If I can extend the set, my solution would be:

Symmetric: Add (b,a)
Transitive: Already satisfied
Antisymmetric: Already satisfied? I am not sure about this one

First you need to add $(x,x)$ for every $x\in S=\{a,b,c,d,e\}$ which will give you $R_r=R\cup\{(a,a),(b,b),(c,c), (d,d), (e,e)\}$--the smallest reflexive relation containing $R$.

For a symmetric one, you need to add all of the elements of $R$ where you switch $x$ and $y$, i.e. $R_s=R\cup\{(b,a), (c,a), (c,b)\}$

Continuing for the others, we need a transitive one, so we need to see if there are $xRy$ and $yRz$, and in-fact there is exactly one, namely since $aRb$ and $bRc$ we need to add $aRc$, but you already have $(a,c)\in R$, so $R_t=R$.

Finally anti-symmetry is already satisfied, since there are no $x,y\in S$ such that $xRy$ and $yRx$, so $R=R_a$ is already anti-symmetric. If you have trouble seeing how this is, remember that antisymmetric is parsed in logical symbols as

$$\forall x,y\in S (xRy\land yRx\implies x=y)$$

Since the set of $x,y\in S$ such that $xRy$ and $yRx$ is empty, the condition is vacuously true because all $\forall z\in\varnothing$ statements are vacuously true because the negation is $\exists z'\in\varnothing$ which is clearly false, since there are no elements in an empty set.

A minimal example, using siunitx:

\documentclass{standalone}
\usepackage[mathlf]{MinionPro}
\usepackage{siunitx}
\sisetup{mode=text}
\begin{document}
{\figureversion{tab}
  \begin{tabular}{SSS[table-format=4.1]}
    {A wide heading} &amp; $x$ &amp; {more data} \\

    1.674 &amp; 1.671 &amp; 4882.8 \\
  \end{tabular}}
\end{document}

In your original code, you have to worry about normalizing the time structure after changing the hour offset.  You can do that with the mktime() function.  Here's a program based on the function in the question, which is pure C and avoids the problems of returning a pointer to a local variable (and the #define ending with a semi-colon):

#include &lt;assert.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;time.h&gt;

#define PST (-8)

extern int getSecondSystemTime(char *buffer, size_t buflen);

int getSecondSystemTime(char *buffer, size_t buflen)
{
    time_t rawtime = time(0);;
    struct tm *timeinfo;
    char t_buff[32];

    timeinfo = gmtime(&amp;rawtime);
    timeinfo-&gt;tm_hour = timeinfo-&gt;tm_hour + PST;

    time_t pst_time = mktime(timeinfo);
    assert(pst_time != (time_t)-1);
    int len = strftime(t_buff, sizeof(t_buff), ""%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"", timeinfo);
    assert(len != 0);

    int rv = snprintf(buffer, buflen, ""%ld = %s (%s)"", (long)rawtime, t_buff, 
                      ""Pacific Time (US &amp; Canada)"");
    assert(rv &gt; 0);
    return rv;
}

int main(void)
{
    char buffer[128];

    getSecondSystemTime(buffer, sizeof(buffer));
    printf(""%s\n"", buffer);
    return(0);
}


Clearly, a better interface would pass the UTC time value and the time zone offset (in hours and minutes) as arguments.  Despite the fact that my computer runs in US/Pacific (or America/Los_Angeles) time zone by default, I tested with TZ set to various values (including US/Eastern, IST-05:30) and got the correct values out; I'm reasonably convinced based on past experience that the calculation is correct.

I have another program that attempts to dissect whether the -1 returned from mktime() is because of an error or because the converted time corresponds to (time_t)-1:

/* Attempt to determine whether time is really 1969-12-31 23:59:59 +00:00 */
static int unix_epoch_minus_one(const struct tm *lt)
{
    printf(""tm_sec = %d\n"", lt-&gt;tm_sec);

1965,1965,3129,Looking for story where weather control makes snow fall once in warm climate,"I am looking for a very good story I read many years ago. The story was about a request to a politician that an old dying man would like to see snow fall before he died. The world now had weather control (maybe by controlling sunspots?) but he was in a warm climate (southern California?) and could not be moved and was near death. The man had been instrumental in the early days of weather control. I think the story starts by following the politician who decided to try to honor the man's request and passes a special bill thru the world legislature to make it happen. It then moves to a women (I think) in the weather service who needs to do something radical (in boats on the sun?) to make it happen. I think there were 3 vignettes but I'm forgetting one of them. The story ends with snow falling on 1 acre and the man gets to see the snow before he dies (which may occur at the end of the snowfall). Does anyone else recall this story and could provide title and author?

Just like in atomic physics, the symmetry or antisymmetry of the orbital part of the wave function is correlated with the wave function for the spins, and therefore with the total spin, in various ways to guarantee that the overall wave function is antisymmetric. Some of these solutions have $j=1/2$, others have $j=3/2$. There are no other values of spins one may get by combining three $j=1/2$ spins.

Is that possible?
",rugbert,https://wordpress.stackexchange.com/users/19536,"This not a complete and ready-made answer, but the below should get you started.

First thing to note is, deleting and modifying are different functionalities, so different functions and hooks are relevant to it. Namely we are talking about wp_delete_term() - source and wp_update_term() - source - regarding the functions.

So lets take a look at wp_delete_term(), you have to at least consider two hooks: edit_term_taxonomies and delete_term_taxonomy. They are both relevant because of the bulk action and because of the handling of hierarchical taxonomies.

Below some exemplary code how to approach this. I've tried to explain the most important things inside the code. The rest you have to read up on yourself.

First the edit_term_taxonomies hook:

add_action(
    'edit_term_taxonomies',
    'wpse160191_top_level_lock_down_edit_term_taxonomies',
    10,
    1
);
function wpse160191_top_level_lock_down_edit_term_taxonomies(
    $edit_tt_ids
) {
    $screen_obj = get_current_screen();
    $base = $screen_obj-&gt;base;
    $taxonomy = $screen_obj-&gt;taxonomy;

    if(
        // these are the conditions we are checking against
        // is this a tag edit page
        $base == 'edit-tags'
        // we want this only for a specific taxonomy
        &amp;&amp; $taxonomy == 'category'
        // not super and/or admin
        &amp;&amp; ! current_user_can( 'manage_options' )
        // a least an editor
        &amp;&amp; current_user_can( 'manage_categories' )
    ) {

        // these are the terms up for deletion
        $terms_queue_for_deletion = $_POST['delete_tags'];
        $term_parents_ids = array();
        // we need information if or not one of the terms is a top level one
        foreach ( $terms_queue_for_deletion as $term_id ) {
            $term_obj = get_term_by( 'id', $term_id, 'category' );
            $term_parent = $term_obj-&gt;parent;
            $term_parents_ids[] = $term_parent;
        }

        if( empty( $edit_tt_ids ) ) {
            return;
        }

        if( ! empty( $edit_tt_ids ) ) {
            if ( in_array( 0, $term_parents_ids ) ) {
                $msg = new WP_Error(
                'parent_terms_are_forever',
                __('Sorry, you are not allowed to delete top level terms.')
                );
                wp_die( $msg );
            } else {
                return;
            }
        }
    }
}


Second the delete_term_taxonomy hook:

add_action(
    'delete_term_taxonomy',
    'wpse160191_top_level_lock_down_delete_term_taxonomy',
    10,
    1
);
function wpse160191_top_level_lock_down_delete_term_taxonomy(
    $tt_id
) {

    $screen_obj = get_current_screen();
    $base = $screen_obj-&gt;base;
    $taxonomy = $screen_obj-&gt;taxonomy;

    if (
        // these are the conditions we are checking against
        // is this a tag edit page
        $base == 'edit-tags'
        // we want this only for a specific taxonomy
        &amp;&amp; $taxonomy == 'category'
        // not super and/or admin
        &amp;&amp; ! current_user_can( 'manage_options' )
        // a least an editor
        &amp;&amp; current_user_can( 'manage_categories' )
    ) {
        $term_obj = get_term_by( 'term_taxonomy_id', $tt_id, 'category' );
        $parent_id = $term_obj-&gt;parent;
        if (
            // this applies only to top level terms
            $parent_id == 0
        ) {
            $msg = new WP_Error(
                'parent_terms_are_forever',
                __('s:Sorry, you are not allowed to delete top level terms.')
            );
            wp_die( $msg );
        }
    }
}


As mentioned above, it gets a bit more complicated, mainly because of the AJAX actions. If you are thinking about doing this with the well known and simple check:

if ( defined('DOING_AJAX') &amp;&amp; DOING_AJAX ) {
    // code
}


I can tell you right now, that I'm pretty certain it won't be sufficient enough. Mostly because you won't be able to do all the checks you need. If you are fine with just disabling or, to be exact, removing the link to the AJAX action, you can do it somewhat like this:

add_action(
    'admin_head' ,
    'wpse160191_remove_ajax_delete_link'
);
function wpse160191_remove_ajax_delete_link() {
    $screen_obj = get_current_screen();
    $base = $screen_obj-&gt;base;
    $taxonomy = $screen_obj-&gt;taxonomy;

    if(
        // lets just remove the link on that one page and not everywhere
        $base == 'edit-tags'
        &amp;&amp; $taxonomy == 'category'
    ) {
    ?&gt;
        &lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;
            jQuery(document).ready(function($) {
                var element = 'span.delete';
                $(element).each(function(){
                    $(element).css('opacity', '0');
                    $(element).css('pointer-events', 'none');
                    $(element).remove();
                });
            });
        &lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;?php
    }
}


Of course you shouldn't do it inline and so on, but you can optimize yourself. This of course is not very satisfying, because we just removed the functionality.

One way I imagine to deal with the AJAX action would be to make use of debug_backtrace(). This would offer a way to determine and handle the AJAX action correctly. It could be implemented into the above shown code. A caveat of course is that debug_backtrace() is performance-wise expensive and in a larger scale surely not recommendable.
Another way would be to implement your own AJAX action as replacement for wp_ajax_delete_tag(), but to do so you have to additionally either have to extend the WP_Terms_List_Table or use some hooks in there to achieve this. Not exactly sure at the moment, so you have to inspect that further yourself.

The procedure for wp_update_term() and disallowing updating/modifying is analogous to the above shown. With the same considerations concerning the AJAX part, especially because of the inline quick edit possibility. 



At first I totally misread the question and gave this as an answer.
Keeping it because it might be useful to others.

What you can do is hooking into the pre_insert_term to do the checks needed.

Code:

add_action( 'pre_insert_term', 'wpse160191_restrict_top_level_term_creation', 10, 2 );
function wpse160191_restrict_top_level_term_creation( $term, $taxonomy ) {
    if( 
        // these are the conditions we are checking against
        // we want this only for a specific taxonomy
        $taxonomy == 'topics'
        // a value of 0 or -1 does indicate the top level
        &amp;&amp; $_POST[ 'parent' ] &lt;= '0'
        // not super and/or admin
        &amp;&amp; ! current_user_can( 'manage_options' )
        // a least an editor
        &amp;&amp; current_user_can( 'manage_categories' )
    ) {
        // the user is an editor and not allowed to add parent terms
        // so return a friendly message so the user at least knows 
        return new WP_Error(
            'parent_terms_not_allowed_for_editors',
            __('Sorry, you are not allowed to add parent terms.')
        );
    } else {
        // a super and/or admin, s|he is allowed to do what s|he wants
        return $term;
    }
}


The pre_insert_term hook is part of the wp_insert_term() function.


Some Notes:


The parent value of the $args is 0, when no parent is selected. But we have no access to those inside the action, the form does return the value of -1 for $_POST[ 'parent' ] if »None« is selected. So &lt;= '0' should work in any case.  
We are not passing the user role to the current_user_can() function, because that is just wrong - although you see it a lot, it still is bad. Instead capabilities are used to determine, which kind of user we are dealing with.

Well guys, I think I've finally figured it out. It seems to have been a temp issue. I took some action to reduce temps, and attached two big solid copper blocks with thermal paste to the label side of the hdd. Temps now are going from 50c-60c variably. I'm probably going to make use of my eSata port on this thing, and relocate the internal drive to an external enclosure and eventually put in an SSD in the near future. :) My guess was the drive was going into a low power mode to reduce temps. That's the only thing I can think of.
",DemonCamber,https://superuser.com/users/369153,"How have you used this drive? If it is quite new, the solution might be as simple as formatting (not quick-formatting) the drive.
I remember a time when HDDs came unformatted and your PC had to do a format on the blocks it was going to write to, before it could actually write the files. (If the drive had been formatted completely, the performance would be as expected and consistent)
But I am not sure whether this scenario still applies today.

My suggestion:
Create a partition on the drive (choose a size as large as possible but do not format the newly created partition) and run the test again.
Then format said partition and try again.

Could someone please take a look at the SMART data and tell me if anything looks off to you?


Well guys, I think I've finally figured it out. It seems to have been a temp issue. I took some action to reduce temps, and attached two big solid copper blocks with thermal paste to the label side of the hdd. Temps now are going from 50c-60c variably. I'm probably going to make use of my eSata port on this thing, and relocate the internal drive to an external enclosure and eventually put in an SSD in the near future. :) My guess was the drive was going into a low power mode to reduce temps. That's the only thing I can think of.
","How have you used this drive? If it is quite new, the solution might be as simple as formatting (not quick-formatting) the drive.
I remember a time when HDDs came unformatted and your PC had to do a format on the blocks it was going to write to, before it could actually write the files. (If the drive had been formatted completely, the performance would be as expected and consistent)
But I am not sure whether this scenario still applies today.

My suggestion:
Create a partition on the drive (choose a size as large as possible but do not format the newly created partition) and run the test again.
Then format said partition and try again.

Therefore, wouldn't a mental interface with a computer be more efficient?  Surely, then, they could have the drones in their stations for most of the time, just thinking to interact with the computer rather than having to tap their way through an interface.  Is there any reason given for this?

And, although I only recall seeing 7 of 9 using the computer via physical interaction in Scorpion, there are plenty of instances in other episodes where other drones also use physical interaction with the computer.

...but ended up being one of the most complex, complicated, and tangled aspects of the game.

I'll try to untangle the mess here in this answer, but the simple answer is that a melee basic attack and a ranged basic attack are attacks every CREATURE can use. In other words, every player character, every NPC, and every monster can all make basic attacks, adding a certain layer of common attack across the entire game.

WARNING: What follows is largely based on analysis, synthesis, and assumption.



D&amp;D 4e launched with the expectation of only one Melee Basic Attack.

The original Player's Handbook defined a Melee Basic Attack as an attack power everyone possesses, regardless of class, and is, for everyone, a strength-based attack. Likewise, the original Player's Handbook expected Strength to govern all melee basic attacks always: all classes were expected to use strength to make melee basic attacks, including classes that used other stats for other melee attack powers.

This led to, for example, Rangers being split into dexterity-based archers and strength-based dual-wielders, Clerics being split into wisdom-based spellcasters and strength-based militants, Paladins being split into charisma-based divine defenders and strength-based swordsmen, and strength-based ruffianism being promoted amongst otherwise dexterity-based rogues.

In other words, there was originally a design idea that, no matter what you did in terms of your class, when it came to just plain hitting someone with a weapon, you did it with your strength.

The other main reason for the Melee Basic Attack was that the designers of D&amp;D knew they were constructing an additive system: more and more at-will powers would be added with potentially unexpected functions; by introducing the Melee Basic Attack the designers thought they would have a constant and reliable tool around which to base certain mechanics.



D&amp;D 4e set an early precedent for Melee Basic Attacks being important.

PHB1 had four particularly important uses for the Melee Basic Attack:


The expectation was that players would primarily use the Melee Basic Attack after using the charge action, making it important to players that needed to cover large distances or otherwise wanted the +1 bonus to attack.
The expectation was that players would primarily use the Melee Basic Attack as an Opportunity Attack. The premise was that provoking an opportunity attack would result in some damage but otherwise avoid applying the potentially crippling effects that would accompany the complex profusion of at-will powers. However, this had the consequence of rendering opportunity attacks made by characters that did not invest in strength meaningless, as they were unlikely to hit and, even if they did, not deal much damage. The rogue might be particularly deadly in melee, flanking with its dagger, but without strength monsters could just walk away without fear of the OA reprisal.
The Warlord introduced the concept of ""lazy"" play, or a character that grants other characters basic attacks. Originally, this meant a simple strength vs AC attack and powerful through its versatility rather than through the power being invoked. For example, granting a Melee Basic Attack to a Fighter would let that Fighter mark an additional target per round; granting the attack to a Rogue, Ranger, or Warlock that had missed on their turn would let them invoke their Striker damage feature (Sneak Attack, Quarry, or Curse respectively; note these were all originally once-per-round effects).
The Fighter's mark reprisal feature, Combat Challenge, granted a Melee Basic Attack, in comparison to the other PHB1 defender, the Paladin, who's Divine Challenge dealt its own damage. A Fighter's ability to defend therefore relies on having a good Melee Basic Attack.




D&amp;D 4e set an early precedent for alternate RANGED Basic Attacks.

Although there was only one Melee Basic Attack (strength vs AC), there were four Ranged Basic Attacks. The two weapon-based Ranged Basic Attacks were based on dexterity for light thrown and ranged weapons, and strength for heavy thrown weapons. Furthermore, Warlocks (Eldritch Blast) and Wizards (Magic Missile) had two at-will powers that specifically stated that they could be used as Ranged Basic Attacks.

On the other hand, there were no primary uses for Ranged Basic Attacks in PHB1: the Warlord could only grant Melee Basic Attacks at-will, and you couldn't use Ranged Basic Attacks on charges or Opportunity Attacks or Combat Challenge. This left PHB1 with an odd dichotomy of design, but also set the precedent for what would follow...



PHB2 introduced the way of swapping out Strength on the Melee Basic Attack.

PHB2 introduced the Melee Training feats, which allowed a player to change the attribute they used for attacking and damage with their Melee Basic Attack. This could be capitalized upon by a whole host of classes who had at-will melee attack powers but otherwise did not use strength, such as the newly introduced Avenger and Bard. This also made sense for the PHB1 Rogue and, to a lesser extent, the Paladin.

This was largely introduced to provide viable opportunity attack and charge attacks to these classes, especially Rogues and Avengers. Why would a rogue use dexterity to stab with its dagger on 99% of its attacks, but not when making a basic attack? Same with an Avenger using wisdom? The Melee Training feat was a patchwork solution to the odd logic of the original rules and seen by some as a math fix (not unlike Expertise, also introduced in PHB2) to be given for free to patch things up as needed.



PHB2 introduced the Druid, which needed its own unique Melee Basic Attack.

The Melee Basic Attack, as originally written, is a weapon attack; it was assumed that all characters under all circumstances would be able to make weapon (or unarmed) attacks. That all changed with the introduction of the shape-shifting Druid class in Player's Handbook 2.

The Druid's Wild Shape power limits the Druid to only using powers with the Beast Form keyword: this rules out Melee Basic Attack. Such transformed Druids would lose all opportunity attack or charge abilities, so the authors helpfully supplied Druids with two at-will powers that could be used as Melee Basic Attacks (Savage Rend and Grasping Claws). Note that the third PHB3 Beast Form at-will, Pounce, could be used as a Melee Basic Attack but only on a charge.

The rules for building a Druid requires the player to pick at least one at-will power with the Beast Form keyword. Thus, while it was still possible for a Druid to have only Pounce and not be able to make opportunity attacks while in beast form, the Druid would at least always be able to charge.

Of particular note is that both of these powers also added additional functionality to put them in line with ""normal"" at-will powers: Savage Rend also slides the target 1 square and Grasping Claws also slows the target. This was an unusual decision: why didn't the designers simply add a ""Beast Form Melee Basic Attack"" that mirrored the typical Melee Basic Attack and grant it to Druids? Then they could have avoided adding special rules to the other beast form attacks...

In any case, these powers were not terribly problematic because although they replaced the Melee Basic Attack, they also required the Beast Form keyword, preventing their use by weapon-wielding characters (but just wait...).



The Power books introduced more new Melee Basic Attacks.

For example, Arcane Power introduced a melee alternative for the Warlock's Eldritch Blast, Eldritch Strike. Presumably because Eldritch Blast was a Ranged Basic Attack, Eldritch Strike was made a Melee Basic Attack.

However, in addition to being a charisma-based or constitution-based rather than strength-based, Eldritch Strike also had the feature of sliding the target by 1 square on a hit. This was now a weapon-based attack that added considerable functionality to opportunity attacks and charges that didn't exist before.

Most frighteningly, if a Fighter used this power when their Combat Challenge was invoked, they could use an Immediate Interrupt to slide the attacker away from their target, negating the attack entirely as well as dealing damage; this was not only well beyond the original scope of the feature, it was also totally awesome and immediately focused upon by character optimizers.



As more material was published, Melee Basic Attacks became increasingly exploitable.

I won't go into the whole analysis of every issue, but as more and more things were added, and because of the nature of D&amp;D that all things can be creatively combined by a sufficiently creative player with a large enough toolbox of options, Melee Basic Attacks took on a whole life of their own.

As a random example, Dragon Magazine introduced three Were- themes: Werewolf, Werebear, and Wererat. All three had a beast form transformation not unlike the Druid's Wild Shape; in fact, all three used the exact same Beast Form keywords. Most interestingly, at level 10 characters with the Were- themes can transform into a half-humanoid half-beast hybrid, and can now use all powers with and without the Beast Form keyword. This meant that a character could ""poach"" the Druid's Savage Rend and use it by half-shifting.

There are numerous other odd results of these features mixing together to create incredibly powerful Melee Basic Attacks that could be used on charges, on opportunity attacks, for the Fighter's combat challenge, and so forth.



Essentials made Basic Attacks Basic again...

Partway through D&amp;D 4th Edition's lifespan, Wizards decided the game was too complex to attract new players and released a revised set of character options under the Essentials line: Heroes of the blah-blah.

Essentials tried to simplify all the rules by making the Basic Attack an explicit and central part of the character. Characters would explicitly have their Basic Attack and powers would modify that attack rather than give them new attacks.

For example, the Essentials Sorcerer has Elemental Bolt, a Ranged Basic Attack, and their Encounter power is Elemental Escalation, which makes Elemental Bolt hit an extra target and do extra damage.

This meant for much simpler play: the Sorcerer player simply uses the same power all the time: whenever they shoot, whenever they're granted basic attacks, whenever they augment with their Encounter power, and so forth.

At the same time, Essentials also vastly simplified rules surrounding Basic Attacks. They were now modified primarily through Stances, which became very common (many Essentials classes have two or more stances that modify their Basic Attack). The notion of granted attacks was done away with, as was power poaching: Half-Elf lost Dilettante, all multiclass feats were removed, and there were no rules for hybrid characters.

So, on the one hand, defenders now made MBAs as Opportunity Actions (rather than Immediate actions) and had a marking aura around them; on the other hand, they could never change their core class MBA so the designers always knew exactly what mark enforcement was being dished out. This led to a different, but internally balanced, style of play.



...but Essentials didn't mix well with the rest of D&amp;D 4e

The problem with Essentials is that, while one part of Wizards of the Coast was trying to change fundamental design concepts to create a simpler style of game, another part of Wizards of the Coast was waving the ""it's not a new game, it'll all work together"" flag. This led to a number of diverging ways of delivering D&amp;D to players: the official Online Character Builder lets you build pure Essentials characters, but Dragon magazine also published articles for making hybrid and multiclass Essentials characters to mix them with non-essentials characters.

This opened a huge can of exploitable worms because Essentials and ""Vanilla"" were built on very different fundamental concepts. In Essentials, the core idea of what a Basic Attack was intended to be changed. Rather than a very simple and common and function-free source of damage to be triggered on a number of specific circumstances, it became the primary tool around which the entire class was built.

This leads to a number of well-known exploits, such as taking an Essentials Pyro Sorcerer and buffing the fire-based Ranged Basic Attack with items such as Eagle Eye Goggles, which adds +1 to ranged basic attacks. Obviously, when the Goggles were made, it never occurred that a Ranged Basic Attack would actually be the most powerful power (or the only power) a class would have. It was never meat to be an item that plainly boosted the accuracy of an entire class's repertoire of (one) power.

Or, for example, poaching a powerful MBA and an Essentials Defender Aura.



Current state of Basic Attacks.

It's hard to really pin down the current state of Basic Attacks beyond ""it's a whole load of messiness most DMs don't want to have to deal with."" The state of character optimization definitely needs to be something the party discusses and agrees upon together, and modifications to Basic Attacks should be part of that discussion.

One thing that should be kept in mind is establishing a level playing field with all the players at the table. If some members of the party build convoluted characters to exploit Melee Basic Attacks and the others don't, combat can become a complex mess of monsters merrily trotting past worthless unoptimized opportunity attacks to become completely crippled by a well-executed (and optimized) basic attack.

My personal suggestion is to snuff out as much basic attack optimization as possible unless the entire group is prepared to handle them, and instead blanket convert the standard Melee Basic Attack rules to apply the same to all characters: if the character can make a melee attack at-will, then they use those values for to-hit and damage but apply no other effects on hit. For example, if there's a Rogue with Deft Strike, let them use the same to-hit and damage values as Deft Strike on a Melee Basic Attack (ie: dexterity) but without the 2 squares of movement.

This allows for simple and standardized opportunity attacks and charge attacks across all players, and lets everyone feel like they can stop monsters from just waltzing by willy-nilly.

As far as what you do in your campaign, that's up to you, but hopefully I've provided enough background here to make the right sort of choices that best fits your group :)

For example, granting a Melee Basic Attack to a Fighter would let that Fighter mark an additional target per round; granting the attack to a Rogue, Ranger, or Warlock that had missed on their turn would let them invoke their Striker damage feature (Sneak Attack, Quarry, or Curse respectively; note these were all originally once-per-round effects).
The Fighter's mark reprisal feature, Combat Challenge, granted a Melee Basic Attack, in comparison to the other PHB1 defender, the Paladin, who's Divine Challenge dealt its own damage. A Fighter's ability to defend therefore relies on having a good Melee Basic Attack.




D&amp;D 4e set an early precedent for alternate RANGED Basic Attacks.

Although there was only one Melee Basic Attack (strength vs AC), there were four Ranged Basic Attacks. The two weapon-based Ranged Basic Attacks were based on dexterity for light thrown and ranged weapons, and strength for heavy thrown weapons. Furthermore, Warlocks (Eldritch Blast) and Wizards (Magic Missile) had two at-will powers that specifically stated that they could be used as Ranged Basic Attacks.

On the other hand, there were no primary uses for Ranged Basic Attacks in PHB1: the Warlord could only grant Melee Basic Attacks at-will, and you couldn't use Ranged Basic Attacks on charges or Opportunity Attacks or Combat Challenge. This left PHB1 with an odd dichotomy of design, but also set the precedent for what would follow...



PHB2 introduced the way of swapping out Strength on the Melee Basic Attack.

PHB2 introduced the Melee Training feats, which allowed a player to change the attribute they used for attacking and damage with their Melee Basic Attack. This could be capitalized upon by a whole host of classes who had at-will melee attack powers but otherwise did not use strength, such as the newly introduced Avenger and Bard. This also made sense for the PHB1 Rogue and, to a lesser extent, the Paladin.

This was largely introduced to provide viable opportunity attack and charge attacks to these classes, especially Rogues and Avengers. Why would a rogue use dexterity to stab with its dagger on 99% of its attacks, but not when making a basic attack? Same with an Avenger using wisdom? The Melee Training feat was a patchwork solution to the odd logic of the original rules and seen by some as a math fix (not unlike Expertise, also introduced in PHB2) to be given for free to patch things up as needed.



PHB2 introduced the Druid, which needed its own unique Melee Basic Attack.

The Melee Basic Attack, as originally written, is a weapon attack; it was assumed that all characters under all circumstances would be able to make weapon (or unarmed) attacks. That all changed with the introduction of the shape-shifting Druid class in Player's Handbook 2.

The Druid's Wild Shape power limits the Druid to only using powers with the Beast Form keyword: this rules out Melee Basic Attack. Such transformed Druids would lose all opportunity attack or charge abilities, so the authors helpfully supplied Druids with two at-will powers that could be used as Melee Basic Attacks (Savage Rend and Grasping Claws). Note that the third PHB3 Beast Form at-will, Pounce, could be used as a Melee Basic Attack but only on a charge.

The rules for building a Druid requires the player to pick at least one at-will power with the Beast Form keyword. Thus, while it was still possible for a Druid to have only Pounce and not be able to make opportunity attacks while in beast form, the Druid would at least always be able to charge.

Of particular note is that both of these powers also added additional functionality to put them in line with ""normal"" at-will powers: Savage Rend also slides the target 1 square and Grasping Claws also slows the target. This was an unusual decision: why didn't the designers simply add a ""Beast Form Melee Basic Attack"" that mirrored the typical Melee Basic Attack and grant it to Druids? Then they could have avoided adding special rules to the other beast form attacks...

In any case, these powers were not terribly problematic because although they replaced the Melee Basic Attack, they also required the Beast Form keyword, preventing their use by weapon-wielding characters (but just wait...).



The Power books introduced more new Melee Basic Attacks.

For example, Arcane Power introduced a melee alternative for the Warlock's Eldritch Blast, Eldritch Strike. Presumably because Eldritch Blast was a Ranged Basic Attack, Eldritch Strike was made a Melee Basic Attack.

However, in addition to being a charisma-based or constitution-based rather than strength-based, Eldritch Strike also had the feature of sliding the target by 1 square on a hit. This was now a weapon-based attack that added considerable functionality to opportunity attacks and charges that didn't exist before.

Most frighteningly, if a Fighter used this power when their Combat Challenge was invoked, they could use an Immediate Interrupt to slide the attacker away from their target, negating the attack entirely as well as dealing damage; this was not only well beyond the original scope of the feature, it was also totally awesome and immediately focused upon by character optimizers.



As more material was published, Melee Basic Attacks became increasingly exploitable.

I won't go into the whole analysis of every issue, but as more and more things were added, and because of the nature of D&amp;D that all things can be creatively combined by a sufficiently creative player with a large enough toolbox of options, Melee Basic Attacks took on a whole life of their own.

As a random example, Dragon Magazine introduced three Were- themes: Werewolf, Werebear, and Wererat. All three had a beast form transformation not unlike the Druid's Wild Shape; in fact, all three used the exact same Beast Form keywords. Most interestingly, at level 10 characters with the Were- themes can transform into a half-humanoid half-beast hybrid, and can now use all powers with and without the Beast Form keyword. This meant that a character could ""poach"" the Druid's Savage Rend and use it by half-shifting.

There are numerous other odd results of these features mixing together to create incredibly powerful Melee Basic Attacks that could be used on charges, on opportunity attacks, for the Fighter's combat challenge, and so forth.



Essentials made Basic Attacks Basic again...

Partway through D&amp;D 4th Edition's lifespan, Wizards decided the game was too complex to attract new players and released a revised set of character options under the Essentials line: Heroes of the blah-blah.

Essentials tried to simplify all the rules by making the Basic Attack an explicit and central part of the character. Characters would explicitly have their Basic Attack and powers would modify that attack rather than give them new attacks.

For example, the Essentials Sorcerer has Elemental Bolt, a Ranged Basic Attack, and their Encounter power is Elemental Escalation, which makes Elemental Bolt hit an extra target and do extra damage.

This meant for much simpler play: the Sorcerer player simply uses the same power all the time: whenever they shoot, whenever they're granted basic attacks, whenever they augment with their Encounter power, and so forth.

At the same time, Essentials also vastly simplified rules surrounding Basic Attacks. They were now modified primarily through Stances, which became very common (many Essentials classes have two or more stances that modify their Basic Attack). The notion of granted attacks was done away with, as was power poaching: Half-Elf lost Dilettante, all multiclass feats were removed, and there were no rules for hybrid characters.

So, on the one hand, defenders now made MBAs as Opportunity Actions (rather than Immediate actions) and had a marking aura around them; on the other hand, they could never change their core class MBA so the designers always knew exactly what mark enforcement was being dished out. This led to a different, but internally balanced, style of play.



...but Essentials didn't mix well with the rest of D&amp;D 4e

The problem with Essentials is that, while one part of Wizards of the Coast was trying to change fundamental design concepts to create a simpler style of game, another part of Wizards of the Coast was waving the ""it's not a new game, it'll all work together"" flag. This led to a number of diverging ways of delivering D&amp;D to players: the official Online Character Builder lets you build pure Essentials characters, but Dragon magazine also published articles for making hybrid and multiclass Essentials characters to mix them with non-essentials characters.

This opened a huge can of exploitable worms because Essentials and ""Vanilla"" were built on very different fundamental concepts. In Essentials, the core idea of what a Basic Attack was intended to be changed. Rather than a very simple and common and function-free source of damage to be triggered on a number of specific circumstances, it became the primary tool around which the entire class was built.

This leads to a number of well-known exploits, such as taking an Essentials Pyro Sorcerer and buffing the fire-based Ranged Basic Attack with items such as Eagle Eye Goggles, which adds +1 to ranged basic attacks. Obviously, when the Goggles were made, it never occurred that a Ranged Basic Attack would actually be the most powerful power (or the only power) a class would have. It was never meat to be an item that plainly boosted the accuracy of an entire class's repertoire of (one) power.

Or, for example, poaching a powerful MBA and an Essentials Defender Aura.



Current state of Basic Attacks.

It's hard to really pin down the current state of Basic Attacks beyond ""it's a whole load of messiness most DMs don't want to have to deal with."" The state of character optimization definitely needs to be something the party discusses and agrees upon together, and modifications to Basic Attacks should be part of that discussion.

One thing that should be kept in mind is establishing a level playing field with all the players at the table. If some members of the party build convoluted characters to exploit Melee Basic Attacks and the others don't, combat can become a complex mess of monsters merrily trotting past worthless unoptimized opportunity attacks to become completely crippled by a well-executed (and optimized) basic attack.

My personal suggestion is to snuff out as much basic attack optimization as possible unless the entire group is prepared to handle them, and instead blanket convert the standard Melee Basic Attack rules to apply the same to all characters: if the character can make a melee attack at-will, then they use those values for to-hit and damage but apply no other effects on hit. For example, if there's a Rogue with Deft Strike, let them use the same to-hit and damage values as Deft Strike on a Melee Basic Attack (ie: dexterity) but without the 2 squares of movement.

This allows for simple and standardized opportunity attacks and charge attacks across all players, and lets everyone feel like they can stop monsters from just waltzing by willy-nilly.

As far as what you do in your campaign, that's up to you, but hopefully I've provided enough background here to make the right sort of choices that best fits your group :)

The spatial conformal boundary acts as a repulsive wall, thus turning anti de Sitter space into an eternally closed quantum system. Superpositions remain superpositions and can never decohere. A closed system eventually thermalizes and undergoes Poincare recurrences. Whatever the dual is to an interacting conformal field theory, is it really a theory of quantum gravity, or does it only look like one superficially?
",theorist,https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/6788,"Your question is not about AdS at all, it is about a closed quantum system with a finite number of degrees of freedom.

If you examine the space-time near a finite area quantum black hole, you will see an approximate AdS space. For this reason, my original answer included AdS spaces in the list of finite systems, although this is completely false for what people would call a normal classical AdS space. Thse spaces are unbounded and make open systems. The near horizon extremal black hole is presumably sitting in an infinite spacetime, so it is also an open quantum system. So it is best to reformulate the question for the domain you intended:

How can you have irreversible decoherence in a closed quantum system with a finite number of degrees of freedom?

The same question can be formulated to a certain extent in a closed classical system, where Poincare recurrences still occur. How can you reconcile poincare recurrence with irreversible information gain by an observer?

I think the many-worlds point of view is most useful for understanding this. If you have a closed quantum system that contains an observer, it is the observer's gain in information that determines which relative branch of the wavefunction becomes the real one for this observer, a branch selection from the decohered branches which occurs outside the theory. The branches are still effectively dechered so long as the arrow of time is still forward, because the wavefunction is spreading out into new regions of the enormous phase space. It is reasonable to think that the system will need to thermalize and destroy all the observers long before the recurrence makes the entropy decrease to the initial value.

This observer can only exist while there is an arrow of time, so there is no real paradox. You can have effective decoherence and measurements for the thermodynamic arrow-of-time stage. The same is true in classical closed system, the observer will have to dissociate and reform in order for the system to have a poincare recurrence.

But perhaps you meant this as a counterexample to the claim that irreversible decoherence can occur in pure closed-system quantum mechanics. In this case, I agree that it is obvious that the closed system cannot really decohere irreversibly, since it will eventually recohere to close to its initial state.

The MOSFET and the diode are going to be isolated from the heatsink. Should I connect the heatsink to the ground via two screws that are shown below?

Should I connect four mounting screws in the corners of the PCB to ground?

I tried to minimize the length of the critical traces but the heatsink didn't allow me too much. In addition to that, I kept the area of these critical traces that can act as an antenna to a minimum -only as big as to carry the currents. Also, I tried to keep output capacitors away from the heatsink as they are electrolytic and they should be away from the heatsink.

It would be great if you can draw the main current loops!





",abdullah kahraman,https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/5035,"Added:  Points raised are being addressed. Have left most in and tidied as example of things to consider and that have now been considered. Added PFET level shift comment at end.
  [This comment is for anyone following this - NOT as an edit trace]. 

You do seem to be trying and have a general grasp of what is needed but, no rudeness intended, the circuit shows several signs of very major lack of design. You need to think things through MUCH more carefully.Fine detail cannot be looked at until you get the basic circuit details correct. As shown it will not work AT ALL for several major reasons. 

Drive polarity wrong:    The IC is able to be configured as a buck converter but as shown the output drive is of the wrong polarity if you use a P Channel high side switch and of the wrong voltage swing if you use an N Channel high side switch - see below. If using a P Channel MOSFET (which would be normal here) the output drive needs an inverter in it. As shown it will not work.

Level translator needed in driver:       If you DO run the IC off a 12V supply (and Vdd max = 15V) then the inverting driver which you have not yet got also needs to level translate as the MOSFET is high side and gate drive needs to go to 30V or whatever for MOSFET turn off. While addressing that do also ensure that MOSFET Vgs max is not exceeded when driving.

FET is wrong type          The MOSFET is nice enough BUT is N Channel (as befits the incorrect topology that you are using). An N channel MOSFET COULD be used there but the gate would need to be driven above V+ rail and you would need a gate drive supply. The overwhelmingly usual thing to do would be to use a P Channel MOSFET as the switch

Output diode      The output diode is very nice but is ""overkill"". The high max voltage leads also to higher than necessary forward operating voltage. You can probably get a few % more efficiency end to end with a lower voltage Schottky.

At a glance without pouring over the details the IC looks competent and should be capable of good efficiency as a buck regulator. I'd expect 90-95% to be achievable once the circuit was correct. 



Driving high side PFET.

Vin max = 32 V (specified).
 Vdd Ic = 12V (user specified) or 15V abs max.

PFET will have a Vgs max. Above that you get magic smoke.
 As PFET source is connected to Vin+ the Vgs is measure relative to Vin+.
 PFET gate can be driven low BELOW Vin+ by Vgsmax - ideally a bit less.

FET's that are not logic FETS often have Vgsmax of 20 to 25V.
 Most FETs are totally ""enhanced"" (aka turned fully on) by the time they have Vgs = 12V - see curves for FET of choice.
 Let's set Vgs max actual   = -12V relative to Vin+.
 This means that when Vin+ = 32V, Vgs may range from about 32V (FET is off) to 32-12 = 20V (FET is hard on).

Working Frequency: 300 KHz

Controller IC: FP5138 from Feeling Technology

MOSFET: IXTP44N100T from IXYS

Schottky Diode: MBR20100CT from ON Semi

The MOSFET and the diode are going to be isolated from the heatsink. Should I connect the heatsink to the ground via two screws that are shown below?

Should I connect four mounting screws in the corners of the PCB to ground?

I tried to minimize the length of the critical traces but the heatsink didn't allow me too much. In addition to that, I kept the area of these critical traces that can act as an antenna to a minimum -only as big as to carry the currents. Also, I tried to keep output capacitors away from the heatsink as they are electrolytic and they should be away from the heatsink.

It would be great if you can draw the main current loops!





","Added:  Points raised are being addressed. Have left most in and tidied as example of things to consider and that have now been considered. Added PFET level shift comment at end.
  [This comment is for anyone following this - NOT as an edit trace]. 

You do seem to be trying and have a general grasp of what is needed but, no rudeness intended, the circuit shows several signs of very major lack of design. You need to think things through MUCH more carefully.Fine detail cannot be looked at until you get the basic circuit details correct. As shown it will not work AT ALL for several major reasons. 

Drive polarity wrong:    The IC is able to be configured as a buck converter but as shown the output drive is of the wrong polarity if you use a P Channel high side switch and of the wrong voltage swing if you use an N Channel high side switch - see below. If using a P Channel MOSFET (which would be normal here) the output drive needs an inverter in it. As shown it will not work.

Level translator needed in driver:       If you DO run the IC off a 12V supply (and Vdd max = 15V) then the inverting driver which you have not yet got also needs to level translate as the MOSFET is high side and gate drive needs to go to 30V or whatever for MOSFET turn off. While addressing that do also ensure that MOSFET Vgs max is not exceeded when driving.

FET is wrong type          The MOSFET is nice enough BUT is N Channel (as befits the incorrect topology that you are using). An N channel MOSFET COULD be used there but the gate would need to be driven above V+ rail and you would need a gate drive supply. The overwhelmingly usual thing to do would be to use a P Channel MOSFET as the switch

Output diode      The output diode is very nice but is ""overkill"". The high max voltage leads also to higher than necessary forward operating voltage. You can probably get a few % more efficiency end to end with a lower voltage Schottky.

At a glance without pouring over the details the IC looks competent and should be capable of good efficiency as a buck regulator. I'd expect 90-95% to be achievable once the circuit was correct. 



Driving high side PFET.

Vin max = 32 V (specified).
 Vdd Ic = 12V (user specified) or 15V abs max.

PFET will have a Vgs max. Above that you get magic smoke.
 As PFET source is connected to Vin+ the Vgs is measure relative to Vin+.
 PFET gate can be driven low BELOW Vin+ by Vgsmax - ideally a bit less.

FET's that are not logic FETS often have Vgsmax of 20 to 25V.
 Most FETs are totally ""enhanced"" (aka turned fully on) by the time they have Vgs = 12V - see curves for FET of choice.
 Let's set Vgs max actual   = -12V relative to Vin+.
 This means that when Vin+ = 32V, Vgs may range from about 32V (FET is off) to 32-12 = 20V (FET is hard on).
 BUT available drive voltage at IC = 0-12V approx.
 So a level shifter is definitely needed.

5091,5091,8098,"With estimates of mass constraints on magnetic monopoles, how likely is one to be found by the LHC(MoEDAL)?","Fermilab seems to have ruled out monopoles with mass less than 850 GeV, but I have seen some estimates of the mass thought to be in the order of up to $10^{18}$ GeV, which, of course, would make them undetectable in any accelerators. By 2013, the LHC is scheduled to reach up to 14 TeV. The only disputed sighting of a cosmic ray produced magnetic monopole was in 1982 when Blas Cabrera reported discovering one (Valentine event monopole). This has never been duplicated. CERN has set up the Monopole and Exotics Detector MOEDAL. Other experiments set up to detect them are the Antarctic Impulsive Transient Antenna--ANITA, and the Antarctic Muon And Neutrino Detection Array, aka AMANDA. While both of these detected neutrinos, neither detected magnetic monopoles (looking for Cerenkov radiation produced by products of monopole interaction).
Another method of detection is to look for induced current in a superconducting ring when a monopole passes through.
Joseph Polchinski called the existence of monopoles “one of the safest bets that one can make about physics not yet seen.” This shows some optimism on his part that one will be seen. Is there any reason or way to limit the mass of the monopole on the upside to 14 TEV or less?
",Gordon ,https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/1495,"Dear Gordon, Polchinski didn't imply anything about the lightness of the monopoles. You are overinterpreting what he said: his statement was an in-principle statement by a theorist. Just to be sure, the MoEDAL collaboration has overinterpreted him, too: he has never suggested that an experiment of their kind will find the beast. Still, it's very important to know whether such qualitatively different particles exist even if we think it's very likely that they won't be directly detected in the near (or far) future. Most of the top contemporary state-of-the-art theoretical physics deals with objects that will probably never be detected by direct experiments, for obvious financial and technological limitations.

Directly experimentally, the lower bound on the mass is just 500 GeV or so, but when some theory is wisely added, the mass is pretty much required to be exponentially higher than the TeV scale. In particular, some kind of unification seems necessary to allow the magnetic monopoles, and unification such as GUT can only appear at very high scales, such as the GUT scale of $10^{16}$ GeV: that's where the electromagnetic $U(1)$ may be embedded in a larger group that allows a topologically nontrivial solution (the $SU(2)$ of the weak interactions is not enough - it doesn't contain the hypercharge which has to be twisted as well). So it's unlikely that direct detection succeeds. Inflation has probably diluted the concentration of those massive magnetic monopoles to a very tiny number.

4702,4702,7455,AES using derived keys / IVs. Does it introduce a weakness?,"I'm looking for an efficient way to encrypt multiple fields in a database with AES using a single global key, used throughout a large web application.

Obviously in order to re-use this key, a unique random IV is required for each field that is to be encrypted.

I'd rather not introduce more fields to the database to store each of these IVs, so the programatic approach seems to be to derive these IVs some how.

I'm toying with using either:

key = sha256(global_key + table_name)
iv = sha256(column_name + primary_key)


Or even simply:

key = global_key
iv = sha256(table_name + column_name + primary_key)


I'm leaning towards the former to generate per-table keys.

I've already read that the IVs do not need to be kept secret. So I'm working on the assumption that a derived key or IV (even if the algorithm becomes known), is no more insecure than any other non-secret IV, as long as the original key remains secret.

The question is:

Is there a fatal flaw in my approach? Am I introducing any serious weaknesses that, in the event that an adversary obtains a copy of the database, would make it easier for them to retrieve the plaintext data?

",Leigh,https://security.stackexchange.com/users/1349,"I am assuming you are using CBC mode...

I would make the argument that this is a CWE-329 violation.  The IV can be known the to attacker,  but it must be random.   A more common solution to your problem is just to store a very secure random value and use this as your ""IV"".

Lets say you have a table named ""secret"".  The attacker has a SQL Injection vulnerability and sees this table,  he can also see that the current primary key value.  By computing a simple sha256 hash he is able to predict the next IV,  or even per-compute a table of future IVs.  (Depending on your platform the SQL Injection vulnerability could be turned into a decryption oracle!  Nasty!)

If I where building this I would use a proper Key Derivation Function such as PBKDF2. These are heavier functions which make it more difficult for the attacker to ore-compute or calculate in mass.  It doesn't have to be much heavier,  but the resulting value does have to be the same size as your cipher.

Another possible solution is to have an global ""IV secret"".  Pass iv_secret + column_name + primary_key to your Key derivation function to produce your IV. Due to the use of a secret the IV is no longer a predictable value and this is no longer a CWE-329 violation.  Further more this value is also a nonce,  it is not likely that the same IV would be generated twice for two different values... (Unless you made an update,  which would be a violation).   To mitigate this you could add a ""version number"" or last-modified timestamp to the IV calculation.

","I am assuming you are using CBC mode...

I would make the argument that this is a CWE-329 violation.  The IV can be known the to attacker,  but it must be random.   A more common solution to your problem is just to store a very secure random value and use this as your ""IV"".

Lets say you have a table named ""secret"".  The attacker has a SQL Injection vulnerability and sees this table,  he can also see that the current primary key value.  By computing a simple sha256 hash he is able to predict the next IV,  or even per-compute a table of future IVs.  (Depending on your platform the SQL Injection vulnerability could be turned into a decryption oracle!  Nasty!)

If I where building this I would use a proper Key Derivation Function such as PBKDF2. These are heavier functions which make it more difficult for the attacker to ore-compute or calculate in mass.  It doesn't have to be much heavier,  but the resulting value does have to be the same size as your cipher.

Another possible solution is to have an global ""IV secret"".  Pass iv_secret + column_name + primary_key to your Key derivation function to produce your IV. Due to the use of a secret the IV is no longer a predictable value and this is no longer a CWE-329 violation.  Further more this value is also a nonce,  it is not likely that the same IV would be generated twice for two different values... (Unless you made an update,  which would be a violation).   To mitigate this you could add a ""version number"" or last-modified timestamp to the IV calculation.

IP restrictions means that your server will refuse to pursue connections which are tagged with the wrong IP address. This does not protect the data against eavesdroppers.

Let me take an analogy: suppose that your connections are good old letters, with a destination address, and a sender address. The envelopes are transparent. The equivalent of IP restrictions is when the recipient refuses to even open, let alone respond to, envelopes which are not tagged with a ""known sender"" address. But nobody guarantees that the sender address written on the envelope is genuine; sending a letter with a fake sender address is easy. Of course, if I, an attacker, send a letter with your address as alleged sender, I won't see the response (unless I plunder your mailbox). But the recipient may have already have acted upon the letter contents, believing them to originate from you.

3774,3774,6007,Find Nearest Line Segments to Point,"Background

From a known Point, I require to establish the nearest surrounding ""visible perimeter"" against a table of MultiLineStrings, as shown on the diagram.

I've searched this site with a number of terms (e.g. minimum edge, minimum perimeter, nearest neighbour, clip, containing polygon, visibility, snap, cut nodes, ray-trace, flood fill, inner boundary, routing, concave hull) but cannot find any previous question which seems to match this scenario.

Diagram


The green circle is the known Point.
The black lines are the known MultiLineStrings.
The grey lines are an indication of a radial sweep from the known Point.
The red points are the nearest intersection of the radial sweep and the MultiLineStrings.




Parameters


The Point will never intersect the MultiLineStrings.
The Point will always be nominally centred within the MultiLineStrings.
The MultiLineStrings will never fully enclose the Point, therefore the perimeter will be a MultiLineString.
There will be a table containing approximately 1,000 MultiLineStrings (normally containing a single line of about 100 points).


Methodology Considered


Undertake a radial sweep by constructing a series of lines from the known Point (at, say, 1 degree increments).
Establish the nearest intersection point of each radial sweep line with the MultiLineStrings.
When one of the radial sweep lines doesn't intersect with any of the MultiLineStrings, this would indicate a gap in the perimeter which would be accommodated in the perimeter MultiLineString construction.


Summary

Whilst this technique will find the nearest intersections, it won't necessarily find all the closest perimeter node points, dependent on the resolution of the radial sweep. Can anyone recommend an alternative method to establish all the perimeter points or supplement the radial sweep technique with some form of buffering, sectoring or offsetting?

Software

My preference is to use SpatiaLite and/or Shapely for the solution but would welcome any suggestions which could be implemented using open source software.

The ideas of heaven are very exciting: that we won't be just sitting around playing harps, but will live much like we do currently, although without the corruption of sin and in the presence of God.

Another exciting theme in these books is that the work we do here matters towards the new heaven and new earth, and will be redeemed and made full when God comes.

","The unique attribute is only used when generating a DDL schema from a mapping (hbm).

If you want to check uniqueness with NHibernate, it is data validation and you should look NHibernate validator.
And as Rafael said you have to write your own validator.

You can also check the natural-id element.

Unless you absolutely need to validate uniqueness on application side, this sample and this one make me think it may be better to let the database do this job.

",Steg Verner,https://stackoverflow.com/users/4360034,"The most efficient way to remove an element from a vector is the back-swap trick, but this only applies if you don't care about order.

If you know there are going to be many deletes or a very large vector, you may retain efficiency by using this trick, remembering not to ++ your current iterator after doing a delete, and std::sort()ing the vector when you reach the end.

Here's a cleanup of your code for readability, I also ditched your end captures because ... you are deleting elements.

using vec_t = std::vector&lt;uint32_t&gt;;
using vecpair_t = std::pair&lt;vec_t, vec_t&gt;;
using pairvec_t = std::vector&lt;vecpair_t&gt;;

    pairvec_t pairV1V2;
    for(auto itm = pairV1V2.begin(); itm != pairV1V2.end(); ++itm)
    {
        //Outer values
        auto&amp; outerV1 = itm-&gt;first; // NOTE '&amp;' - reference not copy!
        auto&amp; outerV2 = itm-&gt;second;
        sort(outerV2.begin(), outerV2.end());
        for(auto itm2 = itm + 1; itm2 != pairV1V2.end(); ++itm2)
        {
            auto&amp; innerV1 = itm2-&gt;first;
            auto&amp; innerV2 = itm2-&gt;second;
            vec_t setDiffV1;


As for another way to optimize this - since your lists are sorted - walk both lists at the same time comparing values.

template&lt;typename ValueType&gt;
void dedupe_vectors(
    typename std::vector&lt;ValueType&gt;&amp; lhs,
    typename std::vector&lt;ValueType&gt;&amp; rhs
    )
{
    auto lit = lhs.begin();
    auto rit = rhs.begin();
    while (rit != rhs.end) {
        while (lit != lhs.end() &amp;&amp; *lit &lt; *rit)
            ++lit;
        if (lit == lhs.end())
            break;
        if (*lit == *rit) {
            v2.erase(rit);
            continue;
        }  
        ++rit;
    }
}


I know - we test lit vs lhs.end twice. Take a look at the code your compiler generates with -O3 and see if it doesn't detect this itself. If so, then you can worry about optimizing it.

Can someone please help me in improving my present code -- it gives the correct answer (In the example I might have missed a few case for brevity-- but the code handles all of them) but is extremely slow (as diagonalised by perf). I'll be grateful if improvements are suggestion in my present piece of code. However, if the logic of the two codes are same, then a new algorithm is also acceptable
","The most efficient way to remove an element from a vector is the back-swap trick, but this only applies if you don't care about order.

#include &lt;vector&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;

int main()
{
    std::vector&lt;int&gt; v { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 };
    auto it = v.begin() + 5;
    // replace the current element with the back of the vector,
    // then shrink the size of the vector by 1.
    *it = std::move(v.back());
    v.pop_back();

    for (auto n : v) {
        std::cout &lt;&lt; n &lt;&lt; "" "";
    }
    std::cout &lt;&lt; ""\n"";
}


http://ideone.com/0jbWHZ

If you know there are going to be many deletes or a very large vector, you may retain efficiency by using this trick, remembering not to ++ your current iterator after doing a delete, and std::sort()ing the vector when you reach the end.

--- Edit ---

#include &lt;algorithm&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;vector&gt;

//! Efficiently remove an element from a vector without
//! preserving order. If the element is not the last element
//! in the vector, transfer the last element into its position
//! using a move if possible.
//! Regardless, we then shrink the size of the vector deleting
//! the element at the end, which will either be destructed or
//! the element we were deleting.
//! @note: Effectively invalidates the current iterator.

bool unstable_remove(
    typename std::vector&lt;ValueType&gt;&amp; container,
    typename std::vector&lt;ValueType&gt;::iterator it
    )
{
    // Leave in-situ if we are already the tail element.
    auto lastEl = container.end() - 1;
    if (it != lastEl) {
        // overwrite this element with what is in the last,
        // which should have the same effect as deleting this.
        *it = std::move(*lastEl);
    }
    // release the last cell of the vector, because it should
    // now either be destructed or contain the value we were
    // deleting.
    container.pop_back();
}

int main()
{
    std::vector&lt;int&gt; ints { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 };
    auto it = ints.begin();
    while (it != ints.end()) {
        if ((*it % 3) == 0) {
            unstable_remove(ints, it);
            // do not pass go / ++it

Here's a cleanup of your code for readability, I also ditched your end captures because ... you are deleting elements.

#include &lt;vector&gt;
#include &lt;cstdint&gt;

using vec_t = std::vector&lt;uint32_t&gt;;
using vecpair_t = std::pair&lt;vec_t, vec_t&gt;;
using pairvec_t = std::vector&lt;vecpair_t&gt;;

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
    pairvec_t pairV1V2;
    for(auto itm = pairV1V2.begin(); itm != pairV1V2.end(); ++itm)
    {
        //Outer values
        auto&amp; outerV1 = itm-&gt;first; // NOTE '&amp;' - reference not copy!
        auto&amp; outerV2 = itm-&gt;second;
        sort(outerV2.begin(), outerV2.end());
        for(auto itm2 = itm + 1; itm2 != pairV1V2.end(); ++itm2)
        {
            auto&amp; innerV1 = itm2-&gt;first;
            auto&amp; innerV2 = itm2-&gt;second;
            vec_t setDiffV1;


As for another way to optimize this - since your lists are sorted - walk both lists at the same time comparing values.

template&lt;typename ValueType&gt;
void dedupe_vectors(
    typename std::vector&lt;ValueType&gt;&amp; lhs,
    typename std::vector&lt;ValueType&gt;&amp; rhs
    )
{
    auto lit = lhs.begin();
    auto rit = rhs.begin();
    while (rit != rhs.end) {
        while (lit != lhs.end() &amp;&amp; *lit &lt; *rit)
            ++lit;
        if (lit == lhs.end())
            break;
        if (*lit == *rit) {
            v2.erase(rit);
            continue;
        }  
        ++rit;
    }
}


I know - we test lit vs lhs.end twice. Take a look at the code your compiler generates with -O3 and see if it doesn't detect this itself. If so, then you can worry about optimizing it.

I'm going to be in a public area taking portraits of many people (for example, at a themed, public event, or while doing a 100 Strangers Project, etc..)

After taking someone's portrait, I want them to give them access to their portrait (and only theirs, not everyone else's).

So, given all the pictures I take that day, how can I keep track of all the photos (matching up them up with their portrait, and then providing them a way to see/share the photo)? Also, what token, if any, could I give them to find or receive their photo later on?

The ideal solution for me would


give them access to only their portrait
minimize the amount of personal information I get from them at the time of encounter (a name only, for example. The assumption is that people would not want to give out their contact information.)
minimize wasting their time (in other words, be a socially elegant solution)
maximize the amount of time I spend shooting while I'm out ""in the field"" as opposed to bookkeeping

If you don't have a lightbox, you could buy one (cheap), or you can use some white paper to reflect the light onto the subject.

",Ashitakalax,https://diy.stackexchange.com/users/6182,"National Electrical Code (Article 250.20 section A) defines ""Low Voltage"" as it applies to home distribution systems as less than 50 volts.


  (A) AC Systems of Less Than 50 V. Alternating-current systems that
  operate at less than 50 V are not required to be grounded unless:
      (1) The primary exceeds 150 V to ground
      (2) The primary is ungrounded


This includes systems such as cable television, network and telephone, doorbell, etc. Note that standard telephone wiring can typically ""ring"" at 48 volts and still provide an electric shock.

The reason the code makes the distinction for low voltage is so that some types of wiring can be exempt from additional safety requirements such as conduit usage, breakers, installation method, etc. Even so, there are still violations where installers confuse the issue (Top ten violations in low voltage systems PDF).

There are (to my knowledge) no current limits for data lines, except for the rating of the cable itself. Since most UTP network and telco cables use 24 or 26 gauge wire, this would theoretically be around 3.5 amperes, but you have to consider length, temperature, etc. to properly determine current load (discussion at allaboutcircuits).

EDIT

Guessing that you might be wanting to use data lines for higher power applications, I thought I'd add some additional commentary. If you are wanting to use Cat5 for power-over-ethernet applications, you'll probably want to stay under 1A or less per conductor. This is because of the voltage drop and resistance on longer distances. Keep in mind that higher voltages are more suitable for transmission (longer distances) as long as you stay under the 50V ""low voltage"" specification. Even though charts show that 24AWG can carry 3.5A, I wouldn't consider this safe unless working with a very short cable. Power-over-ethernet standards are confusing, but generally they are 48 volts or less at 600mA or less.

Configuration is complicated enough that I'm not sure if I should replicate all of the steps here, but I will mention that if you use
Homebrew
you can install msmtp using

brew install msmtp --with-macosx-keyring

Then the rest is just a matter of setting up the related configuration files

# this next line is crucial: you have to point to the correct security certificate for GMail.
# If this doesn't work, check the mstmp documentation
# at http://msmtp.sourceforge.net/documentation.html for help

# Set a default account
# You need to set a default account for Mail
account default : example@gmail.com

# end msmtprc


Note that tls_trust_file line should point to wherever you have downloaded and installed the certificates from https://www.thawte.com/roots/index.html.

I put mine in ~/Dropbox/Thawte Roots so that I can have it on all of my Macs.

Then you need a ~/.mailrc file to say where the msmtp binary is located. If you use brew it will be /usr/local/bin/msmtp so the file would look like this:

set sendmail=""/usr/local/bin/msmtp""


The last but crucial step is making sure your Keychain has the information exactly in the format that msmtp will expect it:

# this next line is crucial: you have to point to the correct security certificate for GMail.
# If this doesn't work, check the mstmp documentation
# at http://msmtp.sourceforge.net/documentation.html for help
#
# This next line should all be on one long line:
tls_trust_file /path/to/Thawte Roots/Thawte SSLWeb Server Roots/thawte Premium Server CA/Thawte Premium Server CA.pem

# Set a default account
# You need to set a default account for Mail
account default : example@gmail.com

# end msmtprc


Note that tls_trust_file line should point to wherever you have downloaded and installed the certificates from https://www.thawte.com/roots/index.html.

I put mine in ~/Dropbox/Thawte Roots so that I can have it on all of my Macs.

Then you need a ~/.mailrc file to say where the msmtp binary is located. If you use brew it will be /usr/local/bin/msmtp so the file would look like this:

set sendmail=""/usr/local/bin/msmtp""


The last but crucial step is making sure your Keychain has the information exactly in the format that msmtp will expect it:



I think that covers most of the details. See http://www.tuaw.com/2010/05/04/msmtp-a-free-tool-to-send-email-from-terminal/ if you want a few more specifics.

1047,1047,1646,How can I cut fudge smooth and uniform?,"I've recently taking up making fudge for family and friends.  However, my cutting technique lacks a desirable smooth uniform piece. How can I cut equal smooth cuts? 
",James,https://cooking.stackexchange.com/users/37194,"The first question is how fussy you want to be about uniformity.  Many people are satisfied just using a long, thin knife to score the fudge in roughly straight lines.

If you want professional-level uniformity in the size of pieces, you'll need to lay out a grid with a straightedge, measuring equal distances on all four sides, and then use the straightedge across the fudge to score it.  (If you plan on doing this repeatedly, I'd recommend preparing a template on a piece of cardboard or something, so you don't need to measure equal spacing on the edges each time.)

As for smooth cutting, there are standard recommendations: 


Score the grid onto the fudge with a sharp knife when just barely set but still warm.  This will make the final cuts easier, as well as giving you guidelines to follow.
Everyone has an opinion about the best implement to do the final cuts with.  If the fudge is still slightly warm (but firm), a plastic knife may work best.  If the fudge is cooler and harder, a thin smooth metal blade is often easiest (usually with no sawing motions; just pressing down).  A long blade makes for quicker work.  Some people like to use a bench knife pushed straight down; others use a pizza wheel or smooth pastry wheel.  It all depends on your technique, as well as the consistency and temperature of the fudge. 
If you have difficulty cutting or if the fudge crumbles with the cuts, try warming the metal knife (or wheel or whatever) in hot water between cuts.  Wipe the hot knife dry before cutting.
Whatever you use, always wipe the cutting implement clean between cuts.


Some people claim to use dental floss for cutting.  While I've used that for cakes a few times, it seems overly fussy and difficult for fudge (but I've never tried it), though you might consider using it for fast scoring.

First of all, it's probably 4px and not 4. Second, that's just the way the browser vendor decided should be the default.
It is saved in the default browser stylesheets.
You can, but you shouldn't. It differs with each browser. Google it! How do I change default stylesheet on &lt;insert browser here&gt;?
There probably are slight differences, you should be able to tell... by looking at the default stylesheets :)

4068,4068,6491,"Maximal ideal in $\mathbb{Q}[x,y]$","I am trying to prove that $(x,y)$ is a maximal ideal of $\mathbb{Q}[x,y]$. Since an ideal $I \subseteq R$ is maximal if and only if $R/I$ is a field, it suffices to prove that $\mathbb{Q}[x,y]/(x,y)$ is a field.
Let $\phi : \mathbb{Q}[x,y] \rightarrow \mathbb{Q}$ be the evaluation homomorphism that sends $p(x,y)$ to $p(0,0)$. $\phi$ is clearly surjective and if I prove that the kernel of $\phi$ is the ideal $(x,y)$, the result will follow by the First Isomorphism Theorem.    

$(x,y) \subseteq Ker(\phi)$ is obvious, but to prove the reverse inclusion, my idea is to take a polynomial $p(x,y) \in Ker(\phi)$ and to perform Euclidean division of $p(x,y)$ with $y$ and $x$ in $(\mathbb{Q}[x])[y]$ and $(\mathbb{Q}[y])[x]$ respectively. The problem is that neither of them is a polynomial ring over field. There is a theorem saying that if R is commutative and if $R[x]$ is a PID, then $R$ is a field. Since neither $\mathbb{Q}[x]$, nor $\mathbb{Q}[y]$ are fields, it follows that neither $(\mathbb{Q}[x])[y]$, nor $(\mathbb{Q}[y])[x]$ are PIDs, hence are not Euclidean domains.   

Obviously, Euclidean division does not solve the problem. If we consider $p(x,y)$ as an element in $(\mathbb{Q}[x])[y]$ and if we divide by $y$, then we get a quotient $q(x,y)$ and a remainder which is $0$ or of degree $0$ over $(\mathbb{Q}[x])[y]$, hence a polynomial $r(x)$ in $x$ only.    

Then, $p(x,y) = yq(x,y) + r(x)$ and the hypothesis $p(0,0)=0$ does not guarantee that $r(x)=0$. So, we cannot conclude that $y$ divides $p(x,y)$.

Is there a way to remedy this proof, or is there another approach to this problem?

5943,5943,9417,Grinding sound during cold start?,"I have a 2009 Honda Accord.  Over the past several months, I've noticed a grinding sound immediately after cold-starting the engine.  It only lasts for a fraction of a second, doesn't continue once the engine is running, and doesn't happen if I shut the engine off and start it again a few minutes later.

A little background:

The car has 92,000 miles on it.  I've noticed that it burns oil pretty quickly, so I keep an eye on it and make sure to add more if needed.  Most recently, I got an oil change with a high mileage synthetic, but that has not solved the issue.

Does anyone know what this could be?  Is it a big deal?  I'm obviously worried about damaging the engine.  Is this a major thing?  Or is it something I can live with, provided I don't mind the frightening noise that occurs on startup.

Any help you can give is greatly appreciated!

1471,1471,2315,"What benefits do ""title search companies"" have over physically visiting a land records offices?","I am looking into buying my first piece of real property.

Basically my question is ""why do title search companies even exist?"". Who uses them? And why?

Are they doing something special apart from going to the local authoritative body and performing a title search on a parcel id number?

A) Am I paying them just so they can do my due dilligence and then stamp some big ole company seal on the documents they provided me with? So I feel more confident in the documentation provided?

B) Do they exist solely to service large banks and corporations who control thousands of property deeds worldwide and cannot afford to pay a staffer in every single city on earth just to perform title searches?

C) Or might they exist for some other reason that I am entirely unaware of?

I am not trying to be facetious. I am genuinely curious. As somebody who has never looked into the process of acquiring land in the past, they seem to be redundant as a service. I can't imagine how so many of them are still in business.



Take Detroit, MI for example.

There is a website called https://www.waynecountylandrecords.com (which is run by the city of Detroit) where I can go and pay them $6 for 15 minutes of access to perform as many property title searches as I can manage in 15 minutes. It costs $2 per page to print (download) documents from that database, up to a maximum of $10 per document.

That, or I could physically visit the land records office listed on their website and do the same thing in person. Although it would cost me a bit more money I believe.



So again my question is why would I spend more money with a title search company as opposed to performing the title search myself?

Is it simply because ""performing a title search"" requires the ability to circumnavigate a bunch of legal mumbo jumbo or even know where to perform the title search in the first place? I am quite distraught over the (what seem to me to be) unnessary complications involved in purchasing a property.

I'll be frank. I create and maintain extremely large computer databases for a living. So the idea of paying somebody $25+ to basically extract data from a database and then pass it on to me seems asinine.

The sole fact that a city like Detroit Michigan is placing a pay wall of $6 to even perform an online title search seems ludicrous to me as well. Seeing as it's in their best interest to give potential investors full and complete knowledge of any liens on the literally thousands of properties they are in need of having purchased by tax-paying individuals. For what? A few $100k in annual revenue for the City? But, I digress.

I do understand that it's literally a thousand+ year old system, so I carry on in search of knowledge.

If I absolutely have to go through a title search company to receive the full benefits of a title search, please explain why below.

",islandlubber64,https://money.stackexchange.com/users/15087,"Title agencies perform several things:


Research the title for defects. You may not know what you're looking at, unless you're a real-estate professional, but some titles have strings attached to them (like, conditions for resale, usage, changes, etc).
Research title issues (like misrepresentation of ownership, misrepresentation of the actual property titled, misrepresentation of conditions). Again, not being a professional in the domain, you might not understand the text you're looking at.
Research liens. Those are usually have to be recorded (i.e.: the title company won't necessarily find a lien if it wasn't recorded with the county).
Cover your a$$. And the bank's. They provide title insurance that guarantees your money back if they missed something they were supposed to find. The title insurance is usually required for a mortgaged transaction.


While I understand why you would think you can do it, most people cannot. Even if they think they can - they cannot. In many areas this research cannot be done online, for example in California - you have to go to the county recorder office to look things up (for legal reasons, in CA counties are not allowed to provide access to certain information without verification of who's accessing). It may be worth your while  to pay someone to do it, even if you can do it yourself, because your time is more valuable.

Also, keep in mind that while you may trust your abilities - your bank won't. So you may be able to do your own due diligence - but the bank needs to do its own.

968,968,1534,"Javascript arrays: Given array[n], get array[n*m]","I'd like to know which would be the best way to solve this problem using javascripts native array methods(map,reduce,etc.). 

Given an array of n objects I want to create another array that will contain m objects for each element in the original array. I can do it using common ""for"" loops to iterate the array but I'd like to know if it can be solved with the native array methods.

Example case:

I have an array with n elements of like ""ObjectA"":

var objectA = {
       name: ""xxx"",
       tels: [""yyy"",""zzz""]
};


I would like to get another array of objects of type ""ObjectB"":

var objectB = {
       name: ""xxx"",
       tel: ""yyy""
};


So in this case, if the first array contained only objectA, the desired result would be:

[
   {
      name: ""xxx"",
      tel: ""yyy""
   },
   {
      name: ""xxx"",
      tel: ""zzz""
   }
]


I've tried using two nested ""map"" calls, but the callback function can only return one element. 

var array1 = [objectA];

var array2 = array1.map(function(objectA){
   return objectA.tels.map(function(tel){
      return {
                 name : objectA.name,
                 tel : tel
              };
   });
});


Returning another array in the callback, generates an array of arrays and it's not what I want. Array2 result:

[
   [
      {
         name: ""xxx"",
         tel: ""yyy""
      },
      {
         name: ""xxx"",
         tel: ""zzz""
      }

3403,3403,5425,How can I keep Mail.app's archive from becoming too big?,"I'm trying to reduce my hard drive space used to prepare for a move to an SSD. I've got a wonderful application called DaisyDisk that allows me to visualize data segments on my hard drives.

I have three internal drives, and for the time being I'd just like to slim down the size of my startup disk, so I can move it to a smaller SSD.

By far the largest segment of my hard drive is a section under Macintosh HD/Users/joelglovier/library/Mail/V2/Mailboxes. This directory is over 75GB. You can see the visualization from DaisyDisk here: http://cl.ly/E7OJ

I found this directory before, when trying to slim down my hard drive, and simply deleted it's contents, then changed my settings in Mail.app to not archive attachments, thinking that would resolve the issue.

However, some months later this directory has again creeped up to a ginormous size.

Can anybody please help me understand what this directory is for, and how to permanently reduce it's size - via Mail.app settings, or whatever I need to change to stop it from becoming so huge.

Thank you!

Note: I'm on OSX Lion 10.7.3 using Mail.app ver 5.2.

EDIT: SO I dug through the files in the directory in question. There was one particular mailbox in /Library/Mail/V2/Mailboxes called ""Recovered Messages (account name).mbox"" which contained a very strange subdirectory structure of a single email duplicated thousands of times under different subdirectory structures. For example, there was a subdirectory in it that had /1, /2, /3, etc., and each one of those directories had /attachments and /messages. The /attachments on each had hundreds of subdirectories each containing this one same attachement from a particular email, and the /messages under each had hundreds of copies of the email all with different numerical file names. But the weird thing is ALL were from the same exact email.
",Joel Glovier,https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/1261,"Go ahead and delete that ""recovered"" folder, and there is also going to be an .OfflineCache folder that needs to be removed.  Note the period at the beginning of the file name; you will either need to show invisible files or use Terminal to delete that folder.

This most often happens when an unsuitable large file is attached to a message.  With GMail for example, any attachment over 20MB will be rejected.  Mail sees the rejection by the mail server and tries to recover from it by sending the message again.  Over time, these half-attempts to send mail stack up and start using all your drive space.

",Zeb,https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/users/10852,"This is largely a matter of opinion; these are two different languages with their own strengths and weaknesses.

That said, the rpi community seems very partial to python, and so you have various python libraries for doing pi (or: linux based GPIO dev board) specific things.  If you are interested in connecting I2C devices from retailers like adafruit, there is often python helper code and corresponding tutorials.

However, you don't actually need python to do any of that.  The I2C interface is a native C API (and very very simple), so if you know C, you could incorporate than into Java via the JNI, which someone else has already done (so if you don't know C, you should be able to use that).

As explained here the GPIO interface uses file nodes and is therefore in fact language agnostic: other than basic I/O, you don't need any additional libraries at all.

So there's nothing you can do in python in the pi that you can't do in java as well.  My personal suggestion, if you don't already know one of the big 3 ""dynamically typed object oriented"" languages -- python, perl, and ruby1 -- is to try one.   Java is great, but dynamic typing is a very interesting contrast and knowing one of those (my own preference is perl) is definitely worthwhile.

2959,2959,4706,Probability density function with conditional distribution and correlation,"I am unsure with question c/d/e/f but I will give my answers for all questions I have attempted.

The random variables $X$ and $Y$ have joint probability density function

$f_{X,Y}(x,y) = ke^{-(x+y)},\ x&gt;0,\ y&gt;0,\ 0&lt;x&lt;y.$

(a) Sketch the region over which the joint probability density function is non-zero.

(b) Show that $k = 2.$

(c) Find the marginal Distribution of $X$; name the distribution and state its mean and variance.

(d) Find the conditional distribution of $Y|X = x$ for $x&gt;0$. Pay particular attention to the range of $Y$ conditional on $x$.

(e) Calculate $Pr(X + Y&lt;1)$.

(f) Given that $E(Y) = 1.5$ and $Var(Y) = 1.25$, calculate the correlation between $X$ and $Y$.

ANSWERS:

(a) Don't know how to draw on here but it's the area above $y=x$ and $y&gt;0$.

(b) Here I used double integration

$\int_0^\infty \int_0^y ke^{-(x+y)}dxdy = 1$

$\int_0^\infty [-ke^{-(x+y)}]_0^y dy = \int_0^\infty[-ke^{-y}+ke^{-2y}]dy$

$[ke^{-y}-\frac{k}{2}e^{-2y}]_0^\infty = [ke^{-0} - \frac{k}{2}e^{-2\cdot0}]-[ke^{-\infty}-\frac{k}{2}e^{-2\cdot \infty}] = [k - \frac{k}{2}]-[0] = \frac{k}2$

Hence $\frac{k}{2}=1$ and $k=2$

(c) $P_x(x)=\int_yP_{X,Y}(x,y)dy=\int_0^\infty2e^{-(x+y)}dy$

$[-2e^{-(x+y)}]_0^\infty= -2e^{-x}$

Presuming that the integration I have done is correct the marginal distribution of $X$ is $-2e^{-x}$ and hence this is a gamma distribution as the limits are $(0,\infty)$ and it just doesn't match the binomial distribution either.

Gamma distribution: $\frac{1}{\Gamma(\alpha)\cdot \beta^\alpha}\cdot x^{\alpha-1}\cdot e^{-\frac{x}{\beta}}$

Hence $\frac{1}{\Gamma(\alpha)\cdot \beta^\alpha}\cdot x^{\alpha-1}\cdot e^{-\frac{x}{\beta}} = -2e^{-x}$

This is where I have gone wrong as using $\beta = 1$ to leave $e^{-x}$ as that i then need to find:

$\frac{1}{\Gamma(\alpha)\cdot 1^\alpha}\cdot x^{\alpha-1} = -2$ and using $\alpha =1$ to make $x^0$ and getting rid of $x$ but this makes $1=-2$.

(d) unsure how to do this question also.

(e) Adding the line $y=1-x$ to the graph from *(a)*we get a new region to find

$\int_0^1 \int_x^{1-x}2e^{-(x+y)}dydx$

$\int_0^1[-2e^{-(x+y)}]_x^{1-x}dx$

$\int_0^1[(-2e^{-2x})-(-2e^{-1})]dx$

$[e^{-2x}+2xe^{-1}]_0^1$

$e^0 + 0 - e^{-2} + 2e^{-1} = 1-\frac{1}{e^2}+\frac{2}{e}$

Hence $Pr(x+y&lt;1) = 1-\frac{1}{e^2}+\frac{2}{e}$

(f) Unsure how to do.
",Matt,https://math.stackexchange.com/users/45783,"On (c), we want to ""integrate out"" $y$. So the density function of $X$ is
$$\int_{y=x}^\infty 2e^{-x}e^{-y}\,dy.$$
Integration yields $2e^{-x}e^{-x}$. So $X$ has exponential distribution, parameter $2$.  

On (d), recall that the conditional density of $Y$ given that $X=x$ is
$$\frac{f_{X,Y}(x,y)}{f_X(x)}.$$
Note that the conditional density is $0$ for $y\lt x$.

On (e), the setup is good. There is a small sign error in the calculation. The number obtained is impossible, it is greater than $1$.

On (f), we will first need the covariance, that is, $E(XY)-E(X)E(Y)$. For that, we need to find 
$$\iint_D (xy) 2e^{-(x+y)}\,dydx,$$
where $D$ is the region where our joint density is positive.

","On (c), we want to ""integrate out"" $y$. So the density function of $X$ is
$$\int_{y=x}^\infty 2e^{-x}e^{-y}\,dy.$$
Integration yields $2e^{-x}e^{-x}$. So $X$ has exponential distribution, parameter $2$.  

On (d), recall that the conditional density of $Y$ given that $X=x$ is
$$\frac{f_{X,Y}(x,y)}{f_X(x)}.$$
Note that the conditional density is $0$ for $y\lt x$.

On (e), the setup is good. There is a small sign error in the calculation. The number obtained is impossible, it is greater than $1$.

On (f), we will first need the covariance, that is, $E(XY)-E(X)E(Y)$. For that, we need to find 
$$\iint_D (xy) 2e^{-(x+y)}\,dydx,$$
where $D$ is the region where our joint density is positive.

3127,3127,4980,"Biscuit, dowel or simple braces for making unit top with inset lid and slim sides?","I've had 5 pieces of iroko machined for creating a top to my DIY TV lift, complete with a lid for the TV to pop up through:



The dimensions are based on the pre-existing cabinet, and the lid size needed for the TV to rise up. I was originally taking my cue from this YouTube video wherein he joins his (very long) pieces with biscuits; however now I have my pieces I'm concerned that:


The two sides are too slim to really hold the whole thing together with any strength (as I imagine I could only use one biscuit on each side);
The boards may be relatively slim (20mm) and as such need small biscuits or dowels, compounding point 1.


Bearing in mind that a) I'm a total novice, and b) I don't own a biscuit-cutter, I was wondering whether a far easier solution might be to use one or two 'braces' (apologies if this is not the correct term) running on the underside of the lid, on either side, joining the front and back pieces and spanning the shorter side pieces. These would be hidden inside the unit once the lid is in place, so it shouldn't affect the look.

Although the top isn't structural, it should still be solid and sound, and most likely need to at least bear the weight of a graceless cat who will hurl his body at any piece of furniture like a sack of potatoes.

",indextwo,https://diy.stackexchange.com/users/12154,"Honestly for solid wood boards (hardwood in your case) just applying wood glue and clamping would provide more than sufficient strength to hold the weight of a cat. Simple glue joints are used to make table tops without additional fasteners. The strength of the glue joint is generally stronger than the wood itself and since your boards have already been machined they provide great gluing surfaces. Just don't clamp so hard you squeeze out all the glue.

20mm (a little more than 3/4"") is plenty thick to use most fastening systems including biscuits or dowels. Biscuits you need a special bicuit cutting tool which can be expensive. Dowels benefit from a jig to get them to line up properly. My personal choice is to use pocket screw holes for applications like this. 

A Kreg Mini jig will suffice for your needs as long as you have a power drill and only costs about $13 and you don't need expensive bar clamps as you would with glue alone but a face clamp would benefit to keep everything flush. You can also just use standard quick clamps though. I use mine frequently but there are more advanced models that make positioning easier. I have comparisons of the different Kreg Jig models on my site.

The way I would do it is to drill the pocket screw holes on the undersides of the boards using 3 screws on each side, 1 of which is screwed onto the long board. 2 screws per side would be adequate but I like to have some on the alternate board for glueups like this.

4239,4239,6760,What is the difference between a telephoto lens and a zoom lens?,"Looking at the product page for Nikon lenses, I notice a distinction between telephoto lens and zoom lens.

What is the difference between the two?  Why would I want one over the other?  I wiki'd telephoto lens but remain confused about this distinction.

Please talk to me like I'm stupid. :) I am hoping for a completely lay explanation.  In particular, I'd like to understand in what situations I'd use a telephoto lens, and in what (other) situations I'd use a zoom lens.
",Kirk Woll,https://photo.stackexchange.com/users/4477,"Telephoto and zoom are two completely different things.  Zoom simply means that the focal length (apparent magnification) of the lens can be changed, ie, it looks like it can look at things either closer up or further away by adjusting it.  

Telephoto, roughly, means that the lens has a relatively narrow field of view, thus it can be used to look at things further away.

Telephoto lenses can be either zoom or prime.  Zoom means that they can change how far they are looking at or prime means they have a fixed amount of magnification and can't be altered.  (Like an old instant camera with no zoom, but with much better picture quality.)  The reason for using a prime is that they are a) cheaper and b) produce much, much higher quality images for the price.

Similarly, a zoom lens can be in any part of the focal length spectrum.  You can have a 17-40mm zoom, which is basically wide angle (and not at all telephoto) or you can have a 100-400 zoom, which is entirely telephoto.  You can also have any variety of different combinations including things like 24-250mm lenses that span from wide angle all the way to telephoto in one lens.

there could not be a isomorphism between the two rings because there would be no one to one or onto mapping between the two rings. but could there be an operation preserving mapping between an integral domain and a commutative ring with unity and with zero divisors? 
clearly if such a mapping did exists it would not seem to be one to one or onto, but does this rule out the potential of a homomorphism existing between the two?

3172,3172,5052,How to remember 10 last read articles with timestamp in session for a user in Codeigniter?,"I would like to make a PHP if condition code that will check if the last 10 articles or 10 minutes from the article reading by the user have already elapsed.

E.g. 

A user open a page with id = 235 (this id value is in the url localhost/article/235 )

and this id value will be saved in session with a current timestamp and maybe his IP address

Then he read another article and the same will happen.

I need to remember the clicked stuff for another ten clicks and then reset that only for the first row. E.g. after the 10th click the id and timestamp will not became 11th row but will replace the 1st row in the list.

The php condition in CodeIgniter will then check these values and will update the article hit counter value in the articles table and column counter like this:   

   $this-&gt;db-&gt;where('id', $id);
   $this-&gt;db-&gt;set('counter', 'counter+1', FALSE);
   $this-&gt;db-&gt;update('articles');


But before calling this code I need to make this check from the session?

How to do that?

I think storing e.g. 10 entries in the session with timestamps per user will be enough.

Just don't save the same page in the session twice.

And the condition will check the current timestamp with the saved one and if it is more than e.g. 10 minutes or the user have read/clicked another 10 articles it will allow the update counter php code.

I don't need to have this bulletproof. Just to disable the increment using browser's refresh button. 

So, if he wants to increment the counter he will need to wait ten minutes or read another 10 articles ;)

3216,3216,5131,How does Christianity deal with biblical criticism related to the Old Testament?,"As an orthodox Jew I have seen quite a stir lately regarding the topic of biblical criticism, specifically towards the Old Testament (Torah). 

I have perused several questions in this stack which seem to address this topic in general, and learned a lot about apologetics, but I have not seen answers that address some of the major claims of biblical criticism, especially as it pertains to the Old Testament. 

For example:


The story of Noah and the flood seems to be contradicted by archaeological evidence as well as having been 'borrowed' from earlier flood narratives such as the Gilgamesh story
Many of the portions of the Old Testament seem to be borrowed from earlier near eastern texts such as the Hammurabi code

",user5796,https://christianity.stackexchange.com/users/5796,"In short, how does Christianity deal with some of the major contentions of biblical criticism towards the Old Testament?

The literalists contend the academic assertions are false (intentionally or otherwise). The accommodationists attempt to find a way to build a compromise usually at the expense of what is written in the Bible.

This is similar to what passes for science these days in regard to evolution. However with literary criticism the flaws are more apparent.

For example, the assertion of multiple authors is often based on the declaration of someone that they have detected a stylistic difference that ""proves"" that the same person could not have written a document attributed to him.

Using an example from evolutionary ""science"", the measurement of something like ice cores is hindered by the fact that the weight of the ice causes anything more than a few centuries old to be fused together. A person attempting to discover something beyond the point of differentiation has to make assumptions and interpret his measurements using ""fudge factors"".

Most people are bored by the details of both literary criticism and evolutionary science. They usually take at face value whatever the media tells them which is usually a distillation of what is popular or sensational.

As a literalist, I expect there to be accusations and declarations from a variety of sources against the Bible and God.

I have perused several questions in this stack which seem to address this topic in general, and learned a lot about apologetics, but I have not seen answers that address some of the major claims of biblical criticism, especially as it pertains to the Old Testament. 

For example:


The story of Noah and the flood seems to be contradicted by archaeological evidence as well as having been 'borrowed' from earlier flood narratives such as the Gilgamesh story
Many of the portions of the Old Testament seem to be borrowed from earlier near eastern texts such as the Hammurabi code

  Actor: Sorry, no, I don't do ""sad"". Unless it's ""cheesy sad""; I'm a comedian!
  
  Auditioner (to others): Did you hear that? We have a clown here (which I mean literally as well as pejoratively) who says he doesn't do ""sad"", unless it is ""cheesy sad"".


Another example:


  A: I went on a date with a really intelligent guy, but he intellectualized every topic we talked about.
  
  B: I hear you. Intelligent is good. Nerdy: not so much.


We probably accept this kind of thing by imagining the word to be completely outside of the syntax, as if wrapped in quotes (which is why I wrote all the examples that way).

The ability to use pieces of language as nouns is necessary, because it allows us to talk about language. We can say things like:


  A: Blurchmoop!
  
  B: What on Earth is ""blurchmoop?""


Or:


  ""up on"" is a different preposition from ""upon"".


We cannot stop ourselves from saying sentences like these because we don't know the lexical category of blurchmoop, or because ""up on"" isn't a noun, and so cannot serve as the subject to the verb ""is"".

A piece of quoted language can serve as a noun, or even a verb, to make these kinds of sentences work, and as a byproduct, it lets us say things like ""awesome lives here"" or ""I'm with stupid"".

Also note that ""amazing"" can in fact be regarded as simply the gerund form of ""to amaze"".  Thus, ""where amazing happens"" can be interpreted similarly to ""where cooking happens"". However, this is not the interpretation which jumps out at me; and if I wanted to convey that meaning, I would say, ""where amazement happens"". Because ""amazing"" is a common adjective, we do not use the gerund form ""amazing"" in contexts where it is not clear that it cannot possibly be the adjective, such as, ""He goes around amazing everyone with his skill"".  So if ""where amazing happens"" is used by someone with the intent of invoking the gerund meaning, patterned after ""where cooking happens"", that someone must not be a native speaker of English. By dumb luck, however, that someone has created a glib phrase suitable for an advertizement.

Another thing: ""the amazing"" is definitely a noun.


  Every morning, Bob the Contortionist does the amazing; he bends over backwards and bites his own left ankle.


The slogan in the poster could be expressed as:


  Where The Amazing Happens


Finally, check this out. There are some adjectives in English that serve as nouns also, such as various -ible and -able words: convertible, deductible, dirigible, ...

Something can be convertible, and we can have ""a convertible"" and ""the convertible"".

Now imagine if such a word were used for something uncountable. For instance, gases are like liquids, but they are compressible. What if we coined the word ""compressible"" as a way to say ""gas""? 

Then we could quite perfectly say something like this, without any article ""the"" or ""a"":


  This pipe is where compressible escapes from the tank.


Which is not so different from ""where amazing happens"". So maybe ""where amazing happens"" is not that far fetched; perhaps we do not have to resort to hypotheses about quoted material being treated as a noun.

I am wondering if this slogan is a right expression. Amazing is an adjective without doubt, then how could it be used alone as a subject? I have thought this over and now I guess maybe it is acceptable using some simplified, less-grammatical expressions for news titles and slogans, isn't it?

 Equation 2.24 says, $$\tilde{H}(s) = (1-s)H_B + sH_P$$ which means the adiabatic evolution starts from the ground state of $H_B$ and slowly evolves until it arrives at the ground state of $H_P$. In section 3.1, the one qubit example has the adiabatic Hamiltonian as $$\tilde{H}(s) = \begin{pmatrix}

I don't see how the plot of Figure 1 is drawn. In figure 1, Farhi plotted eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian for s while the range for s was 0 to 1. The Hamiltonian is supposed to evolve according to the Schrodinger equation (eq 2.1), $$i \frac{d}{dt} |\Psi (t) \rangle = H(t) |\Psi (t) \rangle$$

These seem a good option but I would like to know more about them.

Where are these announced? How can one travel this way?
",nsn,https://travel.stackexchange.com/users/3736,"Private Aircraft

Others have answered for the commercial and chartered sectors, which is increasingly being strangled due to regulation.  This answer will focus on the private sector.  

Where are these announced? 

The short answer is they are not announced, at least publicly like on a web site. Any kind of advertising or public communication kicks them into the charter or commercial spheres. When you know that a private pilot is planning to fly, you can ask if he wants to take you along.  It's that simple.  

Meeting people and making personal contact replaces the internet.  I think it's OK to exchange emails with somebody who already knows you and met you personally or through a club, but they are not going to warm up to somebody out of the blue.  Also in terms of 'where are these announced', some discretion can be in order. If you go around identifying your contacts by name on your Facebook page, it may not be appreciated and you're likely to find your emails unanswered after that.

If you know something is on a pilot's bucket list, like flying a Nanchang CJ-6 (a vintage two seater on many dream bucket lists), you can keep your eyes open for that kind of opportunity.  Whatever gets you talking to pilots and in the air is key towards empty leg travel.

Another example...  In 2018, there will be a competition to fly around the world in Bristol Bulldogs.  For people who live on the route and are aware that Bulldogs need to land for maintenance and fuel at the drop of a hat, there's an opportunity to offer some hospitality and a quick tour of your city. 

A really great calling card is the ability to speak different languages and to let people know you're happy to translate.  I have also done pet-sitting, baby-sitting, driving, tour guiding, and cabin clean up/dish-washing.  Having multiple passports also gives you a slight edge because you don't face visa issues. 

How can one travel this way?

Some important things to point out about this...


Timing.  If you haven't done it before, it's not going to happen overnight unless you're very lucky. It takes a long time to get oriented and to establish yourself as an enthusiast. 
Flexibility. You don't always go exactly when you want and where you want. Instead, you go where the pilot is going and that may leave you with additional transportation to reach your destination - or even stranded for a while.  For example, a flight into Heathrow or Gatwick would be extraordinarily rare; the general case is  they are headed for a private airport like Cotswold or even as far out as Humberside.  There are about 20  - 25 airports in the greater London area and home counties, but not every type of plane is cleared for their type of strip(s).  On the plus side and if you are younger, being 'stranded' at some random field gives the opportunity to hang around the terminal and meet pilots who might be flying to some place else (note: I never went 'total gypsy' myself, but have spoken with people who managed to hop respectable distances over the course of say, a year; others have found that the demands of being flexible became unpleasant as they got older). 
Regulations.  It's getting worse and worse.  Airpooler is now moribund because of US regulations.  BlackJet was supposed to have Uber's business model, but now appears to be offering very expensive pay-only arrangements to avoid being shut down.  And the EU has jumped in with stricter interpretation of Regulation 965/2014, which is making some pilots reluctant to do anything at all unless they know you well.

You can attend events and festivals, like the annual one at Shobdon Field where anybody can go and enjoy the event while expressing enthusiasm for the sport.
You can be a volunteer in Project Orbis, or raise donations in a challenge event.  The Corporate Angel Network also takes in volunteers for data entry (with no direct path to flying) but leading to a wealth of knowledge about flight schedules, pilots, fractional owners, private car operators, airports, and all the rest.  
Check out newly converted or upgraded airports like Conington. Check out their engineering and repair facilities, what kinds of certifications they offer. Even Wifi and broadband. It's all useful knowledge.

  Possible Duplicate:
  Why avoid increment (&ldquo;++&rdquo;) and decrement (&ldquo;--&rdquo;) operators in JavaScript?  




I'm a big fan of Douglas Crockford and his excellent book, JavaScript: The Good Parts. I also use his JSLint tool on an hourly basis before checking in any code to our repository, as is good sense.

One thing I've noticed when running code through JSLint is its insistence that the ++ increment operator is somehow evil. I know I can turn certain rules off, but that's cheating ;). Crockford mentions his dislike on page 112 of JS: TGP...


  In my own practice, I observed that when I used ++ and --, my code tended to be too tight, too tricky, too cryptic. So, as a matter of discipline, I don't use them any more. I think that as a result, my coding style has become cleaner.


That's all very lovely, but he doesn't give any examples of the way he codes them now. I assume he's doing something like...

var i;
i = 0;
i = i + 1;


Again, great, but I've got a few basic 'for loops' in my JS code, as I imagine many people have, and I've always used the standard syntax...

for (i = 0; i &lt; myArray.length; i++) { 
    // Loop Stuff 
}


Am I missing something? What's the cleanest and/or best way to increment/decrement?
",Daniel Attfield,https://stackoverflow.com/users/545030,"In C/C++ this is important, especially with arbitrary iterators and pre/post increment semantics. Also, random access vs forward-iterators.

In Javascript it's more about aesthetics than anything else. Unless you're dealing with strings. ""1""+1 is ""11"".

  Why avoid increment (&ldquo;++&rdquo;) and decrement (&ldquo;--&rdquo;) operators in JavaScript?  




I'm a big fan of Douglas Crockford and his excellent book, JavaScript: The Good Parts. I also use his JSLint tool on an hourly basis before checking in any code to our repository, as is good sense.

One thing I've noticed when running code through JSLint is its insistence that the ++ increment operator is somehow evil. I know I can turn certain rules off, but that's cheating ;). Crockford mentions his dislike on page 112 of JS: TGP...


  In my own practice, I observed that when I used ++ and --, my code tended to be too tight, too tricky, too cryptic. So, as a matter of discipline, I don't use them any more. I think that as a result, my coding style has become cleaner.


That's all very lovely, but he doesn't give any examples of the way he codes them now. I assume he's doing something like...

var i;
i = 0;
i = i + 1;


Again, great, but I've got a few basic 'for loops' in my JS code, as I imagine many people have, and I've always used the standard syntax...

for (i = 0; i &lt; myArray.length; i++) { 
    // Loop Stuff 
}


Am I missing something? What's the cleanest and/or best way to increment/decrement?
","In C/C++ this is important, especially with arbitrary iterators and pre/post increment semantics. Also, random access vs forward-iterators.

In Javascript it's more about aesthetics than anything else. Unless you're dealing with strings. ""1""+1 is ""11"".

I would say that ++i is an idiom that's worth being consistent with.

",user3078439,https://mathoverflow.net/users/44691,"This answers @user3078439's question in his comment to my original answer.

First, a short argument to show that if $P,Q$ are domains and $f:P\to Q$ is Scott-continuous, then $f$ is order preserving.

Let $a\leq b \in P$. So $D:= \{a,b\}$ is a directed set with $b=\bigsqcup D$. Since $f$ is Scott-continuous, $f(D) = \{f(a), f(b)\}$ is also directed, so at least one of the relations $f(a) \leq f(b)$ or $f(b) \leq f(a)$ holds in $Q$. Now $f$ being Scott-continuous means $$f(b) = f(\bigsqcup D) = \bigsqcup f(D) = \sup\{f(a), f(b)\},$$ which directly implies $f(a)\leq f(b)$. So if $f:P\to Q$ is Scott-continuous, then it is order-preserving. (The converse of this statement does not hold.)

Since in your question the ordering on $Q:= \mathbb{IR}$ is given by $\supseteq$, I hope that I have answered your implicit question ""if $f$ being Scott-continuous truly means that for all $x\leq y, f(x)\supseteq f(y)$"" in the positive.

As to the question whether $f(-a)\supseteq f([-a,a])$ there is a negative answer: $f(-a)$ is just a real interval, namely $[f^-(-a), f^+(-a)]$. But $f([-a,a])$ is a set of intervals.

What is true, though, is that $f(-a)=[f^-(-a), f^+(-a)]$ is an interval that is a superset of every interval $f(x)=[f^-(x), f^+(x)]$ for all $x\in[-a,a]$. If that was the intent of your question in the comment, then there is a positive answer.

5463,5463,8673,probability of a certain event in a repeated sampling with replacement (without ordering),"I have a problem that is bugging me for a couple of weeks now. I have asked some friends etc but the answers were not satisfying at all.
So here we go.

Suppose we have a set S = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10} and each time we pick a random number from this set. After $N$ pickups suppose that the number, lets say 6, has never been picked. 
The question is, what is the probability of picking number 6 in the $N + 1$ pickup knowing that it has not been picked for the previous $N$ pickups?

I know that people will rush and say, its just $\frac 1 {10}$ but if we consider the previous pickups, meaning that we have a ""memory"" in the ""system"" doesn't it change everything? 

Imagine a representation of the distribution of # of picks on X axis and # of actually possible values to be picked in Y axis. Law of Large Numbers says that approximately every possible value will have the same number of pickups after a very large number of repetitive samplings N. Supposing that we have rolled for a large number of, lets say dice, and we see that a specific number has not been rolled yet, lets say the 6. Doesn't this implies that it is almost certain that the roll 6 has to come, it was just too unlikely to not have been rolled up to now, given that the dice is ""fair""?

I tried to solve this as binomial with Conditional Probability but i think its wrong cause the set is dynamic while Conditional Probability needs a constant set.
My wrong answer is here:

$N$ is known

Number $k$ $\in$ $S$ has $P_k$ = $\frac 1 {10}$ and $Q_k$ = $\frac 9 {10}$

In $N$ pickups no success:  $A$

In $N + 1$ pickups $1$ success: $B$

Binomial:

$p ( X=0)=$ $\binom{N}{0} P^0 Q^N =(\frac {9} {10})^N$

$p ( X=1)=$ $\binom{N+1}{1} P^1 Q^{N} ={\frac {(N+1)!} {N!}} (\frac {1} {10})(\frac {9} {10})^{N}=(N+1)(\frac {1} {10})(\frac {9} {10})^{N}$

And so we ask for the probability of B, given that A has been fulfilled:

$p(B/A) = \frac {P(B\bigcap A)} {P(A)} = \frac {\frac {1} {10}} {(\frac {9}{10})^N} =(\frac {10}{9})^N (\frac {1}{9})$

This seems to be wrong since $p &gt; 1$ for large N.

You can still calculate it as a conditional probability, of course, but you've miscalculated your $P(B\cap A),$ which is why you get a ""probability"" greater than $1$ eventually. Note that $B\cap A$ is the event in which $6$ is not chosen in the first $N$ picks, but is chosen once in $N+1$ picks (so necessarily on pick $N+1$). Equivalently, $B\cap A$ is the event of choosing $6$ for the first time on pick $N+1$. Part of the issue is that your $A$ and $B$ are not independent, so that makes calculation more cumbersome. Instead, let $C$ be the event of choosing $6$ on pick $N+1,$ and note that $C\cap A=B\cap A,$ and that the events $A,C$ (""never having chosen $6$ before"" and ""choosing $6$ now"") are independent. Thus, $$p(B\cap A)=p(C\cap A)=p(C)p(A)=\frac1{10}\cdot\left(\frac9{10}\right)^N.$$ Put another way: 


In $\left(\frac9{10}\right)^N$ of our possible outcomes, we have not chosen $6$ in the first $N$ picks.
In $\frac1{10}$ of those outcomes, we'll choose $6$ at pick $N+1$--specifically, when we choose $6$ next, rather than some other number.
$\frac1{10}$ of $\left(\frac9{10}\right)^N$ is $\frac1{10}\cdot\left(\frac9{10}\right)^N,$ the fraction of our possible outcomes in which we choose $6$ for the first time at pick $N+1$.


Thus, the probability is $$p(B\mid A)=\frac{p(B\cap A)}{p(A)}=\cfrac{\frac1{10}\cdot\left(\frac9{10}\right)^N}{\left(\frac9{10}\right)^N}=\frac1{10}.$$



Suppose we approach it combinatorically, instead?

There are $10^{N+1}$ total ways to make a sequence of $N+1$ picks from $S,$ but we already know that $6$ was not chosen in the first $N$ picks, so our sample space is narrowed (perhaps substantially, depending on how large $N$ is).

There are $9^N$ possible ways to make a sequence of $N$ choices from $S$ without choosing $6$. From this, it follows that:


There are $9^N\cdot 10$ possible ways to make a sequence of $N+1$ choices from $S$ without choosing $6$ except possibly at pick $N+1$. (This is the cardinality of our ""narrowed"" sample space.)
There are $9^N$ possible ways to make a sequence of $N+1$ choices from $S$ where $6$ is chosen for the first time at pick $N+1$. (This is the cardinality of the event we're interested in.)


Hence, the probability that we choose a $6$ on pick $N+1$, given that we haven't chosen $6$ in any of the previous $N$ picks, is $$\frac{9^N}{9^N\cdot 10}=\frac1{10}.$$

ListDensityPlot is a good candidate, but it seems to have strange performance issues.
I created a small test that plots 40000 points. It has three cases: using 2D array as input, using array of 3D points with integer coordinates $(x,y)$ and using array of 3D points with float coordinates $(x,y)$.

    TestFunction[x_, y_] := Sin[Pi/20* Sqrt[x^2 + y^2]];

It gives pretty strange result. When I simply scale axes and my coordinates are not integer anymore (the case is called ""Float""). The performance drops almost 10 times (3 seconds vs 25 seconds).

3159,3159,5030,How do I opt-out of the Social Security system?,"How do I opt-out of the Social Security system and give up my Social Security Number? If I do this, am I then exempt from paying Social Security income tax?
",Jesse,https://money.stackexchange.com/users/9631,"To give up your Social Security number, you would probably have to renounce your citizenship, since merely leaving the United States, becoming a permanent expatriate, etc. wouldn't be enough. 

Paying Social Security taxes is mandatory, however. Even if your income exceeds the means testing limits, you are still required to pay Social security (FICA) taxes on the income that falls beneath it. 

That being said, there are several groups that are exempt from paying Social Security taxes, based on what I can scrounge up through online searching. 


College students who work under the Federal Work Study program. 1
State or local government workers (like teachers, city workers, police, firefighters, etc.) hired before March 31, 1986 and who participate in their employers' alternative retirement systems. 
Self-employed workers with with yearly net earnings less than $400
Ministers, members of certain religious orders, and Christian Science practitioners may file IRS Form 4361 to exempt themselves from self-employment taxes, including FICA taxes. The picture is more complicated than this, however (see below).
All members of certain religious groups, like the Amish, Mennonites, etc. 2
Election workers earning $1,000 or less a year.
Minor children with earnings from household work but for whom household work is not their principal occupation.


If you aren't part of one of these groups or you joined them after already being enrolled in the Social Security system (i.e. paid FICA taxes, etc.), you don't have to take Social Security payments, but you are not exempt from FICA payroll taxes. This means that you can't simply become Amish and be exempt if you've already paid into the system.

Many of these answers were listed here, but the only stated source is ""Wikipedia,"" so take it with a grain of salt. I've tried to provide other sources where I could. 

Ministers/religious officials

I mentioned that the situation with ministers and/or religious officials is more complicated. Among other things, these officials need to certify that they are religiously opposed to receiving public insurance benefits and they have to file by a certain deadline soon after earning a certain amount as a minister. Furthermore, if you file this exemption and choose/chose to revoke it later on, e.g. by filing IRS Form 2031, during the short time windows when this is possible, you're no longer eligible to file for another exemption. Once you revoke your exemption, you won't get another one. 

Also note that this opt-out only applies to income earned as part of your ministry. For non-ministerial income, you're still required to pay FICA taxes even if you follow the procedure(s) above.

If you do opt-out

Clearly, opting out of the Social Security isn't easy, or even feasible, for many people, but if you are outside the system, common sense dictates that you should insure yourself against risks that would usually be covered, at least in part, by Social Security. Dave Ramsey maintains a list of such investments that he recommends ministers and religious officials who opt out of the Social Security system should purchase, but the rationale applies to anyone who isn't part of the system. 


Term life insurance that covers 10x your annual income. Normally, your spouse or dependents will receive a Social Security death benefit upon your death, but if you opt-out, your family doesn't have this option. Since the death benefit is a pittance ($255), however, you may want life insurance regardless of your participation in Social Security.
Long-term disability insurance. If you become disabled, you won't receive disability benefits, so you'll may want insurance to cover this risk.
Long-term care insurance. Similar to disability insurance, you may want additional income to cover you in case you require long-term care, and Medicaid isn't enough.
Other retirement savings. If you're not going to be paying money into Social Security, it makes sense to invest that money in some form of tax-advantaged or tax-sheltered retirement account to ensure that you still have some income in retirement. You won't be receiving Social Security checks, but you'll still need income.


Depending on your circumstances, it's may be a good idea to invest in some or all of these instruments anyway (especially tax-advantaged/tax-sheltered retirement accounts), because Social Security doesn't cover 100% of the risks you'll face, but that decision is highly specific to each person/family.

RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} !^http://www.domain.it$      [NC]

Do you know how could I fix this in .htaccess???

Then if somepage.htm has relative paths to the image like &lt;img src=""images/a.jpg""&gt; and you go to http://example.com/somepage.htm/, then your web browser will think it's in the ""somepage.htm"" directory and try to load the image http://example.com/somepage.htm/images/a.jpg.  Apache will probably send you another copy of somepage.htm if you go there, which will cause your browser to show a broken image.

I'm not sure if Apache has a setting to turn this off.   It doesn't make much sense on plain HTML files but the reason Apache (and other servers) allow this is for sites that use ""pretty URLs"" (like serverfault's URLs!) where the URL extends past the actual file.

In order to make hotlink protection work, in my Apache .htaccess I simply use this:

#Hotlink protection (only for www.domain.it cause http://domain.it is being redirected)
RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} !^http://www.domain.it/.*$      [NC]
RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} !^http://www.domain.it$      [NC]
RewriteRule .*\.(wav|swf|jpg|jpeg|gif|png|bmp|js)$ - [F,NC]


This works well, but I recently dicovered that when I ask for http://www.domain.com/somepage.htm/ (with final slash) the hotlink protection seems to be triggered and server stops page to download .(wav|swf|jpg|jpeg|gif|png|bmp|js) files

Do you know how could I fix this in .htaccess???

Before today I even thought that the server should return an error if I enter as URL http://www.domain.com/somepage.htm/ (with final slash). But I saw it's normal because if you look for http://www.php.net/docs.php it returns the same page of http://www.php.net/docs.php/ (final slash).
Why is that, could you explain me a bit?!

Thanks
","Are you sure it's the hotlink protection?  If your website is laid out something like this:

/somepage.htm
/images/a.jpg


Then if somepage.htm has relative paths to the image like &lt;img src=""images/a.jpg""&gt; and you go to http://example.com/somepage.htm/, then your web browser will think it's in the ""somepage.htm"" directory and try to load the image http://example.com/somepage.htm/images/a.jpg.  Apache will probably send you another copy of somepage.htm if you go there, which will cause your browser to show a broken image.

I'm not sure if Apache has a setting to turn this off.   It doesn't make much sense on plain HTML files but the reason Apache (and other servers) allow this is for sites that use ""pretty URLs"" (like serverfault's URLs!) where the URL extends past the actual file.  There isn't a file on serverfault called ""urls-with-final-slash-trigger-hotlink-protection-on-my-server"", that's just there for people (and Google) to read. You can load this question just fine with http://serverfault.com/questions/197935

While I don't know how serverfault was made (there are many ways to do this) it's almost certain that there's no file named ""197935"" either.  It's possible that there's a script named ""questions"" though, and the server could run that script, and the script would see the entire URL, look up the number in the database, and make this page.

",Matt,https://salesforce.stackexchange.com/users/17088,"Most likely the cause is either


You have a second trigger somewhere else in your code base on
Handoff__c that in turn does a DML update on itself  or
You have a field update on Handoff__c via a workflow that will cause the after update trigger to be reinvoked. 


You can resolve either of these by using the controlling recursive triggers recipe as shown in the SFDC doc here or here in Help doc. You may also be able to control it by tighter if statements to avoid creating the Events even if invoked twice.

","Most likely the cause is either


You have a second trigger somewhere else in your code base on
Handoff__c that in turn does a DML update on itself  or
You have a field update on Handoff__c via a workflow that will cause the after update trigger to be reinvoked. 


You can resolve either of these by using the controlling recursive triggers recipe as shown in the SFDC doc here or here in Help doc. You may also be able to control it by tighter if statements to avoid creating the Events even if invoked twice.

3789,3789,6024,What does a singular simplex with real coefficient mean ,"For an $n$-dimensional orientable closed manifold $M$, the simplicial volume is the infimum of the $l^1$-norm of the elements $\sum a_i \sigma_i$ ($a_i \in \mathbb{R}$) which represent the fundamental class.

",jiangsaiyin,https://mathoverflow.net/users/24637,"As Lee suggests, you should look at Allen Hatcher's book.  In particular, chapter 2 and section 3.3.

In practice, you can often think of $\sum a_{i}\sigma_{i}$ as coming from the following procedure.  Let $\phi:X\rightarrow M$ be a degree $d$ map of $n$-manifolds.  Then any singular cocycle (with integer coefficients) $\alpha$ representing the fundamental class of $X$ will push forward to a singular cocycle $\phi_{\ast}\alpha$ representing $d$ times the fundamental class of $M$.  Thus, $\frac{1}{d}\phi_{\ast}\alpha$ will be a cocycle (with rational coefficients) representing the fundamental class of $M$.

The prototypical examples are as follows:

If $M$ is a torus, then there are covering maps $\phi: M\rightarrow M$ of arbitrarily high degree, hence $M$ has no simplicial volume.  (We can iterate the above procedure, starting with any cocycle $\alpha$ representing the fundamental class of $M$, getting representatives $\alpha,\frac{1}{d}\phi_{\ast}(\alpha),\frac{1}{d^{2}}\phi_{\ast}^{2}(\alpha),\ldots$ with volume going to $0$.)

On the other hand, if $M$ is a higher genus surface, then this strategy is obstructed by Euler characteristic.  Namely, if $\phi:Y\rightarrow M$ is a degree $d$ covering map, then $\chi(Y)=d\chi(X)$, so the genus of $Y$ grows linearly with $d$.  In fact, you can show that $X$ has nontrivial simplicial volume using hyperbolic geometry.

1315,1315,2079,Persistent Connection Attempts By Akamai Technologies,"I have seen this question asked in different places, but have never seen a satisfactory answer:

On different computer builds, ASUS/GIGABYTE/MSI, I constantly have outgoing connections to XXX-XXX-XXX.deploy.static.akamaitechnologies.com over HTTP Port 80, and if the connection attempts are denied, the network card (or at least internet connectivity) stops working... LAN connections still appear to work. The outgoing connections occur on every restart, and must be allowed for the network card to function properly. If the attempts are denied, the system must be restated so that the connections will be attempted again and can be allowed.

This post suggests narrowing down an offending application, but I don't see how akamai technologies can be so intertwined in so many systems, cut-off connectivity if not allowed, etc. Something about it feels like unauthorized (or at least unwanted) information transfer, at the very least a phone-home, but I have no Wirshark captures to confirm this :)

My primary guess after looking at all the symptoms: the connection attempt is trying to see if there is internet connectivity, and if the attempt fails Windows assumes there is none... But this sounds really, really dumb.

LAN connections still appear to work. The outgoing connections occur on every restart, and must be allowed for the network card to function properly. If the attempts are denied, the system must be restated so that the connections will be attempted again and can be allowed.

This post suggests narrowing down an offending application, but I don't see how akamai technologies can be so intertwined in so many systems, cut-off connectivity if not allowed, etc. Something about it feels like unauthorized (or at least unwanted) information transfer, at the very least a phone-home, but I have no Wirshark captures to confirm this :)

My primary guess after looking at all the symptoms: the connection attempt is trying to see if there is internet connectivity, and if the attempt fails Windows assumes there is none... But this sounds really, really dumb.

print ''.join( [node.data for node in memoryElem.childNodes] )

","Here's an lxml snippet that extracts an attribute as well as element text (your question was a little ambiguous about which one you needed, so I'm including both):

from lxml import etree
doc = etree.parse(filename)

memoryElem = doc.find('memory')
print memoryElem.text        # element text
print memoryElem.get('unit') # attribute


You asked (in a comment on Ali Afshar's answer) whether minidom is a good alternative.  Here's the equivalent code using minidom; judge for yourself which is nicer:

import xml.dom.minidom as minidom
doc = minidom.parse(filename)

memoryElem = doc.getElementsByTagName('memory')[0]
print ''.join( [node.data for node in memoryElem.childNodes] )
print memoryElem.getAttribute('unit')

3327,3327,5310,Covariance and Contravariance on the same type argument,"The C# spec states that an argument type cannot be both covariant and contravariant at the same time.

This is apparent when creating a covariant or contravariant interface you decorate your type parameters with ""out"" or ""in"" respectively.  There is not option that allows both at the same time (""outin"").

Is this limitation simply a language specific constraint or are there deeper, more fundamental reasons based in category theory that would make you not want your type to be both covariant and contravariant?

Edit:

My understanding was that arrays were actually both covariant and contravariant.

974,974,1543,Where can I eat dishes that feature in western countries' Chinese restaurants?,"... apart from western countries like the Australia or the USA themselves.

During my visit to Taiwan, I wasn't able to find the dishes I'd typically encounter in a Chinese restaurant in Australia or the United States, such as sweet and sour pork, honey chicken, Mongolian lamb/beef, and fried ice cream.

I have two main theories on why this is. One is that Chinese restaurant food is totally made up, and has no similarity with food anywhere in the world. In which case, I'd better give up trying to find the right location. This seems to be the case with fried ice cream, which Wikipedia suggests is an artificial modern invention.

The other is that maybe I visited the wrong location. China is a big place, after all. Perhaps visiting another area, such as Inner Mongolia, would find me what I'm looking for, with dishes either the same as, or the un-modified version of what is served in western countries' Chinese restaurants.

The Wikipedia article on Chinese restaurant mentions:


  There has additionally been a consequential component of Chinese
  emigration of illegal origin, most notably Fuzhou people from Fujian
  Province and Wenzhounese from Zhejiang Province in Mainland China,
  specifically destined to work in Chinese restaurants in New York City,
  beginning in the 1980s.


As Fujian province is right next to Taiwan, and has had a major influence on it, it seems plausible that if some of the ""Chinese restaurant"" dishes were coming from Fujian, I would have seen them in Taiwan, but I didn't.

Then only the write speed will start fluctuating and then go slow again. If this is the case here I would test on a different system to confirm the results and if there is no change - go for RMA.
However if it's performing as expected in safe mode for a long period of time, you should dig into Windows. It could be a driver, but it could also be a process. It could also be due to insufficient power, but that usually happens with external drives.

866,866,1374,Plotting two functions with dependent input function,"I have defined a function: 

myJ2[n_] := 1/n* Total[RandomVariate[NormalDistribution[0, 1], n]^2]


This is basically an approximation to the gaussian integral. I want to plot this and the error graph (difference between the approximation and the exact value) at the same time. Using a random variable makes this difficult. I tried this:

DiscretePlot[{myJ2[n], 1 - myJ2[n]}, {n, 1, 1000}, Filling -&gt; None, Joined -&gt; True]


However, this is not quite correct, since the myJ2 function is called twice and hence gives different values due to the randomness. I improved this by using:

DiscretePlot[{x, 1 - x} /. x -&gt; myJ2[n], {n, 1, 1000}, Filling -&gt; None, Joined -&gt; True, PlotStyle -&gt; {Red, Blue}]


This gives me the correct values but both in the same color. How can I get both the function and the error function displayed in two graphs or with two different colors?

It is worth knowing that arithmetic operations are Listable, so you can just write 1-data to get the second series. This is almost always the fastest (and most succinct code) to get things done, as it avoids all the loop, iterator and Map paraphernalia.

You also don't need to transpose anything. Notice I have used ListLinePlot instead of ListPlot, which removes the need to specify the Joined option.

  Some professors and other interviewers have asked me where else I have interviewed. Should I tell interviewers where else I've interviewed?


Yes, it is very likely in your best interests.  If you have other interviews at comparable schools, then you will benefit from saying so.  If you don't, then it's not so clear.  However, departments will assume your job search is not going well if you are reluctant to address the issue and they haven't heard impressive rumors about your interviews, so avoiding discussing interviews won't really help.  Instead of saying something awkward like ""I'd rather not talk about that"", it's better to be up front and optimistic.  ""This is my first interview"" is better than ""This is my only interview so far"".

Here are a few reasons why telling about other interviews can help your case:


As a general rule, people want something more if they know other people also want it.  Valuing a second opinion is rational behavior.
Even when it doesn't change the outcome, competition can speed things up.  If a search committee member is trying to make an offer and still needs some final committee or administrative approval, it's helpful to be able to say ""Let's move fast, since she is also interviewing at X, Y, and Z, and we'd like to make a good impression by coming up with the first offer.""  If it's too late for that, they can say ""She already has an offer from X, so we need to act before she decides.""


In principle, you could hurt your chances if you list a lot of schools typically considered much more desirable (which could make the school you are currently interviewing at feel they would just be wasting their time trying to compete).  However, in this case you are probably already in trouble, since the rumors of your busy interview schedule may already worry the search committee.  Instead of trying to cover things up, it's better to acknowledge that you have these other interviews.  If you are worried about this risk, you can address it by making your interest clear throughout the interview.

This works for us because our hibernate enabled application is the only thing that touched the database and so we can guarantee that b is null only when the part is null.  Although the null part suggestion and the use of the Integer wrapper type are great suggestions, due to lots of reasons I don't really have control over, setting the column to nullable works best for us.

So I am looking for workarounds for this problem.  I noticed making Part.b an Integer instead of an int seems to work, but for reasons I won't bore you with this is not a good option for us.  Thanks!
","I found another workaround and thought I'd share it.  Turns out that if you make the int column nullable then Hibernate doesn't throw the PropertyValueException.

@Column(nullable = true)
public int b;


This works for us because our hibernate enabled application is the only thing that touched the database and so we can guarantee that b is null only when the part is null.  Although the null part suggestion and the use of the Integer wrapper type are great suggestions, due to lots of reasons I don't really have control over, setting the column to nullable works best for us.  Thanks though and I hope this helps someone else.

2530,2530,4033,Can a single bad letter of recommendation ruin my chances of getting admitted to grad school?,"I am dealing with one very mercurial professor and I had a bit of an incident with him.

757,757,1198,Grinding sound during cold start?,"I have a 2009 Honda Accord.  Over the past several months, I've noticed a grinding sound immediately after cold-starting the engine.  It only lasts for a fraction of a second, doesn't continue once the engine is running, and doesn't happen if I shut the engine off and start it again a few minutes later.

A little background:

The car has 92,000 miles on it.  I've noticed that it burns oil pretty quickly, so I keep an eye on it and make sure to add more if needed.  Most recently, I got an oil change with a high mileage synthetic, but that has not solved the issue.

Does anyone know what this could be?  Is it a big deal?  I'm obviously worried about damaging the engine.  Is this a major thing?  Or is it something I can live with, provided I don't mind the frightening noise that occurs on startup.

my problem is when I call the new loadMoreListView (). execute (); .. on listView.setOnScrollListener there is an error.
my problem is adapter 
this is my code

","see i guess somewhere in your network call (Async task) your ""itemList"" get updated without notifying adapter. because you are adding item in ""doInBackGround"" which is on different thread.

I would suggest you to use these two library for making REST network call and json parsing .
this is efficient in terms of memory and performance.

",Steg Verner,https://stackoverflow.com/users/4360034,"There's an underused STL algorithm called remove_if that allows you to efficiently (O(n)) remove all elements matching a predicate from a container. It is most useful if you have a vector or deque, because they have an expensive (O(n)) erase operation for an element ""in the middle"". However, you need to be aware that remove_if doesn't actually erase any element, it only moves all elements that do not match the predicate to the front of the range you specified. The canonical way to do an ""erase_if"" is therefore (in this example, all odd integers will be erased):


std::vector ints = …;
ints.erase(std::remove_if(begin(ints), end(ints), [](int i) { return i%2 != 0; }), end(ints));


Explanation: remove_if moves all ints not matching the predicate (i.e. the even ints in this example) to the front and returns an iterator one past the last of these elements. Then, we actually erase all elements starting with this one to the end of the vector using the range overload of vector&lt;int&gt;::erase.

E.g., assume we have ints == {5,7,4,10,9,16,20,6}. remove_if will turn ints into {4,10,16,20,6,UNSPEC,UNSPEC,UNSPEC} where I used UNSPEC to denote any unspecified value, and it will also return an iterator pointing to the first UNSPEC element. Then, we erase all the elements with unspecified value and get {4,10,16,20,6}, the desired result.

UPDATE: With respect to the previous answer, I want to point out that remove_if is stable, i.e. it will not change the order of the remaining elements.

I think it's something like this:

&lt;?php foreach ($_productCollection as $_product): ?&gt;
    ....
   &lt;?php
   echo '&lt;a data-id=""' . $_product-&gt;getId() . '"" data-url=""' . $this-&gt;helper('catalog/image')-&gt;init($this-&gt;getProduct(), 'thumbnail', $image-&gt;getFile())-&gt;resize(157) . '"" class=""hoveroverimagethumb ' . $_product-&gt;getId() . '-' . $imgi . '"" href=""' . $_product-&gt;getProductUrl() . '"" title=""' . $this-&gt;stripTags($this-&gt;getImageLabel($_product, 'small_image'), null, true) .'""&gt;&lt;img width=""48"" height=""48"" src=""' . $this-&gt;helper('catalog/image')-&gt;init($this-&gt;getProduct(), 'thumbnail', $image-&gt;getFile())-&gt;resize(157) . '""/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;';
   ....
   ?&gt;
&lt;?php endforeach;?&gt;


You need to replace $this-&gt;getProduct() with $_product.

736,736,1169,Why don't banks give access to all your transaction activity?,"In the era of big data, I find it surprising that banks and credit card companies only offer access to a ridiculously small number of transactions - often only your last 180 days, if that. The longest I've seen was 720 days going back. I suspect they do store everything, but intentionally limit access.

These transactions are text only, take up extremely little space, and storing an individual's lifetime worth of transaction would take less than 10MB of data; about the storage required by two MP3 files, and about 250k records per person per lifetime, if we generously assume everyone makes 10 transactions a day. But I'd be happy with only the last 10 years of transactions, so about 1MB per customer. One of the largest banks, JP Morgan Chase, has ~70MM credit card customers. That means 70TB of data for 10 years of records - hardly impressive for a corporation of that size, with $17B of net income in 2013, when 1TB of cloud storage costs $10 retail per month.

By comparison, would you put up with Gmail or any online email provider keeping only the most recent 120 days worth of email? (And emails do take a lot more space than transactions, are far more numerous, and have to be instantly retrievable.)

Storage requirements for transaction activity are trivial in an era where we're throwing around petabytes and zetabytes.

Is there a sound reason for banks not offering access to all your transactions, other than legacy software on their side?

1041,1041,1637,Where can I eat dishes that feature in western countries' Chinese restaurants?,"... apart from western countries like the Australia or the USA themselves.

During my visit to Taiwan, I wasn't able to find the dishes I'd typically encounter in a Chinese restaurant in Australia or the United States, such as sweet and sour pork, honey chicken, Mongolian lamb/beef, and fried ice cream.

I have two main theories on why this is. One is that Chinese restaurant food is totally made up, and has no similarity with food anywhere in the world. In which case, I'd better give up trying to find the right location. This seems to be the case with fried ice cream, which Wikipedia suggests is an artificial modern invention.

The other is that maybe I visited the wrong location. China is a big place, after all. Perhaps visiting another area, such as Inner Mongolia, would find me what I'm looking for, with dishes either the same as, or the un-modified version of what is served in western countries' Chinese restaurants.

The Wikipedia article on Chinese restaurant mentions:


  There has additionally been a consequential component of Chinese
  emigration of illegal origin, most notably Fuzhou people from Fujian
  Province and Wenzhounese from Zhejiang Province in Mainland China,
  specifically destined to work in Chinese restaurants in New York City,
  beginning in the 1980s.


As Fujian province is right next to Taiwan, and has had a major influence on it, it seems plausible that if some of the ""Chinese restaurant"" dishes were coming from Fujian, I would have seen them in Taiwan, but I didn't.

Where, if anywhere, can I find the dishes that feature in western countries' Chinese restaurants? Also, how should I identify the right kind of eatery in those countries?

5605,5605,8893,Who should pursue a Ph.D degree?,"I am asking myself the question ""Should I do PhD or should I leave academia and go for an industrial career?""

My life-goal is being a professor. And I love to do research. 

PhD is surely a bite that not everyone can chew.
But I wonder who can chew it?

I never was good at tests and exams. My BSc. GPA was 2.84/4.00 but finished my MSc. with 3.50/4.00

However, currently I am working on a conference paper and I feel like even that is too much for me. It has been nearly 3 months and still, the paper draft is to be improved (not the wording but the content).

I am surely a hard-worker but not always. Sometimes, I let go of my work and absorbed in other stuff (composing, amateur radio etc). If this period is too wide, I have to spend double effort to warm-up and remember where I left.

I don't know how things work in PhD. It usually is 5-6 years. It is the one of two most-challenging milestones in academic career (the other is getting the title Assoc. Prof).
Should I completely be a ""nerd"" and work on my thesis systematically (something I could never make in my entire life) or working periodically but with extra effort is still sufficient?

So, here's my question: If I say ""I'm considering to do PhD"" and ask your advice, what would you ask me? What kind of skills/characteristics do you look for a potential academician?

I know it is way too late for me to ask this kind of question, as a person who almost finished his master's degree. But better lose the saddle than the horse. 
",padawan,https://academia.stackexchange.com/users/15949,"You sound a lot like me when I was thinking about doing a PhD, albeit you aim to be a professor, and while I like the idea I'm not so fussed about the administrative side of being in a university.

If you have a tendency to concentrate on whatever is the most interesting thing in front of you, then I would very strongly advise proceeding if and only if you find a good, hands-on supervisor. Ask their previous doctoral students how often they met with them in the first few years - some supervisors will see you once a month or so, others I have heard meet their students individually or collectively several times a week.

In the UK, PhDs are usually 3 years. And the rough schedule is that for the first year you look at one or more problems, trying to understand how you might make some progress. In the second year, you make some small advance on one project and try in vain to develop the project into a more concrete thesis. In the third year you accept that your small advance was all you are going to get, and write it up. The slow pace of progress in the second year commonly causes distress or apathy.

In order to complete such a project, you either need to be personally very disciplined or be part of a team (you, your supervisor, perhaps some peers) that can keep you honest - remember that rubber-ducking is a vital part of academic work; most academics in the UK will congregate in the department kitchen once or twice a day just to talk to other academics, because often just explaining yourself gets you closer to a solution. Similarly, you need people to ask you where you've got to so that you don't just disappear off for a month because you're faced with something annoying and your symphony suddenly seems fascinating.

I struggled with this; my supervisor was hands-off, my peers were in very different fields (I was a theorist among experimentalists for a start) and I didn't really understand my own character enough to see what was happening.

One of my peers had a supervisor who used to take students through rigorous textbooks, and expect them to grasp whole chapters to be quizzed on - the sound of it terrified me, but in retrospect the foundations are well worth laying. Instead I often disappeared down dead-ends because I was unaware of entire fields of research, and just didn't have the terminology or context to find them.

So, in sum, you have some well-placed concerns, but the answer is not just whether you are capable of a PhD but whether you are in the context of your supervisor, peers and department.

My life-goal is being a professor. And I love to do research. 

PhD is surely a bite that not everyone can chew.
But I wonder who can chew it?

I never was good at tests and exams. My BSc. GPA was 2.84/4.00 but finished my MSc. with 3.50/4.00

However, currently I am working on a conference paper and I feel like even that is too much for me. It has been nearly 3 months and still, the paper draft is to be improved (not the wording but the content).

I am surely a hard-worker but not always. Sometimes, I let go of my work and absorbed in other stuff (composing, amateur radio etc). If this period is too wide, I have to spend double effort to warm-up and remember where I left.

I don't know how things work in PhD. It usually is 5-6 years. It is the one of two most-challenging milestones in academic career (the other is getting the title Assoc. Prof).
Should I completely be a ""nerd"" and work on my thesis systematically (something I could never make in my entire life) or working periodically but with extra effort is still sufficient?

So, here's my question: If I say ""I'm considering to do PhD"" and ask your advice, what would you ask me? What kind of skills/characteristics do you look for a potential academician?

I know it is way too late for me to ask this kind of question, as a person who almost finished his master's degree. But better lose the saddle than the horse. 
","You sound a lot like me when I was thinking about doing a PhD, albeit you aim to be a professor, and while I like the idea I'm not so fussed about the administrative side of being in a university.

If you have a tendency to concentrate on whatever is the most interesting thing in front of you, then I would very strongly advise proceeding if and only if you find a good, hands-on supervisor. Ask their previous doctoral students how often they met with them in the first few years - some supervisors will see you once a month or so, others I have heard meet their students individually or collectively several times a week.

In the UK, PhDs are usually 3 years. And the rough schedule is that for the first year you look at one or more problems, trying to understand how you might make some progress. In the second year, you make some small advance on one project and try in vain to develop the project into a more concrete thesis. In the third year you accept that your small advance was all you are going to get, and write it up. The slow pace of progress in the second year commonly causes distress or apathy.

In order to complete such a project, you either need to be personally very disciplined or be part of a team (you, your supervisor, perhaps some peers) that can keep you honest - remember that rubber-ducking is a vital part of academic work; most academics in the UK will congregate in the department kitchen once or twice a day just to talk to other academics, because often just explaining yourself gets you closer to a solution.

5253,5253,8352,Dealing with digital circuits and their associated switching speed?,"When designing a digital one-minute counting circuit I came across a difficult problem. 

Basically, I designed the circuit to drive the (normally HIGH) clock of the 10s slot low if the 1s slot's current state was 9 (actually, just if the first and last bits are HIGH -> 1001)

The devices I am using are positive edge, so when the 1s slot returns to zero the condition is no longer satisfied - therefore the clock returns to a HIGH state and increments the 10s slot.

The problem is that I was getting double clock problems(7->8 transition and the designed clock mechanism).   

It turns out that there was just enough delay in the switching between 7 -> 8 (0111 -> 1000) that the first/last bit HIGH condition is satisfied:

i.e., some combination occurs in the transition period to register a logical HIGH at the output

1001 1011 1101 1111

The temporary solution to the problem I came up with was to actually keep the clock for the 10s slot LOW until the condition where the 1s slot equals 0 (0000) is satisfied(So, essentially clock WHEN we get to the state as opposed to before). However, this solution requires too many gates (a 4-input NOR minimum). My previous design was actually fed from another part in the design that is already present, so it didn't require any additional circuitry. 

Any ideas on a more efficient solution?  




The IC's used in this design are the 74LS47 (7Segment decoder) and the 74LS163 (4-bit binary counter). The pull-down resistor inclusion is a mechanism to set the counters to 00 and hold while the switch is closed.

3203,3203,5105,"Is it safe to disable cache flushing on a SSD with ""power loss protection""?","I have an Intel 320 SSD which is supposedly able to flush its cache during a power loss.

From Storage Review:


  Rarely seen in a consumer SSD, Intel uses an array of capacitors to
  make sure data gets saved to the drive in the event of an unsafe
  shutdown as the result of power loss.


From Intel:


  The Intel SSD 320 Series contains hardware- and firmware-based
  power-loss data protection features. The SSD includes a power-fail
  detection circuit, which  sends a signal to the ASIC controller in the
  SSD indicating there is an imminent drop in power level. Triggered
  by this, SSD firmware disconnects the input power from the SSD.
  
  The SSD then relies on its on-board power-loss protection capacitance
  to provide enough energy for  the SSD firmware to move data from the
  transfer buffer and other temporary buffers to the NAND.


Does it mean I can safely turn off ""Windows write-cache buffer flushing""? My primary motivation is to improve performance, although I'm aware that this might not make a big change for desktop workload.

I would draw your attention to the ext4 filesystem and the ""barrier"" option, which is enabled by default.  Barriers ensure the consistency of the FS on power-failure by enforcing ordering between certain writes.  At least when it was first implemented, this involved forcing a flush of the write cache on the hard drive.

Only if the system as a whole is protected by a trusted UPS (i.e. a battery), and you trust the OS not to crash, then I believe it is safe to disable barriers on Linux.  [I am not a professional.

As pointed out by Brian Hooper, these symmetries (when applied to physical laws) give rise to the conservations of linear and angular momentum as a result of Noether's theorem.

In addition, the cosmological principal is important for the physical interpretation of observational data, and not only because it is a generally unspoken assumption when using physical laws tested on Earth to model distant objects (galaxies, quasars, etc.) For example, it supports the interpretation of the Hubble diagram as the result of the expansion of the universe as opposed to evidence that the Earth (or someplace ""nearby"") was at the center of a very big conventional explosion. After all, in a conventional explosion, the fragments that travel the farthest are those that had the highest velocity, so some time after the explosion, faster moving fragments are further away from the center. If, however, observers on all fragments see the same density of galaxies and relationship between velocity and distance in all directions, then this model doesn't work.

If I just compile with just -static and without -optl-static

It seems that the version of libc that I'm compiling against is
different.  I tried also adding libc to the batch of libraries the
same way I did for libgmp but this results in a segmentation fault
when the application starts on the Heroku side.

Everything works fine on my PC.  I'm running 64bit archlinux with ghc
7.0.3.  The blog post on the official Yesod blog looked pretty easy
but I'm stumped at this point.  Anyone have any ideas?  If there's a way to get this thing working without building statically I'm open to that too.

EDIT

Per Employed Russians answer I did the following to fix this.

First created a new directory lib under the project directory and copied the missing shared libraries into it.  You can get this information by running ldd path/to/executable and heroku run ldd path/to/executable and comparing the output.

I then did heroku config:add LD_LIBRARY_PATH=./lib so when the application is started the dynamic linker will look for libraries in the new lib directory.

Finally I created an ubuntu 11.10 virtual machine and built and deployed to Heroku from there, this has an old enough glibc that it works on the Heroku host.

Edit:
I've since written a tutorial on the Yesod wiki
",asm,https://stackoverflow.com/users/166732,"I have no idea what Yesod is, but I know exactly what each of your other errors means.

First, you should not try to link statically. The warning you get is exactly right: if you link statically, and use one of the routines for which you are getting the warning, then you must arrange to run on a system with exactly the same version of libc.so.6 as the one you used at build time.

Contrary to popular belief, static linking produces less, not more, portable executables on Linux.

Your other (static) link errors are caused by missing libopenssl.a at link time.

But let's assume that you are going to go the ""sane"" route, and use dynamic linking.

For dynamic linking, Linux (and most other UNIXes) support backward compatibility: an old binary continues to work on newer systems. But they don't support forward compatibility (a binary built on a newer system will generally not run on an older one).

But that's what you are trying to do: you built on a system with glibc-2.14 (or newer), and you are running on a system with glibc-2.13 (or older).

The other thing you need to know is that glibc is composed of some 200+ binaries that must all match exactly. Two key binaries are /lib/ld-linux.so and /lib/libc.so.6 (but there are many more: libpthread.so.0, libnsl.so.1, etc. etc). If some of these binaries came from different versions of glibc, you usually get a crash. And that is exactly what you got, when you tried to place your glibc-2.14 libc.so.6 on the LD_LIBRARY_PATH -- it no longer matches the system /lib/ld-linux.

So what are the solutions? There are several possibilities (in increasing difficulty):


You could copy ld-2.14.so (the target of /lib/ld-linux symlink) to the target system, and invoke it explicitly:

/path/to/ld-2.14.so --library-path &lt;whatever&gt; /path/to/your/executable


This generally works, but can confuse an application that looks at argv[0], and breaks for applications that re-exec themselves.
You could build on an older system.
You could use appgcc (this option has disappeared, see this for description of what it used to be).
You could set up a chroot environment matching the target system, and build inside that chroot.
You could build yourself a Linux-to-olderLinux crosscompiler

",Bharat,https://stackoverflow.com/users/317512,"You have an off by one error indeed: the call

Your code passes j-1 which is the length from the beginning of the string to the position of the last space; it should be the length of the last word, so you need to subtract the index of the first character (i.e. i).

You are also not reversing the last word (see the other answer for the details on that).

UPDATE: Based on @Daniel Fischer's answer, here is the correct implementation : http://ideone.com/TYw1k
","You have an off by one error indeed: the call

reverse(st+i,j-1);


should be

reverse(st+i,j-i-1);


Your code passes j-1 which is the length from the beginning of the string to the position of the last space; it should be the length of the last word, so you need to subtract the index of the first character (i.e. i).

You are also not reversing the last word (see the other answer for the details on that).

3459,3459,5509,How can I tell when music is live and not recorded?,"I was walking past a bar the other day and heard music coming out. I could immediately tell that the music was live, being played in the bar at that moment. This is something I have often noticed, I can tell whether music is recorded or being played live. 

This seems to extend to recordings of live music as well. I have often found myself identifying that the musical background of, for example, a youtube video was being played at the time and was recorded using the same microphone that recorded the ambient sound of the video.

First of all, I assume that I am not alone and that any musician or music lover can also make this distinction. So, why can we do this? What is it that allows us to recognize live performances? I assume it has something to do with the way they are recorded (or not as the case may be) and that a good sound engineer would be able to fix things so that I couldn't tell but what does it depend on?
",terdon,https://music.stackexchange.com/users/9576,"Recorded music has the acoustics of two rooms.

\end{multline}

The function $\epsilon(k)$ is the dispersion of the particles (polaritons). The polaritons are a non-equilibrium system, due to their finite lifetime (damping rate $\gamma$). Therefore, they need continuous pumping with amplitude $F_p$ at energy $\omega_p$.
Finally, there exists a momentum-dependent nonlinear interaction $g_{k,q_1,q_2}$ that depends of the so-called Hopfield coefficients $X$ (simple functions of momentum) as:

As piece of general advice, the meaning of these terms are always clearly if integrate over the momentum coordinates of each of the fields, using delta functions to preserve the value. So the non-linear term would be

Maybe you can also see this way that the structure is determined by momentum conservation/translation invariance. Now when I integrate this by $\int\!dk\,e^{ikr}$, the $k$ integral is resolved trivially and I'm left with fourier transforms over the $q$s. Since Fourier transforms take multiplication to convolution, you can calculate that we get
$$\int dr_{123}\,\tilde{g}(r-r_1,r-r_2,r-r_3)\tilde{\psi}^*\!(r_1)\tilde{\psi}(r_2)\tilde{\psi}(r_3)$$

Which is more or less the most general third order nonlinear term you can write. In your case you can also reduce this further by using the real space transforms of $X$, either by plugging in directly to the first equation I wrote, or by calculating $\tilde{g}$ and plugging into the second.

Now when I integrate this by $\int\!dk\,e^{ikr}$, the $k$ integral is resolved trivially and I'm left with fourier transforms over the $q$s. Since Fourier transforms take multiplication to convolution, you can calculate that we get
$$\int dr_{123}\,\tilde{g}(r-r_1,r-r_2,r-r_3)\tilde{\psi}^*\!(r_1)\tilde{\psi}(r_2)\tilde{\psi}(r_3)$$

Which is more or less the most general third order nonlinear term you can write. In your case you can also reduce this further by using the real space transforms of $X$, either by plugging in directly to the first equation I wrote, or by calculating $\tilde{g}$ and plugging into the second.

If I just compile with just -static and without -optl-static
everything builds fine but the application crashes when it tries to
start on Heroku.

I tried adding libgmp.so.10 to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH as suggested in here

It seems that the version of libc that I'm compiling against is
different.  I tried also adding libc to the batch of libraries the
same way I did for libgmp but this results in a segmentation fault
when the application starts on the Heroku side.

Everything works fine on my PC.  I'm running 64bit archlinux with ghc
7.0.3.  The blog post on the official Yesod blog looked pretty easy
but I'm stumped at this point.  Anyone have any ideas?  If there's a way to get this thing working without building statically I'm open to that too.

EDIT

Per Employed Russians answer I did the following to fix this.

First created a new directory lib under the project directory and copied the missing shared libraries into it.  You can get this information by running ldd path/to/executable and heroku run ldd path/to/executable and comparing the output.

I then did heroku config:add LD_LIBRARY_PATH=./lib so when the application is started the dynamic linker will look for libraries in the new lib directory.

Finally I created an ubuntu 11.10 virtual machine and built and deployed to Heroku from there, this has an old enough glibc that it works on the Heroku host.

Edit:
I've since written a tutorial on the Yesod wiki

You should not build production binaries on bleeding edge distributions. The libraries on the production system will not be forward compatible.

You should not link glibc statically - it will always at runtime try to load additional libraries. For example cpu-based assembly. That is what your first warnings are about.

If I just compile with just -static and without -optl-static
everything builds fine but the application crashes when it tries to
start on Heroku.

I tried adding libgmp.so.10 to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH as suggested in here
and then got the following error:

2011-12-28T01:31:25+00:00 heroku[web.1]: Process exited


It seems that the version of libc that I'm compiling against is
different.  I tried also adding libc to the batch of libraries the
same way I did for libgmp but this results in a segmentation fault
when the application starts on the Heroku side.

Everything works fine on my PC.  I'm running 64bit archlinux with ghc
7.0.3.  The blog post on the official Yesod blog looked pretty easy
but I'm stumped at this point.  Anyone have any ideas?  If there's a way to get this thing working without building statically I'm open to that too.

EDIT

Per Employed Russians answer I did the following to fix this.

First created a new directory lib under the project directory and copied the missing shared libraries into it.  You can get this information by running ldd path/to/executable and heroku run ldd path/to/executable and comparing the output.

I then did heroku config:add LD_LIBRARY_PATH=./lib so when the application is started the dynamic linker will look for libraries in the new lib directory.

Finally I created an ubuntu 11.10 virtual machine and built and deployed to Heroku from there, this has an old enough glibc that it works on the Heroku host.

Edit:
I've since written a tutorial on the Yesod wiki
","You have several issues.

The key here is the ""some"".  The append after command needs a command to be appended after.  Things that work are node, edge, to, and likewise.  Your \path has no commands and so there is no chance of the append after command being executed.  What you want here is the insert path key which sticks in the path at that point.  Once you change that, then you get some output but you also find a few other (small) errors: you didn't name the nodes here and there, the fill=red command is a little odd, and the draw needs to be in brackets to be interpreted as a style.

","From the TikZ/PGF manual (emphasis added):


  Some of the path commands described in the following sections take optional arguments. For these
  commands, when you use this key inside these options, the path will be inserted after the path
  command is done.


The key here is the ""some"".  The append after command needs a command to be appended after.  Things that work are node, edge, to, and likewise.  Your \path has no commands and so there is no chance of the append after command being executed.  What you want here is the insert path key which sticks in the path at that point.  Once you change that, then you get some output but you also find a few other (small) errors: you didn't name the nodes here and there, the fill=red command is a little odd, and the draw needs to be in brackets to be interpreted as a style.

I would like to do so legally for my non-commercial release of a future mod. I am not sure what kind of conversion will remove any licensing data associated with my models (from 3dsMax) as I want it to be clean enough for public release from Blender.

Having made those disclaimers, it is my understanding that the producers or Vendors of a software program do not have any legal interest in any output file (in this case a mesh) that you produce with your software. Just as Micro$oft does not have any intellectual property rights in a novel you create with their word processing software, the purveyors of 3DS Mas probably do not have any intellectual property rights in your meshes. The only exception of which I am aware to this general principle is if the file format to which you are exporting is proprietary, in which case the file format might be copyright. But even then, while the file format might be subject to copyright, that copyright applies to the file format, not the file content.

Having made those disclaimers, it is my understanding that the producers or Vendors of a software program do not have any legal interest in any output file (in this case a mesh) that you produce with your software. Just as Micro$oft does not have any intellectual property rights in a novel you create with their word processing software, the purveyors of 3DS Mas probably do not have any intellectual property rights in your meshes. The only exception of which I am aware to this general principle is if the file format to which you are exporting is proprietary, in which case the file format might be copyright. But even then, while the file format might be subject to copyright, that copyright applies to the file format, not the file content.

However, the format to which you expect to export, ~.obj, is an open format, and is not controlled by the purveyors of 3DS Max, so there is unlikely to be any associated licensing data.

The issue i am having is that some customers continue to access the portal through the Customer Portal URL which causes issues with some VF pages and custom links once they are logged in.

My question, Is there anyway to prevent users from logging in using the Customer Portal Login URL and force them to use the Force.com Site login page?
",Steve__c,https://salesforce.stackexchange.com/users/3050,"Since you can't disable the customer portal login interface, one method that works well is to upload HTML to be used as the ""Login Message"". This HTML is pretty limited in what can be contained within it and the allowable markup. If you write the markup in the document and it's not rendered to the browser, it's not allowed. 

This basic solution provides an effective way to dissuade customers from using this login page any longer by making it more apparent that there is another mechanism which should be used and provide them great messaging about your new and improved Site interface.

The idea is that the HTML fragment has some great messaging and then a bunch of line breaks to push the login control well off the bottom of the visible area of the page so that the user doesn't see it immediately.

One manageable downside to this approach is that you will need to modify this document in each of your environments (sandbox, etc) so that the hyperlink to the Site is correct for that environment.

6009,6009,9530,Why don't banks give access to all your transaction activity?,"In the era of big data, I find it surprising that banks and credit card companies only offer access to a ridiculously small number of transactions - often only your last 180 days, if that. The longest I've seen was 720 days going back. I suspect they do store everything, but intentionally limit access.

These transactions are text only, take up extremely little space, and storing an individual's lifetime worth of transaction would take less than 10MB of data; about the storage required by two MP3 files, and about 250k records per person per lifetime, if we generously assume everyone makes 10 transactions a day. But I'd be happy with only the last 10 years of transactions, so about 1MB per customer. One of the largest banks, JP Morgan Chase, has ~70MM credit card customers. That means 70TB of data for 10 years of records - hardly impressive for a corporation of that size, with $17B of net income in 2013, when 1TB of cloud storage costs $10 retail per month.

By comparison, would you put up with Gmail or any online email provider keeping only the most recent 120 days worth of email? (And emails do take a lot more space than transactions, are far more numerous, and have to be instantly retrievable.)

   drupal_add_css(drupal_get_path('module', 'module_name') . '/css/css_file_name.css');

3) You can make use of syntax like this to set some settings variable &amp; check in your js file before invoking your event inside the behavior

These groups form unrelated problems. One way finding the answer is to see them as maximum flow problems where each index form two vertices.
Each index is connected to all the indexes following it and all the indexes preceding it are connected to it. The weight of the edges is the distance of the elements in the array, i.e. the difference between the two indexes. All the ""source"" vertices are connected to an infinite source and all the ""destination"" vertices are connected to a sink.
The sum of the values of the maximum flows for all the problems is the sum you are looking for.  

As an example, let's use the indexes for the item 0:

           +-------- 0 ----------+      0 --------+
           |                     |                |
           |                     |                |
Source ----+-------- 2 -------+  +----&gt; 2 --------+---- Sink
           |                  |  |                |
           |                  |  |                |
           +-------- 4 ----+  +--+----&gt; 4 --------+
           |               |  |  |                |

           +-------- 6     +--+--+----&gt; 6 --------+


Weight of arc (u, v) = v - u


Note that the number of edges grows as V^2 because every edge corresponds to a difference you have to do in order to compute the result, which are between each index and all its successors. This makes the complexity of the solution O(n^3) which is even worse than the naive algorithm, it's just a nice way of viewing things from another perspective :)

The weight of the edges is the distance of the elements in the array, i.e. the difference between the two indexes. All the ""source"" vertices are connected to an infinite source and all the ""destination"" vertices are connected to a sink.
The sum of the values of the maximum flows for all the problems is the sum you are looking for.  

As an example, let's use the indexes for the item 0:

           +-------- 0 ----------+      0 --------+
           |                     |                |
           |                     |                |
Source ----+-------- 2 -------+  +----&gt; 2 --------+---- Sink
           |                  |  |                |
           |                  |  |                |
           +-------- 4 ----+  +--+----&gt; 4 --------+
           |               |  |  |                |
           |               |  |  |                |
           +-------- 6     +--+--+----&gt; 6 --------+


Weight of arc (u, v) = v - u


Note that the number of edges grows as V^2 because every edge corresponds to a difference you have to do in order to compute the result, which are between each index and all its successors. This makes the complexity of the solution O(n^3) which is even worse than the naive algorithm, it's just a nice way of viewing things from another perspective :)

3990,3990,6368,How is the energy/eigenvalue gap plot drawn for adiabatic quantum computation?,"I was going through arXiv:quant-ph/0001106v1, the first paper by Farhi on adiabatic quantum computation.
 Equation 2.24 says, $$\tilde{H}(s) = (1-s)H_B + sH_P$$ which means the adiabatic evolution starts from the ground state of $H_B$ and slowly evolves until it arrives at the ground state of $H_P$. In section 3.1, the one qubit example has the adiabatic Hamiltonian as $$\tilde{H}(s) = \begin{pmatrix}
s &amp; \epsilon (1-s) \\ 
\epsilon (1-s) &amp; 1-s   
\end{pmatrix}$$
I don't see how the plot of Figure 1 is drawn. In figure 1, Farhi plotted eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian for s while the range for s was 0 to 1. The Hamiltonian is supposed to evolve according to the Schrodinger equation (eq 2.1), $$i \frac{d}{dt} |\Psi (t) \rangle = H(t) |\Psi (t) \rangle$$
Was this evolution solved to draw the plot? Or did Farhi derive the formula for eigenvalues in terms of s using just matrix math and plotted accordingly?
",Omar Shehab,https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/15688,"The latter. The reason is because it doesn't make a lot of sense to do the eigendecomposition of an approximated Hamiltonian, which is what you're doing when solving for the dynamics (your operator probably won't be Hermitian so your energies won't even be real). Doing the evolution gives you the final state probabilities, but it's not very good for analyzing the energy gap precisely.

So you just plug in the right $s$ values and find the eigenvalues of that $H(s)$, and plotting that gives you the eigenspectrum in Fig. 1.

However, currently I am working on a conference paper and I feel like even that is too much for me. It has been nearly 3 months and still, the paper draft is to be improved (not the wording but the content).

I am surely a hard-worker but not always. Sometimes, I let go of my work and absorbed in other stuff (composing, amateur radio etc). If this period is too wide, I have to spend double effort to warm-up and remember where I left.

  skills/characteristics do you look for a potential academician?


The first questions I would ask is: are you really interested in the subject? Can you imagine spending the next 5+ years thinking about pretty much nothing else?
Why do you want to do a PhD in the first place?


  However, currently I am working on a conference paper and I feel like
  even that is too much for me. It has been nearly 3 months and still,

  Sometimes, I let go of my  work and absorbed in other stuff.


This is also not very helpful for pursuing a PhD.

I think in most fields (that might be different for some fields of science) getting a PhD is only for people who want to do research. Apart from that it is only a waste of time and money. So the question you should ask yourself is not: Am I able to get a PhD? But rather: Do I want to get a PhD?

However, if you decided that you really want to give it a try: talk to someone from your university about it, maybe the supervisor of your thesis. Grades are not always a good indicator of the quality as a researcher.



EDIT:


  My life-goal is being a professor. And I love to do research.

So, I have tried to do this myself in my own app, however I cannot change neiher the color nor the blinking internal of the LED. I currently use this code:

public class MainActivity extends Activity {
  static final int NOTIFICATION_ID = 1;

  @Override
  public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    setContentView(R.layout.main);

    button.setOnClickListener(buttonOnClick);
  }

  public OnClickListener buttonOnClick = new OnClickListener() {

    @Override
    public void onClick(View v) {
      String ns = Context.NOTIFICATION_SERVICE;
      NotificationManager mNotificationManager = (NotificationManager) getSystemService(ns);

      Notification notification = new Notification(R.drawable.icon, ""Hello"", System.currentTimeMillis());
      notification.flags = Notification.FLAG_SHOW_LIGHTS | Notification.FLAG_AUTO_CANCEL;
      notification.ledARGB = Color.BLUE;
      notification.ledOnMS = 1000;
      notification.ledOffMS = 300;

      notification.setLatestEventInfo(context, contentTitle, contentText, contentIntent);

      mNotificationManager.notify(NOTIFICATION_ID, notification);
    }
  };
}


But as I said, it doesn't work the way I want it to; instead it just blinks in regular green with the default delay, and not the one I have set in my code.

So, I have tried to do this myself in my own app, however I cannot change neiher the color nor the blinking internal of the LED. I currently use this code:

public class MainActivity extends Activity {
  static final int NOTIFICATION_ID = 1;

  @Override
  public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    setContentView(R.layout.main);

    Button button = (Button) findViewById(R.id.button);
    button.setOnClickListener(buttonOnClick);
  }

  public OnClickListener buttonOnClick = new OnClickListener() {

    @Override
    public void onClick(View v) {
      String ns = Context.NOTIFICATION_SERVICE;
      NotificationManager mNotificationManager = (NotificationManager) getSystemService(ns);

      Notification notification = new Notification(R.drawable.icon, ""Hello"", System.currentTimeMillis());
      notification.flags = Notification.FLAG_SHOW_LIGHTS | Notification.FLAG_AUTO_CANCEL;
      notification.ledARGB = Color.BLUE;
      notification.ledOnMS = 1000;
      notification.ledOffMS = 300;

      Context context = getApplicationContext();
      CharSequence contentTitle = ""My notification"";
      CharSequence contentText = ""Hello World!"";
      Intent notificationIntent = new Intent(MainActivity.this, MainActivity.class);
      PendingIntent contentIntent = PendingIntent.getActivity(MainActivity.this, 0, notificationIntent, 0);

      notification.setLatestEventInfo(context, contentTitle, contentText, contentIntent);

      mNotificationManager.notify(NOTIFICATION_ID, notification);
    }
  };
}


But as I said, it doesn't work the way I want it to; instead it just blinks in regular green with the default delay, and not the one I have set in my code.

Can anyone see what is wrong with my code, or know if I have to do something else to achieve this?

I am finishing up my master's in mathematical finance and now plan to pursue a PhD with my dissertation being in stochastic analysis/calculus, a branch of mathematics used in finance and physics.

My background on stochastic analysis:

I have had 3 classes related to stochastic analysis and 2 classes applying the concepts.

My thesis, being on the P-side of mathematical finance, has extremely little relevance to stochastic analysis, which is more used in the Q-side of mathematical finance.

The ONLY time stochastic analysis ever came up was encountering something in a paper that gives probabilities in the Q-side, and I thought of using a theorem to convert them to the P-side but later found out the paper was unnecessary or inapplicable (I forgot; I think I figured out another solution).

One problem I seem to have:

Some PhD applications seem to require a PhD proposal including a hypothesis, literature review and methodology.

I am not quite sure how mathematical research is conducted. Most of my research has been mainly in finance and statistics. What might I be able to do about this?

5777,5777,9154,Does Jesus eat food in heaven?,"Jesus said there will be no marriage in heaven, but after He rose He ate food. Does Jesus eat food in heaven? Is there any reason for us to suppose He does not?

This is the kind of question kids ask me in Sunday School.
",Mike,https://christianity.stackexchange.com/users/1743,"I must admit, I chuckled at This is the kind of question kids ask me in Sunday School.. Anyway...

First off, Revelations 19 has a wedding feast.


  Revelation 19:9 (NIV)
  9&nbsp;Then the angel said to me,   “Write this:   Blessed are those who are invited to the wedding supper of the Lamb!”   And he added, “These are the true words of God.” 


(Emphasis mine.)

You can't really have a feast without food or drink. There is also the promise of Jesus that He will not drink wine again until this very same feast.


  Matthew 26:29 (NLT)   
  
  29&nbsp;Mark my words—I will not drink wine again until the day I drink it new with you in my Father’s Kingdom.”
  
  Mark 14:25 (NLT)   
  
  25&nbsp;I tell you the truth, I will not drink wine again until the day I drink it new in the Kingdom of God.”
  
  Luke 22:18 (NLT)   
  
  18&nbsp;For I will not drink wine again until the Kingdom of God has come.”


This statement takes place immediately after Jesus offers wine and bread at the first Communion. Now, if there weren't any grapes in Heaven, could there be wine? Now, obviously, God could very easily simply produce wine on the spot, and a miracle should never be excluded from the set of possibilities.

Now to actually answer your real question: we can't really know. I know of no verse that talks about whether or not there is any food or drink being consumed in Heaven right now.

Does Jesus eat in heaven? What reason do we think he didn't?","I must admit, I chuckled at This is the kind of question kids ask me in Sunday School.. Anyway...

First off, Revelations 19 has a wedding feast.


  Revelation 19:9 (NIV)
  9&nbsp;Then the angel said to me,   “Write this:   Blessed are those who are invited to the wedding supper of the Lamb!”   And he added, “These are the true words of God.” 


(Emphasis mine.)

You can't really have a feast without food or drink. There is also the promise of Jesus that He will not drink wine again until this very same feast.


  Matthew 26:29 (NLT)   
  
  29&nbsp;Mark my words—I will not drink wine again until the day I drink it new with you in my Father’s Kingdom.”
  
  Mark 14:25 (NLT)   
  
  25&nbsp;I tell you the truth, I will not drink wine again until the day I drink it new in the Kingdom of God.”
  
  Luke 22:18 (NLT)   
  
  18&nbsp;For I will not drink wine again until the Kingdom of God has come.”


This statement takes place immediately after Jesus offers wine and bread at the first Communion. Now, if there weren't any grapes in Heaven, could there be wine? Now, obviously, God could very easily simply produce wine on the spot, and a miracle should never be excluded from the set of possibilities.

Now to actually answer your real question: we can't really know. I know of no verse that talks about whether or not there is any food or drink being consumed in Heaven right now. That said, what is there to keep Jesus and other people already up there from enjoying the gift of eating that God gave them? I mean...I could totally imagine Jesus munching on some fish with Peter, James, and John right now...

1299,1299,2046,How to set precision and format labeled Slider in Manipulate?,"For my calculations, I need increased precision of parameter 'k' in my Manipulate:

  SetPrecision[0.100, 22], Appearance -&gt; ""Labeled""}]


However, at the same time, for aesthetic reasons, I want the label to the right of the slider to display only couple of digits.

How this could be done?
",Cendo,https://mathematica.stackexchange.com/users/1290,"Two, now three, ways:  I think I'd recommend the first -- strike that -- maybe the third one at the end, but perhaps you have a reason for using SetPrecision, in which case, use the second.

This first one works as is.  One caveat: if the label is used as an input field, the number k will be set to a machine-precision number.

Manipulate[
 Plot[Cos[k x], {x, 0, 2 Pi}],
 {{k, 1}, 0.`22, 4.`22, 0.1`22, Appearance -&gt; ""Labeled""}]


The second way is to make your own label.  Here editing the label still maintains the desired precision.

Manipulate[
 Plot[Cos[k x], {x, 0, 2 Pi}],
 {{k, 1}, SetPrecision[0., 22], SetPrecision[4.0, 22], SetPrecision[0.100, 22],

      Appearance -&gt; ""Frameless"", BaseStyle -&gt; ""Label""]}] &amp;}
 ]


Here is a variation with a non-editable label:

Manipulate[
 Plot[Cos[k x], {x, 0, 2 Pi}],
 {{k, 1}, SetPrecision[0., 22], SetPrecision[4.0, 22], SetPrecision[0.100, 22],
  Row[{Manipulator[##], ""  "", Dynamic@Round[k, 0.1]}] &amp;}]


Both look the same.





There is a difference between setting the precision with SetPrecision and with a backtick:

x = SetPrecision[0.1, 22]
(* 0.1000000000000000055511 *)

y = 0.1`22
(* 0.1000000000000000000000 *)

Precision /@ {x, y}
(* {22., 22.} *)

x - y
(* 5.5511*10^-18 *)




Alternatively, you can use a dummy variable and convert it to the desired precision:

Manipulate[
 k = N[Round[k0, 1/10], 22];
 Plot[Cos[k x], {x, 0, 2 Pi}, PlotLabel -&gt; k],

289,289,466,Update UIProgressView on UITableViewCell,"At the moment I got my main tableview with cells, which are loaded from a XML and filled up. After that I can click on one cell and a detailview is loaded(xib file, loaded through code in the main tableview). On the detailview I can click a download button and some files are downloaded asynchron to the documents folder. Then I pop the view down and I see again my tableview.

My idea now is to see the progress of the download in the tableview cell. I set up a uiprogressview on every cell, which is hidden on default. I now want to see the progress bar when I start the download. How can I do that? 

I tried something with performSelectorOnMainThread and a selector, which change the progress of my selected cell(which I assign in the main tableview). Seems to be a bad idea - didnt work.

Some ideas how to do that?



EDIT2: Some piece of code of my solution, ATTENTION! This is not the real code, I deleted a lot of lines for inserting here. There arent all releases etc. I think the solution is really dirty, but I didnt found a better solution for me...

Some important things:


cellDownloading: Array which knows
every cell which is downloading at
the moment
progressDictionary: Knows the progress of every cell
cellDictionary: Knows every cell, filled up in the cellsForRowAtIndexpath delegte of the tableview


I also cant copy the whole code, because there is a lot which have nothing to do with the whole process, but I give you the important steps.
My cells are created through parsing a xml, so every cell has got a setId in my case.

//////////////////
// Downloader.mm
//////////////////

method to download asynchron

-(void)startAsynchronousDownload:(NSString*)path{    

// generate notification
NSMutableDictionary *userInfo = [[NSMutableDictionary alloc] init];
NSNumber *tmpSetId = [NSNumber numberWithInteger:setId];

[userInfo setObject:tmpSetId forKey:@""setId""];

NSNotification* notification = [NSNotification notificationWithName:@""downloadStackNotification"" object:self userInfo:userInfo];  
[[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] postNotification:notification];  

// add some infos...
NSMutableDictionary *dictionary = [[NSMutableDictionary alloc] init];
[dictionary setObject:tmpSetId forKey:@""setId""];
// perhaps more here

// asynchronous download handling
NSOperationQueue *queue = [NSOperationQueue alloc] init];
NSInvocationOperation *operation = [[NSInvocationOperation alloc] initWithTarget:self selector:@selector(downloadImagesWithDictionary:) object:dictionary];

// release
[operation release];
[dictionary release];
[userInfo release];
}


In my example the selector downloadImagesWithDictionary downloads some images, for every downloaded image I send a notification. Every stack of images have a setId in my case.

[...]
    NSMutableDictionary *userInfo = [[NSMutableDictionary alloc] init];
    NSNumber *sliceCounter = [NSNumber numberWithInt:i];
    NSNumber *amount = [NSNumber numberWithInt:amountOfImages];
    NSNumber *tmpSetId = [NSNumber numberWithInteger:setId];

    [userInfo setObject:sliceCounter forKey:@""actualImage""];
    [userInfo setObject:amount forKey:@""allImages""];
    [userInfo setObject:tmpSetId forKey:@""setId""];
    NSNotification* notification = [NSNotification notificationWithName:@""downloadSliceNotification"" object:self userInfo:userInfo];  
    [[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] postNotification:notification ];  
[...]


////////////////////////////
// TableViewController.mm
////////////////////////////

Now we need to get the notifications to update our tableview

[[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] addObserver:self selector:@selector(downloadSliceNotification:) name:@""downloadSliceNotification"" object:nil];
[[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] addObserver:self selector:@selector(downloadStackNotification:) name:@""downloadStackNotification"" object:nil];


We need a cell dictionary to know all indexpath of our existing tableview cells.
Fill them in the cellForRowAtIndexPath delegate

[cellDictionary setObject:indexPath forKey:[NSString stringWithFormat:@""%d"",cellSetId]];


Now we create the handler to do somehting if we got a notification
First the handler if the download starts
I have got a progress dictionary which knows every progress of every cell
I can identify every cell by the setId - perhaps u have to change that a little bit

- (void)downloadStackNotification:(NSNotification*)notification {  
NSDictionary *userInfo = [notification userInfo];
NSNumber *setId = [userInfo objectForKey:@""setId""];

NSNumber *progress = [NSNumber numberWithInt:0];    
[progressDictionary setObject:progress forKey:[setId stringValue]];

// add cell to downloadlist
[cellDownloading addObject:[setId stringValue]];


} 

Now for every download step(in my case one image). 
Calculate process and update the dictionary, get the cell to update the progress

- (void)downloadSliceNotification:(NSNotification*)notification {  
NSDictionary *userInfo = [notification userInfo];
NSNumber *sliceCounter = [userInfo objectForKey:@""actualImage""];
NSNumber *amount = [userInfo objectForKey:@""allImages""]; 
NSNumber *setId = [userInfo objectForKey:@""setId""]; 

NSNumber *progress = [NSNumber numberWithFloat:(100/[amount floatValue])*[sliceCounter floatValue]];      

[progressDictionary setObject:progress forKey:[setId stringValue]];
NSIndexPath* indexPath = [cellDictionary objectForKey:[setId stringValue]];

CustomServerCell* cell = (CustomServerCell*)[self.tableView cellForRowAtIndexPath:indexPath];
NSMutableDictionary *downloadData = [[NSMutableDictionary alloc] init];
[downloadData setObject:cell forKey:@""cell""];
[downloadData setObject:sliceCounter forKey:@""actualImage""];
[downloadData setObject:amount forKey:@""allImages""];

[self performSelectorOnMainThread:@selector(updateProgressWithDictionary:) withObject:downloadData waitUntilDone:NO];
} 


Update the cell

-(void)updateProgressWithDictionary:(NSMutableDictionary*)downloadData {

CustomServerCell* cell = (CustomServerCell*)[downloadData objectForKey:@""cell""];
NSNumber *sliceCounter = [downloadData objectForKey:@""actualImage""];
NSNumber *amount = [downloadData objectForKey:@""allImages""];

cell.progressView.hidden = FALSE;
NSNumber *tmpProgress = [progressDictionary objectForKey:[NSString stringWithFormat:@""%d"",cell.progressView.tag]];
cell.progressView.progress = [tmpProgress floatValue]/100;
cell.statusLabel.text = [NSString stringWithFormat:@""download slice %d / %d"",[sliceCounter integerValue],[amount integerValue]];


}

On the detailview I can click a download button and some files are downloaded asynchron to the documents folder. Then I pop the view down and I see again my tableview.

My idea now is to see the progress of the download in the tableview cell. I set up a uiprogressview on every cell, which is hidden on default. I now want to see the progress bar when I start the download. How can I do that? 

I tried something with performSelectorOnMainThread and a selector, which change the progress of my selected cell(which I assign in the main tableview). Seems to be a bad idea - didnt work.

Some ideas how to do that?



EDIT2: Some piece of code of my solution, ATTENTION! This is not the real code, I deleted a lot of lines for inserting here. There arent all releases etc. I think the solution is really dirty, but I didnt found a better solution for me...

Some important things:


cellDownloading: Array which knows
every cell which is downloading at
the moment
progressDictionary: Knows the progress of every cell
cellDictionary: Knows every cell, filled up in the cellsForRowAtIndexpath delegte of the tableview


I also cant copy the whole code, because there is a lot which have nothing to do with the whole process, but I give you the important steps.
My cells are created through parsing a xml, so every cell has got a setId in my case.

//////////////////
// Downloader.mm
//////////////////

method to download asynchron

-(void)startAsynchronousDownload:(NSString*)path{    

// generate notification
NSMutableDictionary *userInfo = [[NSMutableDictionary alloc] init];
NSNumber *tmpSetId = [NSNumber numberWithInteger:setId];

[userInfo setObject:tmpSetId forKey:@""setId""];

NSNotification* notification = [NSNotification notificationWithName:@""downloadStackNotification"" object:self userInfo:userInfo];  
[[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] postNotification:notification];  

// add some infos...
NSMutableDictionary *dictionary = [[NSMutableDictionary alloc] init];
[dictionary setObject:tmpSetId forKey:@""setId""];
// perhaps more here

// asynchronous download handling
NSOperationQueue *queue = [NSOperationQueue alloc] init];
NSInvocationOperation *operation = [[NSInvocationOperation alloc] initWithTarget:self selector:@selector(downloadImagesWithDictionary:) object:dictionary];

// release
[operation release];
[dictionary release];
[userInfo release];
}


In my example the selector downloadImagesWithDictionary downloads some images, for every downloaded image I send a notification. Every stack of images have a setId in my case.

[...]
    NSMutableDictionary *userInfo = [[NSMutableDictionary alloc] init];
    NSNumber *sliceCounter = [NSNumber numberWithInt:i];
    NSNumber *amount = [NSNumber numberWithInt:amountOfImages];
    NSNumber *tmpSetId = [NSNumber numberWithInteger:setId];

    [userInfo setObject:sliceCounter forKey:@""actualImage""];
    [userInfo setObject:amount forKey:@""allImages""];
    [userInfo setObject:tmpSetId forKey:@""setId""];
    NSNotification* notification = [NSNotification notificationWithName:@""downloadSliceNotification"" object:self userInfo:userInfo];  
    [[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] postNotification:notification ];  
[...]


////////////////////////////
// TableViewController.mm
////////////////////////////

Now we need to get the notifications to update our tableview

[[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] addObserver:self selector:@selector(downloadSliceNotification:) name:@""downloadSliceNotification"" object:nil];
[[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] addObserver:self selector:@selector(downloadStackNotification:) name:@""downloadStackNotification"" object:nil];


We need a cell dictionary to know all indexpath of our existing tableview cells.
Fill them in the cellForRowAtIndexPath delegate

[cellDictionary setObject:indexPath forKey:[NSString stringWithFormat:@""%d"",cellSetId]];


Now we create the handler to do somehting if we got a notification
First the handler if the download starts
I have got a progress dictionary which knows every progress of every cell
I can identify every cell by the setId - perhaps u have to change that a little bit

- (void)downloadStackNotification:(NSNotification*)notification {  
NSDictionary *userInfo = [notification userInfo];
NSNumber *setId = [userInfo objectForKey:@""setId""];

NSNumber *progress = [NSNumber numberWithInt:0];    
[progressDictionary setObject:progress forKey:[setId stringValue]];

// add cell to downloadlist
[cellDownloading addObject:[setId stringValue]];


} 

Now for every download step(in my case one image). 
Calculate process and update the dictionary, get the cell to update the progress

- (void)downloadSliceNotification:(NSNotification*)notification {  
NSDictionary *userInfo = [notification userInfo];
NSNumber *sliceCounter = [userInfo objectForKey:@""actualImage""];
NSNumber *amount = [userInfo objectForKey:@""allImages""]; 
NSNumber *setId = [userInfo objectForKey:@""setId""]; 

NSNumber *progress = [NSNumber numberWithFloat:(100/[amount floatValue])*[sliceCounter floatValue]];      

[progressDictionary setObject:progress forKey:[setId stringValue]];
NSIndexPath* indexPath = [cellDictionary objectForKey:[setId stringValue]];

CustomServerCell* cell = (CustomServerCell*)[self.tableView cellForRowAtIndexPath:indexPath];
NSMutableDictionary *downloadData = [[NSMutableDictionary alloc] init];
[downloadData setObject:cell forKey:@""cell""];
[downloadData setObject:sliceCounter forKey:@""actualImage""];
[downloadData setObject:amount forKey:@""allImages""];

[self performSelectorOnMainThread:@selector(updateProgressWithDictionary:) withObject:downloadData waitUntilDone:NO];
} 


Update the cell

-(void)updateProgressWithDictionary:(NSMutableDictionary*)downloadData {

CustomServerCell* cell = (CustomServerCell*)[downloadData objectForKey:@""cell""];
NSNumber *sliceCounter = [downloadData objectForKey:@""actualImage""];
NSNumber *amount = [downloadData objectForKey:@""allImages""];

cell.progressView.hidden = FALSE;
NSNumber *tmpProgress = [progressDictionary objectForKey:[NSString stringWithFormat:@""%d"",cell.progressView.tag]];
cell.progressView.progress = [tmpProgress floatValue]/100;
cell.statusLabel.text = [NSString stringWithFormat:@""download slice %d / %d"",[sliceCounter integerValue],[amount integerValue]];


}
","Try using

[self performSelectorOnMainThread:@selector(updateProgressBar:) withObject: [NSNumber numberWithFloat:pr] waitUntilDone: YES] 


instead of 

progressView.progress += 0.1; // or any other number for that matter

I do not understand what AngularUI-Bootstrap is complaining about as being undefined.  If I remove the comment on the top-most return the values show up fine.  The console.log output in the success also return all the values I'm expecting in an array.

What am I missing that would cause AngularUI-Bootstrap not see the returned array?

5566,5566,8840,Why would analysts recommend buying companies with negative net income?,"Can anyone explain why some analysts recommend companies in the biopharmacy sector as a ""buy"" even though they have high R&amp;D costs and no real profit?

I followed three companies and I see the same story. The only positive number is income, and only in one case does it cover expenses after net borrowing. For the next four in a row, the net income the net income is below zero. 

Why are these companies a buy?
",hephestos,https://money.stackexchange.com/users/2031,"The biotechnology sector as a whole is a popular buy recommendation among some analysts these days for a few reasons. 


Some analysts feel that the high costs in R&amp;D, even without much profit, are a positive sign for growth because it means a company is working towards finding the next ""blockbuster drug"" or the next class of such drugs. There haven't been many new classes of blockbuster drugs since the development of SSRI's and statins, and many of the new drugs that have been developed have been tweaks to existing classes of drugs. Some analysts feel that ""it's about time"" for a new class of blockbuster drugs to hit the market. A new blockbuster drug means significant profits for the company that develops it; a new class of blockbuster drugs means significant profits for the whole industry. 
Since about 2009, the Food and Drug Administration has been more lenient in its approval of new drugs. This wave of new approvals has reduced R&amp;D costs for companies because they don't need to go back to the lab or earlier phases of clinical trials and continually tweak their drugs in order to gain approval. This has also made some analysts optimistic.
Genetic engineering is considered an up-and-coming field with potentially significant applications to the pharmaceutical industry. Advances in this field may increase profits for the pharm industry, but since biotech companies are often the ones producing the engineering equipment, research, etc. such advances could be a major source of revenue for the entire biotech industry. 
In the US and in the developed world as a whole, the elderly population is growing, and since people consume more medicine as they grow older, this could lead to higher profits for companies involved in the production of pharmaceuticals (which includes biotech companies, of course) in the long run. 
In the US, the passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act expanded insurance coverage, which gives more people the means to afford pharmaceuticals. Also, in general, people consume more healthcare services when they have insurance (this is called moral hazard), so some analysts expect that the expansion of insurance coverage will only lead to more profits for the pharmaceutical industry and biotechnology firms in general.
The global food crisis. As the climate changes, companies like Monsanto, which use various forms of genetic engineering to produce crop strains that can survive in increasingly hostile environments, look more and more appealing to places that need crops designed to grow in such environments. Any methods that could increase yields look increasingly popular, and biotechnology companies often market such methods. (As a side note, I know Monsanto is a contentious example, and there are a lot of misconceptions about ""genetically modified food"" and the genetic engineering methods they do, so I won't get into a debate about that). 
In general, technology is a popular subject right now. I've read analyst reports (from analysts that clearly don't follow the biotech sector) that base their forecasts for the biotech sector on the activities of companies like Dell, Zynga, HP, LinkedIn, Facebook, etc. Clearly, it's problematic when an analyst sees the word ""technology"" and automatically assumes that the biotech sector is responsive to the same factors as social media firms, hardware manufacturers, etc. This isn't to say that the biotech sector is completely isolated from this, but when I read a report that talks about Facebook's IPO being bad news for companies like Gilead Sciences without mentioning upcoming FDA decisions about Gilead's products or any biotech-specific factors, I'm not convinced the analyst has performed due diligence. 


I keep using the phrase ""some analysts"" because I want to stress that the opinions stated above aren't universal. Although they're popular, not everyone is so optimistic. Also, I don't want you to see these reasons and think that I'm making a buy recommendation, because I'm not. I'm not making a recommendation one way or another. 

I'm happy to clarify my answer too; I follow the biotechnology sector extensively. If you want to get a rough feel for the daily movements of the sector as a whole, a good place to start is IBB, the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology Index Fund. The four largest holdings are Regeneron, Gilead Sciences, Amgen, and Celgene, which are all big players in the industry (obviously). These are a little different from the big name pharma companies like Pfizer, Merck, Novartis, etc. but they're still considered pharma companies.

It's also worthwhile to follow the FDA press announcements. By the time the news is published there, it's probably already leaked or known to people in the industry (the biotech/pharm sectors are rife with accusations of insider trading), so you might not find trading opportunities, but it's important to get familiar with the information the releases contain if you want to know more about the industry. Volatility trades are always popular trades around FDA drug approvals.

4469,4469,7091,"Workflow for managing, organizing and sharing a large number of ""photos of strangers""?","Scenario

I'm going to be in a public area taking portraits of many people (for example, at a themed, public event, or while doing a 100 Strangers Project, etc..)

After taking someone's portrait, I want them to give them access to their portrait (and only theirs, not everyone else's).

So, given all the pictures I take that day, how can I keep track of all the photos (matching up them up with their portrait, and then providing them a way to see/share the photo)? Also, what token, if any, could I give them to find or receive their photo later on?

Requirements

The ideal solution for me would


give them access to only their portrait
minimize the amount of personal information I get from them at the time of encounter (a name only, for example. The assumption is that people would not want to give out their contact information.)
minimize wasting their time (in other words, be a socially elegant solution)
maximize the amount of time I spend shooting while I'm out ""in the field"" as opposed to bookkeeping

",Gary,https://english.stackexchange.com/users/34,"The second sense of determine is not “to forecast or predict”, but rather to “find out by investigation, reasoning, or calculation”, sense 4 in Merriam-Webster. Merriam-Webster gives other examples of this sense: “&lt;determine the answer to the problem&gt; &lt;determine a position at sea&gt;”.

If we take a look at the first ten results in newspapers for determine in the Corpus of Contemporary American English, we see this sense occurs in six of them:

","The second sense of determine is not “to forecast or predict”, but rather to “find out by investigation, reasoning, or calculation”, sense 4 in Merriam-Webster. Merriam-Webster gives other examples of this sense: “&lt;determine the answer to the problem&gt; &lt;determine a position at sea&gt;”.

If we take a look at the first ten results in newspapers for determine in the Corpus of Contemporary American English, we see this sense occurs in six of them:


jobs. // And so we acted robustly. And now it's time to determine whether or not this pro-growth package will actually work. // The checks will start  
onto Floor 10 -- - incognito, of course -- - and set out to determine whether it was truly what women want. // You know: Mirrors that make  
astronomy. Its original mission was to find a way for sailors at sea to determine longitude. Unlike latitude, which uses the equator as a starting position, there  
Sharpton stood with members of Officer Ridley's family and called for an investigation to determine whether the shooting was justified. //' Just as we are calling on the  
// Win or lose -- and the status of West's sore back could largely determine the outcome -- the future in New Orleans appears bright. The core players --  
, they lifted all sanctions. // Whether Clayton can do that hard work could determine if Flenoury can go to one of his two choice schools, Georgia or Duke  
worked with Kerviel was released after being questioned. Two investigating judges are trying to determine what, if anything, Kerviel's colleagues and superiors knew about his unauthorized trades  
because of my race? Sure. "" // He doesn't think race will determine who wins the election, however. Obama said most voters will make their choice  
confluence within the monument boundary, so right now Dinosaur is an incredible lab to determine the impact dams have on rivers. "" // Kleinschnitz, who started rowing the  
fight and every team gives it -- for a while. But early results can determine where a team keeps fighting all season and how confidently it battles in the close  


The only uses which are not the sense meaning “to find out” are #5, #6, #8, and #10. So, from this admittedly small sample it does appear that both senses enjoy approximately equally robust usage.

1998,1998,3191,Change of basis in non-linear Schrodinger equation,"At the mean-field level, the dynamics of a polariton condensate can be described by a type of nonlinear Schrodinger equation (Gross-Pitaevskii-type), for a classical (complex-number) wavefunction $\psi_{LP}$. Its form in momentum space reads:

\begin{multline}
i \frac{d}{dt}\psi_{LP}(k) =\left[\epsilon(k) 
-i\frac{\gamma(k)}{2}\right] \psi_{LP}(k) 
+F_{p}(k)\,\, e^{-i\omega_{p}t}  \\
+  \sum_{q_1,q_2} g_{k,q_1,q_2}\, \psi^{\star}_{LP}(q_1+q_2-k)
\, \psi_{LP}(q_1)\, \psi_{LP}(q_2).
\end{multline}

The function $\epsilon(k)$ is the dispersion of the particles (polaritons). The polaritons are a non-equilibrium system, due to their finite lifetime (damping rate $\gamma$). Therefore, they need continuous pumping with amplitude $F_p$ at energy $\omega_p$.
Finally, there exists a momentum-dependent nonlinear interaction $g_{k,q_1,q_2}$ that depends of the so-called Hopfield coefficients $X$ (simple functions of momentum) as:

\begin{equation}
g_{k,q_1,q_2}=g\, X^{\star}(k)\, X^{\star}(q_1+q_2-k)\, X(q_1)\, X(q_2)
\end{equation}

How can one transform the equation for $\psi$ to real-space?
",Andrei,https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/24609,"Here is my attempt at an answer, following the suggestion of @Lagerbaer. We first subtitute the Fourier Transform for $\psi_{LP}(k)$,

\begin{equation}
\psi_{LP}(k)=\int dxe^{-ikx}\psi_{LP}(x),
\end{equation}

and get

\begin{multline}
\int dxe^{-ikx}i\frac{d}{dt}\psi_{LP}(x)=\int dx\left[\epsilon(k)-i\frac{\gamma(k)}{2}\right]e^{-ikx}\psi_{LP}(x)\\+F_{p}(k)\,\, e^{-i\omega_{p}t}
+\int dx_{3}dx_{1}dx_{2}\\ \times \sum_{q_{1},q_{2}}g_{k,q_{1},q_{2}}\, e^{i(q_{1}+q_{2}-k)x_{3}}\psi_{LP}^{\star}(x_{3})\, e^{-iq_{1}x_{1}}\psi_{LP}(x_{1})\, e^{-iq_{2}x_{2}}\psi_{LP}(x_{2}).
\end{multline}

In order to simplify this expression, we need to apply the inverse transform to both sides (multiply by $\int dke^{ikx}$), obtaining

\begin{multline}
i\frac{d}{dt}\psi_{LP}(x)=\int dx^{\prime}\psi_{LP}(x^{\prime})\int dk\left[\epsilon(k)-i\frac{\gamma(k)}{2}\right]e^{ik(x-x^{\prime})}+F_{p}e^{i(k_{p}x-\omega_{p}t)}\\
+\int dke^{ikx}\int dx_{3}dx_{1}dx_{2}\\
\times\sum_{q_{1},q_{2}}g_{k,q_{1},q_{2}}\, e^{i(q_{1}+q_{2}-k)x_{3}}\psi_{LP}^{\star}(x_{3})\, e^{-iq_{1}x_{1}}\psi_{LP}(x_{1})\, e^{-iq_{2}x_{2}}\psi_{LP}(x_{2}).
\end{multline}

Now we look at an integral of the form $\int dx^{\prime}\psi_{LP}(x^{\prime})\int dkf(k)e^{ik(x-x^{\prime})}$, for a generic function $f(k)$. We expand our generic function in a Taylor Series around $k=0$, and get:

\begin{equation}
\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{f^{(n)}(0)}{n!}\int dx^{\prime}\psi_{LP}(x^{\prime})\int dkk^{n}e^{ik(x-x^{\prime})}=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{f^{(n)}(0)}{n!}\left(-i\right)^{n}\int dx^{\prime}\psi_{LP}(x^{\prime})\partial_{x}^{n}\delta(x-x^{\prime})
\end{equation}

where we have used the well-known relation $\int dkk{}^{n}e^{ik(x-x^{\prime})}=\left(-i\right)^{n}\partial_{x}^{n}\delta(x-x^{\prime})$.

Moving the derivative operator to act on $\psi$ (integration by parts), we finally obtain

\begin{equation}
\int dx^{\prime}\psi_{LP}(x^{\prime})\int dkf(k)e^{ik(x-x^{\prime})}=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{f^{(n)}(0)}{n!}(i\partial_{x})^{n}\psi_{LP}(x)=f(i\partial_{x})\psi_{LP}(x)
\end{equation}

Therefore, the first term on the RHS of our equation simplifies to $\left[\epsilon(i\partial_{x})-i\frac{\gamma(i\partial_{x})}{2}\right]\psi_{LP}(x)$ and we are left dealing with the interaction term.

\begin{equation}
\int dx_{3}\psi_{LP}^{\star}(x_{3})\int dx_{1}\psi_{LP}(x_{1})\int dq_{1}e^{iq_{1}(x_{3}-x_{1})}\int dx_{2}\psi_{LP}(x_{2})\int dq_{2}e^{iq_{2}(x_{3}-x_{2})}\int dkg(k,q_{1},q_{2})e^{ik(x-x_{3})}
\end{equation}

Substituting the form of $g(k,q_{1},q_{2})$, we get

\begin{equation}
g\int dx_{3}\psi_{LP}^{\star}(x_{3})\int dx_{1}\psi_{LP}(x_{1})\int dq_{1}X(q_{1})e^{iq_{1}(x_{3}-x_{1})}\int dx_{2}\psi_{LP}(x_{2})\int dq_{2}X(q_{2})e^{iq_{2}(x_{3}-x_{2})}\int dk\, X^{\star}(k)\, X^{\star}(q_{1}+q_{2}-k)\, e^{ik(x-x_{3})}

Its form in momentum space reads:

\begin{multline}
i \frac{d}{dt}\psi_{LP}(k) =\left[\epsilon(k) 
-i\frac{\gamma(k)}{2}\right] \psi_{LP}(k) 
+F_{p}(k)\,\, e^{-i\omega_{p}t}  \\
+  \sum_{q_1,q_2} g_{k,q_1,q_2}\, \psi^{\star}_{LP}(q_1+q_2-k)
\, \psi_{LP}(q_1)\, \psi_{LP}(q_2).
\end{multline}

The function $\epsilon(k)$ is the dispersion of the particles (polaritons). The polaritons are a non-equilibrium system, due to their finite lifetime (damping rate $\gamma$). Therefore, they need continuous pumping with amplitude $F_p$ at energy $\omega_p$.
Finally, there exists a momentum-dependent nonlinear interaction $g_{k,q_1,q_2}$ that depends of the so-called Hopfield coefficients $X$ (simple functions of momentum) as:

\begin{equation}
g_{k,q_1,q_2}=g\, X^{\star}(k)\, X^{\star}(q_1+q_2-k)\, X(q_1)\, X(q_2)
\end{equation}

How can one transform the equation for $\psi$ to real-space?
","Here is my attempt at an answer, following the suggestion of @Lagerbaer. We first subtitute the Fourier Transform for $\psi_{LP}(k)$,

\begin{equation}
\psi_{LP}(k)=\int dxe^{-ikx}\psi_{LP}(x),
\end{equation}

and get

\begin{multline}
\int dxe^{-ikx}i\frac{d}{dt}\psi_{LP}(x)=\int dx\left[\epsilon(k)-i\frac{\gamma(k)}{2}\right]e^{-ikx}\psi_{LP}(x)\\+F_{p}(k)\,\, e^{-i\omega_{p}t}
+\int dx_{3}dx_{1}dx_{2}\\ \times \sum_{q_{1},q_{2}}g_{k,q_{1},q_{2}}\, e^{i(q_{1}+q_{2}-k)x_{3}}\psi_{LP}^{\star}(x_{3})\, e^{-iq_{1}x_{1}}\psi_{LP}(x_{1})\, e^{-iq_{2}x_{2}}\psi_{LP}(x_{2}).
\end{multline}

In order to simplify this expression, we need to apply the inverse transform to both sides (multiply by $\int dke^{ikx}$), obtaining

\begin{multline}
i\frac{d}{dt}\psi_{LP}(x)=\int dx^{\prime}\psi_{LP}(x^{\prime})\int dk\left[\epsilon(k)-i\frac{\gamma(k)}{2}\right]e^{ik(x-x^{\prime})}+F_{p}e^{i(k_{p}x-\omega_{p}t)}\\
+\int dke^{ikx}\int dx_{3}dx_{1}dx_{2}\\
\times\sum_{q_{1},q_{2}}g_{k,q_{1},q_{2}}\, e^{i(q_{1}+q_{2}-k)x_{3}}\psi_{LP}^{\star}(x_{3})\, e^{-iq_{1}x_{1}}\psi_{LP}(x_{1})\, e^{-iq_{2}x_{2}}\psi_{LP}(x_{2}).
\end{multline}

Now we look at an integral of the form $\int dx^{\prime}\psi_{LP}(x^{\prime})\int dkf(k)e^{ik(x-x^{\prime})}$, for a generic function $f(k)$. We expand our generic function in a Taylor Series around $k=0$, and get:

\begin{equation}
\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{f^{(n)}(0)}{n!}\int dx^{\prime}\psi_{LP}(x^{\prime})\int dkk^{n}e^{ik(x-x^{\prime})}=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{f^{(n)}(0)}{n!}\left(-i\right)^{n}\int dx^{\prime}\psi_{LP}(x^{\prime})\partial_{x}^{n}\delta(x-x^{\prime})
\end{equation}

where we have used the well-known relation $\int dkk{}^{n}e^{ik(x-x^{\prime})}=\left(-i\right)^{n}\partial_{x}^{n}\delta(x-x^{\prime})$.

Moving the derivative operator to act on $\psi$ (integration by parts), we finally obtain

\begin{equation}
\int dx^{\prime}\psi_{LP}(x^{\prime})\int dkf(k)e^{ik(x-x^{\prime})}=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{f^{(n)}(0)}{n!}(i\partial_{x})^{n}\psi_{LP}(x)=f(i\partial_{x})\psi_{LP}(x)
\end{equation}

Therefore, the first term on the RHS of our equation simplifies to $\left[\epsilon(i\partial_{x})-i\frac{\gamma(i\partial_{x})}{2}\right]\psi_{LP}(x)$ and we are left dealing with the interaction term.

\begin{equation}
\int dx_{3}\psi_{LP}^{\star}(x_{3})\int dx_{1}\psi_{LP}(x_{1})\int dq_{1}e^{iq_{1}(x_{3}-x_{1})}\int dx_{2}\psi_{LP}(x_{2})\int dq_{2}e^{iq_{2}(x_{3}-x_{2})}\int dkg(k,q_{1},q_{2})e^{ik(x-x_{3})}
\end{equation}

Substituting the form of $g(k,q_{1},q_{2})$, we get

\begin{equation}
g\int dx_{3}\psi_{LP}^{\star}(x_{3})\int dx_{1}\psi_{LP}(x_{1})\int dq_{1}X(q_{1})e^{iq_{1}(x_{3}-x_{1})}\int dx_{2}\psi_{LP}(x_{2})\int dq_{2}X(q_{2})e^{iq_{2}(x_{3}-x_{2})}\int dk\, X^{\star}(k)\, X^{\star}(q_{1}+q_{2}-k)\, e^{ik(x-x_{3})}
\end{equation}

  Ideally the DH group would match or exceed the RSA key size but 1024-bit DHE is arguably better than straight 2048-bit RSA so you can get away with that if you want to.


So it appears that he is advocating something like DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA with 1024-bit ephemeral DH keys over AES256-SHA with a 2048-bit RSA key. My understanding is that 1024-bit DH (ephemeral or not) is of comparable security to 1024-bit RSA. Why would he make such a recommendation? Does he value the forward secrecy offered by DHE that much?
",safsaf32,https://security.stackexchange.com/users/31140,"There are two sides to the question:


Perfect Forward Secrecy: by using a ""DHE"" cipher suite, you actually encrypt the data with regards to a DH private key which never gets stored on any disk. For any given SSL session, the encryption may be cracked if the attacker succeeds at cryptanalysing the public key used for encryption (DH for a DHE cipher suite, RSA for a RSA cipher suite), or if the attacker steals a copy of the private key. The latter occurrence is actually much more probable in practice for a RSA-based cipher suite; and the point of PFS is to remove that threat.
RSA vs Diffie-Hellman: for the time being, the best known methods for breaking RSA and DH entail solving two hard problems, integer factorization and discrete logarithm respectively. It so happens that for both problem, the fastest known algorithm is the General Number Field Sieve (though initially a factorization algorithm, a variant of GNFS can be applied to discrete logarithm). For asymptotic complexity, RSA and DH are thus of equivalent hardness when the DH modulus has the same size as the RSA modulus.

However, in practical term, DH is a tad harder. GNFS includes several phases, the two main being the sieve and then the linear reduction. For a big modulus, the linear reduction becomes the bottleneck because of the sheer size of the matrix. For a given modulus size, you will get the same number of elements in the two matrices (the one for RSA and the one for DH), but the matrix elements are simple bits in the RSA case, vs integers modulo p in the DH case. Thus, the DH matrix is larger.

It won't make n-bit DH as ""hard"" as 2n-bit RSA, though. If we look at the records, we see 768-bit for RSA, 530-bit for DH; and the DH case used less raw power. Moreover, it is not completely justified to compare the hardness of 1024-bit DH with the hardness of 2048-bit RSA, since both are in the ""cannot break it"" zone.


A summary of all this goes thus: while 1024-bit DH is somewhat stronger (theoretically) than 1024-bit RSA, the difference is slight (say, 1024-bit DH is like 1200-bit RSA at most). But in practical terms the risk of private key theft, for a non-ephemeral key, dwarfs out any cryptanalytic risk for any RSA or DH of 1024 bits or more; in that sense, PFS is a must-have and DHE with a 1024-bit DH key is much safer than RSA-based cipher suites, regardless of the RSA key size.

",Buschi Sergio,https://mathoverflow.net/users/6262,"It's a good question; the answer is no. 

Suppose $F \dashv F^{op}$ with unit $\eta: 1_C \to F^{op} F$ and counit $\varepsilon: F F^{op} \to 1_{C^{op}}$. Since $\varepsilon$ is the unique transformation $\theta: F F^{op} \to 1$ such that

the question is whether $F^{op}\eta^{op} = (\eta F^{op})^{-1}$. 

Take $C$ to be an commutative group $G$, considered as a category with one object $\bullet$. Here we may simply identify $G^{op}$ with $G$, i.e., the identity $1_G \colon G \to G$ may be seen as a contravariant functor because we have $1_G(g h) = 1_G(h)1_A(g)$ by commutativity. Now take $F$ and therefore $F^{op}$ to be the identity on $G$. Any element $u \in G$ as morphism $\bullet \to \bullet = F^{op} F \bullet$ can serve as the unit transformation (naturality also follows from commutativity). But then, as soon as $u$ is not equal to $u^{-1}$, we have $F^{op}u^{op} = u \neq u^{-1} = (u F^{op})^{-1}$. Therefore taking $G$ to be the additive group $\mathbb{Z}$ and $u = 1 \in \mathbb{Z}$, we reach a counterexample.

Right now this program accesses a file from a file manager that takes the selected files path and sets it to the 'mFilename' EditText field. The show PDF button listener below shows the String 'pdffilename' gets assigned the String contained in the 'mFilename' EditText field. The PdfViewerActivity is started and the String 'pdffilename' is passed as an Extra. In the onCreate() the intent is checked if null or not. This is where I think the change can/should be made. The String 'pdffilename' is assigned what you see below. What I want to do is store the PDF files in one of two ways... int the 'res/raw/example_folder/example.pdf' or in the assets folder. I want to assign 'pdffilename' programmatically with the path for where I am storing these PDF files. I have tried many different approaches all of which have either did not compile, caused errors, or caused a ""file: res/raw/example_folder/example.pdf does not exist!"".

use Batik's JPEGTranscoder to transcode svg into image with this svg drawings and white background, save this image

    setContentView(R.layout.main);

So, from the PreLoaderView, I'd like to pass the @Model back to the controller for use with the SolicitorActionReport_Load(). Is this possible to do?
","You shouldn't do that in a classic MVC application. You should create and populate the model once in the controller, feed it to the view in a single pass, and then forget about it after that until the next round trip to the server. You shouldn't throw it back and forth to the controller."
3395,3395,5413,Dealing with digital circuits and their associated switching speed?,"When designing a digital one-minute counting circuit I came across a difficult problem. 

Basically, I designed the circuit to drive the (normally HIGH) clock of the 10s slot low if the 1s slot's current state was 9 (actually, just if the first and last bits are HIGH -> 1001)

The devices I am using are positive edge, so when the 1s slot returns to zero the condition is no longer satisfied - therefore the clock returns to a HIGH state and increments the 10s slot.

The problem is that I was getting double clock problems(7->8 transition and the designed clock mechanism).   

It turns out that there was just enough delay in the switching between 7 -> 8 (0111 -> 1000) that the first/last bit HIGH condition is satisfied:

i.e., some combination occurs in the transition period to register a logical HIGH at the output

1001 1011 1101 1111

The temporary solution to the problem I came up with was to actually keep the clock for the 10s slot LOW until the condition where the 1s slot equals 0 (0000) is satisfied(So, essentially clock WHEN we get to the state as opposed to before). However, this solution requires too many gates (a 4-input NOR minimum). My previous design was actually fed from another part in the design that is already present, so it didn't require any additional circuitry. 

Any ideas on a more efficient solution?  




The IC's used in this design are the 74LS47 (7Segment decoder) and the 74LS163 (4-bit binary counter). The pull-down resistor inclusion is a mechanism to set the counters to 00 and hold while the switch is closed. 
",sherrellbc,https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/26864,"The way I see it, you're causing problems for yourself by using multiple clock domains, and worse, deriving a clock from data. The problem with data is that it has to settle. That's why we have separate clocks. A combinatorial circuit which evaluates some variables and then drives a clock invites trouble.

Secondly, if you're going to kludge it, at least do it right. You cannot detect a 9 by noting that the first and last of four bits bit are 1. If you want a signal which fires when there is a 9, you must evaluate all four bits earnestly and trigger that signal only when they are 1001.

There is no reason not to design this in such a way that a single clock is distributed to all the chips. Then it's a matter of running the clock slowly enough that all inputs and outputs settle before each edge arrives.

Read the data sheet. The TI one clearly says ""The carry look-ahead circuitry provides for n-bit synchronous applications without additional gating. Instrumental in accomplishing this function are two count-enable inputs and a ripple carry output. Both count enable inputs P and T must be high to count [...]"".

It sounds like these chips are intended to be hooked up together easily. You can prevent the upper digit from counting up on the next clock edge by de-asserting its count enable inputs. Whenever the lower digit is nine, your circuitry can enable the upper digit chip to count, and also set up the lower digit to perform a synchronous reset. 

When the next clock edge arrives (to all chips), the upper digit counts up, and the other flips to zero.
