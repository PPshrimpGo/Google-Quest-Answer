4698,4698,7449,"Control Fields vs Heap ""Mock"" Fields for Branching Trigger Behavior","I've seen solutions that talk about adding control fields to allow for clever trigger branching in problems like this. I know that works, but it annoys me (feels architecturally wrong) to create such fields if it can be avoided. I've also seen solutions that have to do with using static variables for a similar purpose, but I have found occasions where one global flag is not good enough because I need the flag per record. I've tried both out and I think I want something in the middle. Something like this:

global without sharing class HeapControl {
    private static Map&lt;Id, Set&lt;String&gt;&gt; recordTags = new Map&lt;Id, Set&lt;String&gt;&gt;();
    public static void AddRecordTag(Id rowId, String tag) {
        if (recordTags.containsKey(rowId)) {
            Set&lt;String&gt; tagsForThisRow = recordTags.get(rowId);
            if (!tagsForThisRow.contains(tag)) {
                tagsForThisRow.add(tag);
            }
        } else {
            recordTags.put(rowId, new Set&lt;String&gt; { tag });
        }
    }
    public static boolean IsRecordTagged(Id rowId, String tag) {
        if (recordTags.containsKey(rowId)) {
            Set&lt;String&gt; tagsForThisRow = recordTags.get(rowId);
            if (tagsForThisRow.contains(tag)) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }

    @IsTest 
    public static void HeapDemo() {
        Account a = new Account(Name = 'Testing');
        insert a;
        HeapControl.AddRecordTag(a.Id, 'Control-Field-Name-1');
        a.Name = 'Testing2';
        update a;
        // A trigger that fired on Account Update could check the HeapControl for the record like this
        system.assert(HeapControl.IsRecordTagged(a.Id, 'Control-Field-Name-1'));
    }
}


I'd like a pro-con analysis of using real control fields vs mock control fields on the heap (doesn't have to be my code, anything along the lines of static Map&lt;Id, ...&gt;, if you know of a field-tested version of this code please share). 

In my not-yet-field-tested opinion, the control field concept evolved out of a workflow world, but once you decide to drop down to triggers the heap will serve you better--at least you don't have to create control fields for every little trigger branch.

I apologize this isn't standard Q&amp;A format--but this issue has been burning in my mind for months now and I think there are a lot of Salesforce developers (writing business process triggers in particular) that wrestle with this regularly. Thanks in advance for sharing your wisdom and experience!
",twamley,https://salesforce.stackexchange.com/users/773,"At the outset, the way I look at it, the first line of the question is a bit of an apples with oranges comparison, i.e. use of Control Fields in a Workflow - Trigger distributed situation Vs in a Trigger only scenario.

Analysing this problem in parts may help answer each of the two facets, one at a time.

One - the interplay of Workflows and Triggers to implement Business Logic. It is up for debate how logic should be distributed, if not all of it can be accomplished in a trigger. Should workflows be used to implement as much is feasible, and only the absolute can't do's must live in a trigger. In my opinion yes, unless the resulting complexity is insanely great. Using declarative features provisioned by the platform allows for taking advantage of any of the forthcoming features of the platform, for eg. cross object workflows precluded the needs for at least some of those early-days cross object triggers.

If you need to straddle logic across workflows and triggers, the 'heap' is the database, and control fields end up becoming the 'static' heap variables.

This is the only situation in which, in my opinion, control fields may be advocated.

The other facet is the use cases for use of control fields - If the resulting complexity of a distributed operation is too great, or if all of it can only be implemented in a trigger, than static 'heap' variables make the most sense, I can't see the needs for any entity specific control variables, although there may be a limited case for User level control fields, particularly in cases, where doing so may prove more efficient to streamline data integration / migration processes.

Immediate Implications

Just talking a little bit about your other question that led to this thread, you are looking at the use of Control Field to distribute logic between a trigger and a workflow vs customising the input using Visualforce, so you can clearly demarcate the source of the change.

Going down a VisualForce route (which I have done for cases like OpportunityContactRoles, where triggers / workflows are not possible) means investing in a test class besides the cost of maintainability and the danger of subverting any new features that become available in out of the box page layouts, eg. inline editing that came to PageLayouts, and it was some time, before that became available in Visualforce. Declarative should always be the preferable approach, unless there are really strong motivations for going custom, as more often than not, it ends up being more expensive in the long run (the cost of maintainability, test classes and deployment inclusive)

The company wants to keep the old name of ""server"", i did not want to do that and was thinking of just making a cname alias in AD DNS forward lookup zone to point to the new ip address of server2 but you can reference it as server. In order to do the alias i would naturally remove or rename the old server or just unjoin it from the domain altogether.

I have read that you can just rename a computer to a previous name in AD as long as you have unjoined and removed it from the appropirate list under Active Directory? Can i just rename a server that is a member server in a domain? Do i have to change the sid or run newsid?

",dasko,https://serverfault.com/users/90428,"I am assuming that SERVER and SERVER2 are both member server computers and not domain controller computers.

When I replace old server computers I try and assign the name of the old server computer I'm replacing to the new machine. This is a common practice. (If you're consolidating servers then that's a a whole different ""can of worms"".)

There's no problem with renaming a domain member server computer after it's joined to the domain. (Supposedly you can rename domain controllers in the Server 2008 version of Active Directory, but I haven't tried it yet.) Of course, in the case of re-using a name that was already assigned to another computer, you'll want to either take the original computer holding that name offline or rename it.

I've done what you're describing many, many times with various versions of Windows. From the point you've described, I'd rename ""SERVER"" to ""OLDSERVER"", and ""SERVER2"" to ""SERVER"", leaving both joined to the domain throughout the process. You don't have to disjoin ""SERVER"" from the domain in this process. Once you've renamed ""SERVER"" while joined to the domain to ""OLDSERVER"", the object in the AD previously named ""SERVER"" will change to ""OLDSERVER"", freeing the name ""SERVER"" to be assigned to ""SERVER2"".

As an aside: I have no idea why you'd be running ""newsid"" unless you installed the system from a disk image (and even then, you should be using SYSPREP to change the SID). You don't need to regnerate the SID unless the SID is a duplicate of another machine's (like if the machine is a disk cloned image of another machine).

I've done what you're describing many, many times with various versions of Windows. From the point you've described, I'd rename ""SERVER"" to ""OLDSERVER"", and ""SERVER2"" to ""SERVER"", leaving both joined to the domain throughout the process. You don't have to disjoin ""SERVER"" from the domain in this process. Once you've renamed ""SERVER"" while joined to the domain to ""OLDSERVER"", the object in the AD previously named ""SERVER"" will change to ""OLDSERVER"", freeing the name ""SERVER"" to be assigned to ""SERVER2"".

As an aside: I have no idea why you'd be running ""newsid"" unless you installed the system from a disk image (and even then, you should be using SYSPREP to change the SID). You don't need to regnerate the SID unless the SID is a duplicate of another machine's (like if the machine is a disk cloned image of another machine).

4164,4164,6636,Which color scheme to choose for applications that require long work hours?,"I'm working on a ERP / Accounting (lots of tables and data) web app and was wondering what color scheme would be appropriate for this type of application?

2588,2588,4117,.NET - VB - OOP - Partial Class - How to create Partial Constructors,"I have a Partial Class in a file MainFile.vb with a constructor like this:

Partial Class MyAwesomeClass

    ' The constructor - Name it MainConstructor
    Public Sub New(Dim x As Integer)
        ' Some awesome code here
        Line1_of_code()
        Line2_of_code()
        Line3_of_code()
    End Sub

End Class


Now I want to add some more lines of code in the same constructor i.e. MainConstructor but my problem(s) is/are:


I can't edit the file MainFile.vb
I can't create another constructor
All I can do is -- since the MyAwesomeClass is a Partial Class; I can create another file e.g. ExtendedFile.vb and write my lines of code


So I'm trying to do like this which is not allowed in .NET:

Partial Class MyAwesomeClass

    ' The extended constructor - Name it ExtConstructor
    Public Sub New(Dim x As Integer) ' Boom!!!! Error: Duplicate constructor with same kind of arguments
        ' my extended awesome code here
        Line4_of_code()
        Line5_of_code()
        Line6_of_code()
    End Sub

End Class


Ultimately I want to do something like - When I create an object of MyAwesomeClass; it should execute Line1_of_code() to Line6_of_code(). I.e.

Dim objAwesome As New MyAwesomeClass(5) ' Any Integer will do


should execute all the below lines for objAwesome (and in the same order, too)

Line1_of_code()
Line2_of_code()
Line3_of_code()
Line4_of_code()
Line5_of_code()
Line6_of_code()

",Ruchir Gupta,https://stackoverflow.com/users/3832403,"You can think of a partial class as code in separate files. Then compiler will merge it in one class file.

280,280,452,"What is the lesser evil, degassing too early or too late?","Suppose that I have made bread dough and it is supposed to be degassed around 90 min after kneading (t+90). Suppose that I have to leave home at t+30 and will be back sometime between t+120 and t+150. 

What is better for the dough, to degas it too early or to degas it too late? I know I can try to influence the duration of the first rising by changing the temperature (I could either put it in the fridge or in an oven preheated to 50°C, turned off and cracked open). But I doubt that the dough's internal temperature will change substantially during these short times. 

So, what is the better strategy? Warm it and degas early, or cool it and degas late? 

For the record, I am talking about a high-hydration bread (86%), with sugar, but no fat, 2.8% yeast. But if the hydration, leanness and yeast amount have an influence on the decision, I would like to hear about that too. (Assume that for any yeast amount, the time period before degassing has been calculated to be correct for it). 
",rumtscho,https://cooking.stackexchange.com/users/4638,"I find it's best to judge by texture and dough volume rather than by rising time, because it's so variable with temperature.  

There is a trade-off for when to degas &amp; shape your bread, and where you draw the line depends on what you're aiming for with that particular batch. If you shape earlier, the loaves are easier to shape, and you get tighter, taller loaves. Shaping later yields a lighter, fluffier, more open crumb. 

The reason this trade-off exists is that the gluten stretches out during the initial rise as it traps gas.  If your first rise is brief, then the dough is more dense and has additional stretch, which aids in getting a good amount of tension on your formed loaf.  The tension in the loaf's skin directs its expansion upward, rather than spreading outward.  

Conversely, when the dough rises further, there is more incorporated gas, and the gluten has less elasticity.  It is more difficult to correctly shape the loaf, but the additional trapped gas bubbles act as nucleation sites to grow into larger air bubbles during the second rise.  This gives a less dense crumb, and may yield additional rising.

Note that all of this is assuming you make free-form loaves, with a rise-shape-proof process.  If you're doing bread-pan loaves, punching down can wait a little later.  For high-gluten flours, you'll want to rise and proof a bit longer, since they can hold more gas.  Sourdoughs need to be shaped earlier because they tend to turn into puddles otherwise.

  Is there any way to obtain an entire range of IPs from a reverse-DNS?


Not really, no; in extremely rare cases you might be able to do a DNS zone transfer query to get all the records in the zone (the whole /24, generally), but there's a very low chance that the name server you're querying will respond to this request. Expect one query per address for reverse DNS (sorry!).


  Now, would it be safe to assume that all at least all IPs from 128.151.162.* will also resolve to rochester.edu?


Generally speaking, probably, as a university they're likely to own the whole /24.  However, that's not a good rule to apply as a general case; a smaller school might not have a whole /24, or might not have it in reverse DNS.



The reverse DNS itself is going to be pretty hit-or-miss - in many cases it'll be just generated names under the ISP's hostnames or no records at all.  For better data, we're going to make things even more expensive - you should also look at data from whois.

For example, here's the info from that Rochester IP - it shows the size of the allocation (the whole /16 range, so in this case that applies to 128.151.*.*) and the organization it's allocated to.

The whois info should provide a great source of truth for the info you want, and has the upside of being able to see what range that applies to.  The downside is that for smaller allocations, a range will often just show as belonging to the ISP instead of the end customer.  Combining both whois and reverse DNS should provide the best information (and be ridiculously slow).

2445,2445,3903,Why do some transformers hum less or not at all when lightly loaded?,"It can be observed that large power transformers hum more under load. For example, when some devices are powered up, there is brief ""twang"" sound: a loud hum that quickly decays as the filter capacitors charge. Increased continuous hum from a transformer can indicate that the filter capacitors are leaking.

This question isn't about why transformers hum, but why do they hum less, or hardly at all, when not loaded. How is the electro-mechanics playing itself out to reduce the hum? After all, the fluctuating magnetic fields are there whether or not there is a load on the secondary winding.

",Roman A. Taycher,https://askubuntu.com/users/669,"You can always (re)install a package using dpkg:

In order to make a ""clean room"" installation, you can first purge the package and then install it again:

dpkg --purge brmfc7340lpr
dpkg --install brmfc7340lpr*.deb


You might need to add option --force-depends during purge, if some other package depends on brmfc7340lpr.

Update: Based on the transcript you posted, it seems that the
 brmfc7340lpr package cannot be (re)installed because its
 post-removal script is erroring out.

Those files are stored in directory /var/lib/dpkg/info; for each
package X, there can be any one of these scripts:


X.postinst run after the package has been installed, e.g., to
start services provided by the package.
X.prerm run before removing/purging the package, e.g., to
ensure that daemons provided by the package are stopped.
X.postrm run after the package has been removed, e.g., to
signal any service optionally using the package that it is no
longer available.  (For instance, a printer driver package might
want to signal cpus/lpr to remove printers depending on that
specific driver.)


Now, this brmfc7340lpr package seems to try to (re)start the lpd
printer daemon upon removal, which won't work as Ubuntu uses CUPS
instead: you should definitely look for a CUPS-compatible printer
driver -- see the link in Jorge Castro's answer. (I think this is a
bug in the package, as it should not restart the lpd service
unconditionally, but just reload it if it's already running.)

The best option to go forward comes from this launchpad
answer:

ln -s /etc/init.d/cpus /etc/init.d/lpd


This will effectively (re)start CUPS when the lpd service is instead
searched for.

Otherwise, I only see two options, both rather unpleasant:


Either edit the /var/lib/dpkg/info/brmfc7340lpr.postrm script,
and comment out the line that is invoking /etc/init.d/lpd start
(or restart or stop), (e.g., just replace it with /bin/true).
Another option is to just place exit 0 as the first non-comment
line in the script. This would be my favorite, but requires a bit
of confidence with editing shell scripts.
Install lpr, purge the brmfc6340lpr package, purge lpr: this
requires a bit of attention as lpr conflicts with the default

  What would let a private IP address get routed across servers?


Let's define what a private IP address is first: It's an address that, by convention, is agreed to not be routed on the Internet. That means that we agree as a community to never advertise those routes over BGP. It also means that that an ISP will probably kill those routes at the borders to their network to prevent them from possibly propagating.

That doesn't mean, however, that a private IP can't cross routers. It is very possible and even highly likely that Comcast uses private IP address ranges for networking equipment that isn't ever supposed to communicate with the Internet as a whole. Those routes may be forwarded by interior routing protocols throughout the entire Comcast network.

All in all, I'm going to guess that it's the case that your router performs NAT translation and then default-routes all traffic that isn't local to the next hop router, including private IP space. It's not very likely, though, that there are many Comcast routers sporting default routes that accidentally go all the way to a responding host with a private IP. It's my strong assumption that this is something purposeful. It might be a temperature sensor with remote monitoring or some other equally innocuous device that never needs to be talked to by anybody outside of Comcast.

The problem is that Mathematica can't calculate the last integral for any arbitrary $n$, although it can, correctly, calculate its value for hardcoded $n$s. Like $n=1,2,...$.

My question is:
Do you have any idea on how I could calculate it, perhaps by rewriting it a bit, or by using some other trick? In case it helps, the result should be $n^2\pi^2$.

Note: Actually it can be calculated with Cauchy's residue theorem, but I'd like to avoid taking that route, if possible. Though, if it can't be done otherwise, I will post a solution with residual calculation so that this question has an answer.

Is there a more mathematica-y way to label these plots?

Why does FourierTransform converge while same integral manually written does not?

3020,3020,4814,How is the energy/eigenvalue gap plot drawn for adiabatic quantum computation?,"I was going through arXiv:quant-ph/0001106v1, the first paper by Farhi on adiabatic quantum computation.
 Equation 2.24 says, $$\tilde{H}(s) = (1-s)H_B + sH_P$$ which means the adiabatic evolution starts from the ground state of $H_B$ and slowly evolves until it arrives at the ground state of $H_P$. In section 3.1, the one qubit example has the adiabatic Hamiltonian as $$\tilde{H}(s) = \begin{pmatrix}
s &amp; \epsilon (1-s) \\ 
\epsilon (1-s) &amp; 1-s   
\end{pmatrix}$$
I don't see how the plot of Figure 1 is drawn. In figure 1, Farhi plotted eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian for s while the range for s was 0 to 1. The Hamiltonian is supposed to evolve according to the Schrodinger equation (eq 2.1), $$i \frac{d}{dt} |\Psi (t) \rangle = H(t) |\Psi (t) \rangle$$
Was this evolution solved to draw the plot? Or did Farhi derive the formula for eigenvalues in terms of s using just matrix math and plotted accordingly?

3809,3809,6054,How should I tell Rails which of these content types to load for a given feed?,"I have content management system for an iOS app built with rails. Right now there a are three different types of content. The first two are just strings uploaded into a textfield by the user. One is twitter handles and hashtags, the other is URLs. The second type is photos. 

The user can upload as many individual instances of these types content as he/she wants to given a feed which will is the then passed to the iOS app via an API call to display. 

The current approach I am using is to have Feed, Picture, Twitter, and Webpage models. When the user crates a new Feed, they then associate the appropriate content with that feed via a one to many relationship between each Feed instance it's content instances. 

When it comes time to display to content the user has uploaded, a GET request for a given stream is generated and the Feed model then does the following awful thing determine what type of content should be shown: 

 def Feed.get_content_for_feed(feed_id)
    return self.map_type_to_class(feed_id).get_content_for_feed(feed_id)
  end

  private

  def Feed.map_type_to_class(feed_id)
    feed_type_id = Feed.find(feed_id).feed_type_id
    not_yet_implemented = nil
    case stream_type_id
      when 1
        return Webpages
      when 2
        return Pictures
      when 3
        return not_yet_implemented
      when 4
        return Twitter
      when 5
        return not_yet_implemented
      when 6
        return not_yet_implemented
      when 7
        return not_yet_implemented
      when 8
        return not_yet_implemented
      else
        return nil

    end
  end


Then each content class implements a get_content_for_feed method to return the content:

def Twitter.get_content_for_feed(feed_id)
    tweet_urls = self.where(:feed_id =&gt; feed_id.to_i)
    if tweet_urls.empty?
      return []
    else
      return tweet_urls
    end
  end


So it just returns the appropriate class. This works, but I know that it is wrong, but I am not sure what I would be doing. 
",Ryan Collins,https://codereview.stackexchange.com/users/52811,"First a light review:

You've got a bug, I think. Your map_type_to_class sets a feed_type_id variable, but your case statement is looking at a stream_type_id variable that I don't see anywhere.

Second, don't use so many return statements. It's Ruby; returns are implicit. So this you don't need returns in if...else or case branches you have in your question. In idomatic Ruby, you only see return if someone specifically wants to exit a method early (and even that's rare with well-factored code).

Lastly, this bit is redundant

tweet_urls = self.where(:feed_id =&gt; feed_id.to_i)
if tweet_urls.empty?
  return []
else
  return tweet_urls
end


Which, to all intents and purposes is the same as simply:

self.where(:feed_id =&gt; feed_id.to_i)


It's implicitly returned, and it's array-like, so there's no need to do anything special. It's either empty or it's not. If you want something that's truly an Array instance (and not just duck-typed), you can append a .to_a.

Anyway, what you're looking for is the constantize method for strings. What you've got is a fairly simple has_many relationship, you just want something like a string item_type column on your Feed model that contains the class name (as a string) instead of your current numeric ID.

From there it's a matter of implementing a polymorphic has_many (Rails already has a polymorphic option for belongs_to but that's a to-one association).

You could simply do

def Feed
  def items
    klass = item_type.constantize
    klass.where(feed_id: id)
  end
end


(yes that could just be one line).

You won't have all the fancy collection methods, caching, and other nice stuff Rails provides for regular associations, but you can add that if you want or simply make do without it (I recommend the latter unless you find it to be bigger hassle).

So in your FeedsController (or wherever), you're looking at something like

def show
  feed = Feed.find(params[:id])
  render json: feed.items
end


That should work as a super-minimal implementation. The point is really just that you store the class name, which you can then turn from a string into a class name constant with constantize.



Alternatively, you could use Rails' built-in associations, but there's more setup involved and it's not as clean to look at. Again, you'll want an item_type string column.

def Feed
  has_many :webpages # the class name Webpage is implicit
  has_many :pictures
  has_many :twitters # yuck, not a good name, but it'll imply the Twitter class

  def items
    association = item_type.underscore.pluralize # convert a class name to an association name
    send(associtation) # call the association method (e.g. `webpages`)
  end
end


The main advantage is that the items method is just a shortcut that provides the correct association object, so you have all the usual convenience methods. So you can do something like this for a webpage-type feed

Feed.find(some_id).items.create(params[:url])


Of course, the major issue is that it's not clear what's going on. Is items a collection of Picture? Of Webpage? If you just blindly try to create a Picture record from params meant for a webpage, things get messy.

So I'd stick to the first version, where items isn't an opaque alias for an association, and instead work a bit harder when adding new records and such.

1193,1193,1876,Understanding the static keyword,"I have some experience in developing with Java, Javascript and PHP.

I am reading Microsoft Visual C# 2010 Step by Step which I feel it is a very good book on introducing you to the C# language.

I seem to be having problems in understanding the static keyword. From what I understand this far if a class is declared static all methods and variable have to be static. The main method always is a static method so in the class that the main method exists all variables and methods are declared static if you have to call them in the main method. Also I have noticed that in order to call a static method from another class you do not need to create an object of that you can use the class name.

What are the advantages of declaring static variables and methods?

When should I declare static variable and methods?

Imagine that a class is the equivalent of a blue-print for a house. Image then that a house is to the blueprint as an instance of the class is for the class. You can have one class (blue-print) and multiple instances (houses) created from it.

Now common sense dictates that most of the functions/behaviors that a house (instance) can have/do, even though they are declared in the blue-print, cannot be used until an actual house (instance) is made out of that blue-print (class). Like, your blue print might contain in it the place where the light switches and the light bulbs should go, but you have no way of making those work on the blue-print, you have to actually build the house in order to be able to switch the light switch on and off and have certain light bulbs go on and off.

However, you might have some behavior that is applicable to the blue-print directly, and which you could use/access directly on the blue print without needing to make an actual house out of that blue print. Imagine that your blue-print has a button that, upon pressing, will display the footprint of the house contained in that blue print (by calculating all the lengths of the walls and such). Obviously you COULD build a house first, then go around measuring its footprint, but you can do this with he blue-print alone, so it would be more helpful to have this behavior implemented in the blue-print.

129,129,204,What is the best way for a user to select an item by unique identifier?,"My team and I are building a mobile app where the user will need to input a human-readable unique identifier (the serial number) of a single unit of inventory. Our system tracks the serial numbers that the user can access. We have considered three possible input modes:

1. We show the user the entire list of serial numbers they can access and allow him to select one from the list (like how a select element would work on an HTML page).

Pros:


The user doesn't have to type anything in.
The user can't enter an invalid serial number.


Cons:


The list is likely to be overwhelmingly large.
The serial numbers usually have the same format and are often sequential, so it might be hard to read the list.
Data usage for downloading the entire list of serial numbers


2. We allow the user to start entering the serial number in a text input and have an auto-suggest drop-down with a filtered list of serial numbers the user can access.

Pros:


The user doesn't have to type in a complete serial number.
The user is unlikely to enter an invalid serial number.
Smaller list to choose from than Option 1.


Cons:


The serial numbers usually have the same format and are often sequential, so it might be hard to read the list.
Auto-suggest may have limited value since the unit has a barcode that we could read.
Data usage for downloading a sizable list of serial numbers


3. We require the entire serial number to be entered, and once we recognize the correct number of characters, we validate the serial number against the user's accessible list and show feedback.

Pros:


The unit has a barcode that we could read, so this has the potential to be simpler than an auto-suggest or select-from-list paradigm.
Simpler implementation
Significantly reduced data usage vs. Option 1 and Option 2


Cons:


The unit has multiple barcodes, so it might take a couple of tries for the user to capture the correct one.
Typing manually would be tedious if the camera is unavailable or barcode scanner isn't working for whatever reason (lighting, etc.)


Which of these three is the best approach? Is there a better approach than what we have considered?
",Nick Saunders,https://ux.stackexchange.com/users/50391,"We provide retail and stock control systems so accurate capture of barcodes and serial numbers at high speed is important to us. For what its worth, here's what we do, but our target market might be slightly different to yours.

Use a barcode scanner. There are bluetooth ones that interface easily to most mobile devices. Of course this costs the end user money so might not be an option.

Allow use of camera to capture barcode and/or OCR. Not that hard programming wise but is not actually that fast overall. Good for consumers but not a receiving dock. (Nb quality of cameras varies by device, so this does not work for all devices) Despite some drawbacks for high volume use, cameras do allow us to keep a photo as proof of entry forever, which is useful.

If keyboard entry is required, we present a text box input and display a series of tiles with valid options that can be pressed.  The list of tiles changes dynamically on every keystroke. We find the tiles are better than a classic drop list as (a) bigger and easier to press (b) let us display a bit more info such as description (c) have more options to colour code the background as a signal too.

Personally I would not just display a list of barcodes, try and display something else to help the user. As DaveAlger says in his answer barcodes and serial numbers aren't designed for humans. Display a product description, date it was first seen, anything.

For barcodes, the most useful parts are generally the first and last few characters. We allow users to enter any characters they can see in the barcode, skipping whatever they wish. They just cannot jumble the order.  If you are using sql, and my input is ""9412"" then the query is something like 

 Select ... From barcodes where barcode like '%9%4%1%2%'


Rather than the typically used

 Select ... From barcodes where barcode like '9412%'


Once users learn this, and it isn't obvious I admit, they really appreciate it.  Try reading 94100000000192 and entering it correctly. This technique means I can just enter 941192 and picklist will show it.

(Actually, we use both the above sql queries with the second sql doing the first half the results and the other doing all remaining gaps. This is to ensure the order looks right to users, but the second sql quickly resolves to no records as users enter more characters.)

We put a lot of effort into making the pick list tiles as relevant as possible, eg if you just used supplier #1, then barcodes from supplier number #1 have higher priority. Not sure this will be possible for you, but sometimes it is.  Imagine you are entering serial numbers of watches. After the user has entered ""9412"", you may know that the only brands possible (with 9412) are Seiko and Swatch, so two buttons appear on the pick list to select these as an additional filter if the user wishes. Lots of work to make this seemless, but for us 1/4 second and less friction from user entry is worth the effort.

1117,1117,1754,What's the best way to generate an NPC's face using web technologies?,"I'm in the process of creating a web app. I have many randomly-generated non-player characters in a database. I can pull a lot of information about them - their height, weight, down to eye color, hair color, and hair style.

For this, I am solely interested in generating a graphical representation of the face. Currently the information is displayed with text in the nicest way possible, but I believe it's worth generating these faces for a more... human experience.

Problem is, I don't know where to start. Were it 2007, I'd naturally think to myself that using Flash would be the best choice. I'd love to see ""breathing"" simulated. However, since Flash is on its way out, I'm not sure of a solid solution.

With a previous game, I simply used layered .PNGs to represent various aspects of the player's body: their armor, the face, the skin color. However, these solutions weren't very dynamic and felt very amateur. I can't go deep into this project feeling like that's an inferior way to present these faces, and I'm certain there's a better way.

Can anyone give some suggestion on how to pull this off well?
",Vael Victus,https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/users/6056,"The way you are thinking to do it is fine.  You should drop inhibitions about Flash and just use it.

Just a note that the best face generator I've ever come across is facegen.

There is a FaceGen SDK.  I don't really know what it costs, but I'm guessing it must be in the thousands.  Then, you have FaceGen create a face, using your inputted parameters (for eyes spacing, skin color etc - FaceGen can do all that).  Then, you render the face to a texture, save it out, and send it over to the other application.

1770,1770,2812,Change of basis in non-linear Schrodinger equation,"At the mean-field level, the dynamics of a polariton condensate can be described by a type of nonlinear Schrodinger equation (Gross-Pitaevskii-type), for a classical (complex-number) wavefunction $\psi_{LP}$. Its form in momentum space reads:

\begin{multline}
i \frac{d}{dt}\psi_{LP}(k) =\left[\epsilon(k) 
-i\frac{\gamma(k)}{2}\right] \psi_{LP}(k) 
+F_{p}(k)\,\, e^{-i\omega_{p}t}  \\
+  \sum_{q_1,q_2} g_{k,q_1,q_2}\, \psi^{\star}_{LP}(q_1+q_2-k)
\, \psi_{LP}(q_1)\, \psi_{LP}(q_2).
\end{multline}

The function $\epsilon(k)$ is the dispersion of the particles (polaritons). The polaritons are a non-equilibrium system, due to their finite lifetime (damping rate $\gamma$). Therefore, they need continuous pumping with amplitude $F_p$ at energy $\omega_p$.
Finally, there exists a momentum-dependent nonlinear interaction $g_{k,q_1,q_2}$ that depends of the so-called Hopfield coefficients $X$ (simple functions of momentum) as:

\begin{equation}
g_{k,q_1,q_2}=g\, X^{\star}(k)\, X^{\star}(q_1+q_2-k)\, X(q_1)\, X(q_2)
\end{equation}

How can one transform the equation for $\psi$ to real-space?

Maybe you can also see this way that the structure is determined by momentum conservation/translation invariance. Now when I integrate this by $\int\!dk\,e^{ikr}$, the $k$ integral is resolved trivially and I'm left with fourier transforms over the $q$s.

$$\int dr_{123}\,\tilde{g}(r-r_1,r-r_2,r-r_3)\tilde{\psi}^*\!(r_1)\tilde{\psi}(r_2)\tilde{\psi}(r_3)$$

Which is more or less the most general third order nonlinear term you can write. In your case you can also reduce this further by using the real space transforms of $X$, either by plugging in directly to the first equation I wrote, or by calculating $\tilde{g}$ and plugging into the second.

482,482,750,Power loss from an inductive load,"A problem reads ""A single phase 50 Hz generator supplies an inductive load of 5000 kW at a power factor of 0.707 lagging ... ""
How can there be real power loss from an inductor? 
",Let It Be,https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/10245,"With a 5 GigaWatt generation of power, caused by heavy industry with motor driven inductive loads it raises the reactive current which doesn't get counted as ""real"" power consumption but is a cost to the provider, as it reduces the capacity limited by current in distribution losses. Motors have inductance but do work (consume real power) and have losses and dissipate heat from many causes, such as winding resistance.

To resolve this, switchable capacitor banks are manually or automatically adjusted near the sub-stations to raise the power factor and reduce the peak current back to the source. They select +VARS of phase leading current from banks to offset some of the -VARS from the loads to reduce distribution losses and improve capacity for real power to be sold.

So even though as consumers we are measured by real power, with all our fridge and air condition motors running, power providers need to raise the power factor when additional capacity is required or to reduce the distribution losses which can be as much as 10% in cable resistive loss. But in large hydro power stations this is still the most efficient power source.




the above answer was intended to offer a bigger picture of what power factor means to a 5GW power station. We obviously are not dealing with just inductors here but in general ""inductive loads"". Inductive Power factor is different from power Factor caused the growing issues of SMPS effects of current pulses before peak voltage.

2443,2443,3900,Do delegates defy OOP,"I'm trying to understand OOP so I can write better OOP code and one thing which keeps coming up is this concept of a delegate (using .NET). I could have an object, which is totally self contained (encapsulated); it knows nothing of the outside world... but then I attach a delegate to it. 

In my head, this is still quite well separated as the delegate only knows what to reference, but this by itself means it has to know about something else outside it's world! That a method exists within another class!

Have I got myself it total muddle here, or is this a grey area, or is this actually down to interpretation (and if so, sorry as that will be off topic I'm sure). My question is, do delegates defy/muddy the OOP pattern?

This is because the responsibility of the write operation of the FileStream is purely upon FileStream if we're following OOP to the letter.

However, this doesn't mean that using delegates always goes against OOP.  Using the same example, if I used a delegate to handle events before and after writes, this is still following OOP because it is not the responsibility of FileStream to know what should happen before and after writes.  It should merely notify the classes which are responsible.

2184,2184,3477,Why can't a Sefer Torah be written in Aramaic?,"
  In the Mishna, Megillah 1:8, Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel is quoted as having said that Greek is the only language, other than Hebrew, in which it is permissible to write sifrei Torah. Commenting on this, the Jerusalem Talmud (Megillah 71c) says that the sages checked and discovered that Greek is the only language into which it is possible to translate the Torah with its exact meaning.


Source: an answer to Translation to Greek

But why not Aramaic? I remember reading somewhere that it had ""sparks"" of holiness, the proof being that it is the language of the Gemara. It's also linguistically more similar to Hebrew than Greek, so it should be possible to get a good translation.
",Scimonster,https://judaism.stackexchange.com/users/5151,"Your question appears to be asking why it would not be kosher to use an Aramaic Torah scroll in lieu of a Hebrew one.  You may want to reword your question.  Throughout Jewish history and up until the present, Aramaic targumim have been recited in the synagogue alongside the traditional Hebrew Torah.  Currently the Jews of Yemen read from Targum Onkelos during the Torah reading.  However, the practice of solely reading from a scroll written in a language other than Hebrew, such as Aramaic or Greek, was never common practice.  There are many reasons for this, a few of which are given below.


The Talmud [Sotah 33] discusses praying in Aramaic instead of Hebrew and states that the angels do not understand Aramaic.  The message here is that Hebrew is preferable over Aramaic since it allows the person reciting it to have a closer connection to heaven.
This notion is further reinforced by the practice שנים מקרא ואחד תרגום [Berakhot 8a].  This is referring to the practice of twice reading the weekly Torah portion in Hebrew with the congregation, while reading once from the Targum.

906,906,1438,How does Charlie deduce Myra is Mrs Kieslowski?,"In Seven Psychopaths Charlie (Woody Harrelson) comes to the hospital to find Mrs Kieslowski. He finds a patient- who we know is Myra Kieslowski- but wrongly assumes that because she is black it cannot be her. He then tells her how he is looking for Mrs Kieslowski because her husband has stolen his dog.

In the course of the subsequent conversation, he comes to realise that she is the woman he's looking for. But I can't understand how.

Here's the discussion between Charlie and Moyra.


  Myra: I'm sure Mr. Kieslowski will take good care of your dog and get
  it back to you safe. He always seems like a sweet man when he comes
  in.
  
  Charlie: He come visit her a lot?

How did Charlie deduce this, from the conversation? 

Was it just the fact that Myra seemed too eager to convince him that Charlie had already missed Mr Kieslowski's visit and was wasting his time waiting? In which case, why did she say he visited every day?

3738,3738,5955,"Good travel games for two players, especially for playing on trains?","I would be interested to hear if anyone had recommendations for 2-player games that are particularly suitable for playing while travelling on trains.  (I ask this as someone who mostly enjoys games like Carcassonne, Power Grid, Agricola, Pandemic, etc. around the table at home.)  To be specific, the things that I think are important properties for these games are:


Needing minimal table space.  Most trains have a small table you could use, but not much more.
Being quiet to play, so that other passengers won't be disturbed.  For example, I imagine that games that involve repeatedly rolling dice wouldn't be appreciated.
Packing down small, so that they don't take up much luggage space.
Not requiring batteries or a power socket.  (I appreciate that an iPhone or a Nintendo DS for each player might be a good solution more generally, but it's not what I'm after in this case.)
Not being so delicate to arrange that motion from the train will unduly disrupt the play.


I think it would be best to recommend one game (or class of games) per answer, if that's appropriate, and explain why you think it's particularly suitable.  (Incidentally, I've read the guidance on good questions about game recommendations and hope this question meets the criteria.)

Update: Thanks for so many excellent suggestions - we certainly won't be short of games for our next long train journey :)

Update 2: Unfortunately, I can't really playtest this many great games in any reasonable time period, so I'm going to accept the top-voted answer (Cribbage) and try out the others as soon as I can.  Thanks again...

5896,5896,9341,Understanding the static keyword,"I have some experience in developing with Java, Javascript and PHP.

I am reading Microsoft Visual C# 2010 Step by Step which I feel it is a very good book on introducing you to the C# language.

I seem to be having problems in understanding the static keyword. From what I understand this far if a class is declared static all methods and variable have to be static. The main method always is a static method so in the class that the main method exists all variables and methods are declared static if you have to call them in the main method. Also I have noticed that in order to call a static method from another class you do not need to create an object of that you can use the class name.

What are the advantages of declaring static variables and methods?

When should I declare static variable and methods?
",Nistor Alexandru,https://programmers.stackexchange.com/users/52164,"Looking at it this way helps me:


Every type has a static instance.
The static instance is created at the first time you access the type -- either through the static instance or creating another instance.
You can create as many non-static instances as you like, but there is only one static instance.
Anything within a class that is declared as static belongs to the static instance, and thus doesn't have access to any other instances you create. But the other instances DO have access to the static instance.
If a class is declared as static then you cannot create other instances, only the static instance can ever exist.
You can declare a static constructor for the static instance just like a constructor for a normal instance (but by declaring it static).


As for when to use the static keyword:


Any method that doesn't need access to local properties can and probably should be declared static.
Helper classes that don't have any state whatsoever (which should be rare anyway) and that will never be mocked can be declared static. Whether they should is another matter; use this functionality sparingly.
Properties and fields that must be accessed by all instances of a class must be declared static. But use this only when there is no other option.

I tried to play with z-index but it doesn't work. I took over someone else's work and CSS file is messy, and the website calls several stylesheets. In any case, the stylesheet I'm working with is here: http://dev.gratefulhearttherapy.org/index.php/tools/css/themes/gratefulheart/typography-new2.css

2259,2259,3601,How to fix a Macbook Pro trackpad where the mouse pointer is randomly moving?,"The trackpad on my Macbook Pro just started acting oddly. It's randomly clicking (which might cause me to switch programs), right-clicking and even once my screen even showed the swiping animation as if I was trying to switch to a different desktop.    

Part of me fears that this is some sort of joke hacking attempt (I know of a USB device you plug into someones computer and it randomly moves their mouse and types on their keyboard), but there is nothing plugged into my machine and I just turned off the Wi-Fi and watched as this web page tried to close, the mouse right clicked twice, highlighted a word and clicked ""Paste and Match Style"" in the Chrome right-click menu.
Also as I've been typing (with my Wi-Fi turned off) the mouse has randomly been clicking inside this question and changing where I am typing.  

I just plugged in a USB mouse which seems to work fine but the trackpad is now nearly useless. I can't even move the mouse cursor more than a few centimeters with it.

Is this a common issue?
EDIT
I think it is dying actually. I can now click but not move at all with the trackpad, while a regular mouse works fine.
EDIT 2
And now it seems to be working again. I turned on the option for ""Ignore Trackpad when Mouse is plugged in"" under Universal Access. I cleaned the trackpad with rubbing alcohol, I whined and complained for a few minutes to my dog, turned off the ""Ignore Trackpad"" setting, unplugged the USB mouse, and the Trackpad appears to be working mostly normally.
If I run my finger across it at the top or bottom portion of the mouse, it works, but there is a line horizontally across it (almost exactly where a physical trackpad button would end on the old trackpads) that is ""dead"".

  For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life. (John 3:16)

If so, isn't double meaning in Greek? At least in Czech, English and German you could use the phrase ""he died for humans' sins"" in sense of ""because of"" - like cause of his death was humans' fault - fault of the Romans who crucified him.

(btw I think I understand the evangelical message so I'm not asking how christians get it today, so please don't make your interpretations of the direct Jesus' quote much distant)

",Steg Verner,https://stackoverflow.com/users/4360034,"There's an underused STL algorithm called remove_if that allows you to efficiently (O(n)) remove all elements matching a predicate from a container. It is most useful if you have a vector or deque, because they have an expensive (O(n)) erase operation for an element ""in the middle"". However, you need to be aware that remove_if doesn't actually erase any element, it only moves all elements that do not match the predicate to the front of the range you specified. The canonical way to do an ""erase_if"" is therefore (in this example, all odd integers will be erased):


std::vector ints = …;
ints.erase(std::remove_if(begin(ints), end(ints), [](int i) { return i%2 != 0; }), end(ints));


Explanation: remove_if moves all ints not matching the predicate (i.e. the even ints in this example) to the front and returns an iterator one past the last of these elements. Then, we actually erase all elements starting with this one to the end of the vector using the range overload of vector&lt;int&gt;::erase.

E.g., assume we have ints == {5,7,4,10,9,16,20,6}. remove_if will turn ints into {4,10,16,20,6,UNSPEC,UNSPEC,UNSPEC} where I used UNSPEC to denote any unspecified value, and it will also return an iterator pointing to the first UNSPEC element. Then, we erase all the elements with unspecified value and get {4,10,16,20,6}, the desired result.

UPDATE: With respect to the previous answer, I want to point out that remove_if is stable, i.e. it will not change the order of the remaining elements.

I can hear a melody in my head, but even if I try to hit the first note, I will fail very often. Now what I want to ask is, can anyone learn to sing in a manner that ""won't hurt the ear of a non-musician""? I'm not asking if anyone could be the next Freddie Mercury, but does anyone have the ability to sing some backing vocals if needed, without just sounding terrible?

I always find it hard to get question on music get to the point, so i'll try it with this: Can anyone achieve semi-professional level of singing, even if one doesn't have a ""good"" voice?
",Michael Kunst,https://music.stackexchange.com/users/7091,"ABSOLUTELY! I'm very enthusiastic about this question, which I hope is conveyed by my use of exclamation marks. The reason being is because I can personally relate to this question.

I have always wanted to learn to sing since I learned to play guitar. I was very reluctant at first and very terrible. I was put down a lot by people telling me to stop singing or stop trying (including my loving mother), but alas I pressed on because I enjoyed it even if I was terrible.

I want to give you a few tips to learn to sing because I wish I had these tips when I was learning. I learned all on my own, and that's why I know anybody can.


First things first, the best piece of advice I can give you is to buy a good computer mic like the Yeti Silver (that's what I use) and it's currently at a big discount right now from Amazon. Then get a good pair of over-ear headphones. Connect your mic to your computer, and connect your head phones to your mic. Put em on and start singing. This is good because now you can hear yourself instantly how other people hear you and it lets you adjust your voice right away instead of recording and waiting to play the record back until you can hear yourself. Trust me there is a huge difference--while we can hear our own voices well enough to get the basics, it is a world of difference to hear yourself with a microphone.
Learn to accept that your voice has certain qualities that make it different from other voices. When I started I always tried singing with a sort of whispery head voice because I didn't like how my natural voice sounded and thought it to be aweful. The truth is, all of your voices (every part of your vocal system) can sound great with training. This includes falsetto which will sound bad until you practice and smooth it out. Actually I recently posed a question asking if I could make my falsetto like Brian Mcknight and I found out for myself not too long after because I was practicing it a lot. Check it out here.
Practice singing scales. It's good that you can play guitar because it gives you the advantage of having a musical ear over someone who doesn't play anything. Also it gives you something to guide your voice with. You know when you're tuning your strings to each other without a tuner--ie hit the sixth string on the fifth fret and make it so it sounds like the fifth string. Well you can hear when it's out of tune or not, so all you have to do is practice singing say a C scale. Sing it and when your voice is off fix it until it matches then go up and down. Practice the vocal dexterity of switching notes. I'll tab the C scale for you for convenience. At the bottom is the C scale tabbed for guitar.
Use Youtube to find vocal practice lessons. This is good to give you new ways of practicing your vocals. There's a lot more to singing that just being in tune, and you'll find that out as you sing more. Of course this can get kind of boring, but it's good to explore.
Pay attention to good singers. When you hear a good singer, pay attention to their vocals and what they are doing and how it sounds. The more I learned to sing, the more I could distinguish between different kinds of voices. (When I say voices, I'm referring to head, chest, and falsetto etc.) It's like when you can already play guitar and you hear a guitar song, you can pick out a lot more parts because you already speak the guitar langauge--bow chika wow wow. Did you just hear the wawaw pedal there? :)
ENJOY IT! Screw what anybody tells you about singing. You are your own person and if you want to be good at something or learn something you need to practice. When you start learning you're not gonna be good, but you need to have the conviction to keep it up and put other people's thoughts and comments out of your mind. One day you're gonna be good and they will eat their words. I was put down a lot when I was learning, but I kept learning because I wanted so bad to be good and I enjoyed it. Also, it helps to have a quiet place where you can practice to slowly gain confidence before you're practicing around other people. 


Hope this helps. Good luck and keep practicing.

260,260,422,Effects of nuclear explosions in space?,"In the Honor Harrington universe, ship-to-ship combat takes two forms: missiles and direct energy weapons.

Missiles come in two forms - bomb-pumped lasers and contact nukes.  Both use multi-megaton nuclear initiations to damage enemy ships.

While this sort of event on a planetary surface will obviously have lasting effects, what long-term effects could be expected in a vacuum environment, aside from the destructive force associated with the explosions themselves, and the resulting EMP?  Especially, would there be lingering (or spreading) radiation?
",Jeff,https://scifi.stackexchange.com/users/656,"In space, you'd expect much the same effect from blast, radiation, and heat as in atmosphere.

Of course, with no atmosphere to ""carry"" the blast effect, it's going to be greatly limited.
There will be little or no effect from what you might call ""shrapnel""... The bomb itself is going to be vaporized and you're not going to get chunks of stuff flying around at high velocity.
Both we and the Russians experimented with the effects of nuclear weapons in space, if you get a chance there's a documentary on Netflix about the development of the hydrogen bomb.

1955,1955,3114,Caucasus: end overland trip where I started without retracing my steps,"I'm looking into a Caucasus trip visiting Turkey, Georgia and Armenia. A return flight from IST is far cheaper than a multi-city flight, so I'd like to get back to Istanbul without going over the same route I came in (through Georgia, which as I understand seems to be the only way to get to Armenia from Turkey)

Given local neighbour relations, what path can I take that includes all three but doesn't repeat any part of the journey ?

To return from Armenia, I see two equally unreliable options: 


Getting an Azerbaijan transit visa and crossing Naxchivan, but the Armenia-Azerbaijan border is apparently closed, and I'm afraid an Armenian stamp in my passport could complicate this passage. The Armenia-Azerbaijan border is closed, so that settles this issue.
Getting an Iranian visa in Georgia then boarding the Tehran-Istanbul train. This is risky as Canadian-Iranian relations aren't super right now, I've heard of people being denied visas.

One component of site is blog posts and pages, sitemap for which gets built by sitemap plugin every night. 

Another component is the college pages and we went live with this section 2 month back. To build the sitemap for these 8000+ pages , we wrote a program and created a sitemap lets say abc.xml.
Then we submitted the sitemap to google.

After 2 months, I can see that the google acknowledged the submission but never indexed these 8000+ pages.

561 indexed pages are from our blog post and pages.



I guess the mistakes we did was that we created the sitemap of 8000+ links and submitted when we should have done it in piecemeal basis.
2nd mistake I guess is that we do not update the abc.xml sitemap regularly which we thought of doing once all the pages were indexed.

",vsingh,https://webmasters.stackexchange.com/users/1414,"To answer your question very specifically. Google prefers to index smaller sites and submitting a sitemap, while advisable for a site your size, may actually go largely ignored. Yes Google has read it.

One site I submitted a sitemap for was fully indexed while the sitemap was hardly touched according to Google Webmaster Tools. This should not be a concern.

As well, any site can really take a while to get indexed especially any new site.

So, here is short list of circuit duals:


  Voltage - Current
  
  Resistance - Conductance
  
  Inductance - Capacitance
  
  Impedance - Admittance
  
  Series - Parallel
  
  Thevenin - Norton


There are others but these will do most of the time.

Ohm's law is usually written as:

\$V = I R \$

To take the dual, replace all the variables in the above equation with their duals:

The dual of Ohm's Law:

\$I = VG \$

where \$G = \dfrac{1}{R} \$

Recall that for resistors in series, resistances add, so that the equivalent resistance is just the sum.

Consider the dual of this, conductances in parallel.

From the principle of duality, parallel conductances add just as series resistances.  So, if you have 3 conductances in parallel, the equivalent conductance is:

\$G_{eq} = G_1 + G_2 + G_3 \$

Now, convert back to resistance:

\$R_{eq} = \dfrac{1}{G_{eq}} = \dfrac{1}{G_1 + G_2 + G_3} = \dfrac{1}{\frac{1}{R_1}+\frac{1}{R_2} +\frac{1}{R_3}}\$

In other words, the equivalent resistance of \$n\$ parallel resistors is the reciprocal of the sum of the reciprocals.

This is the origin of your first formula.

What it's doing is adding a filter on the_title that doesn't accept any parameters.  That's your first mistake.  The the_title filter actually takes two parameters - the page/post title and the page/post id.  So first, let's rewrite our hook:

add_filter( 'the_title', 'remove_page_title', 10, 2 );
function remove_page_title( $title, $id ) {

}


This assigns our filter with a priority of 10 and lets us accept both parameters sent in by the filter.  Then we specify the parameters our function accepts.

Inside the function, we want to check if we're on the right page.  If we are, return '', if we aren't return the title:

if( '138' == $id ) return '';

return $title;


Your original function was always returning '' when the filter ran.  That's why you were getting a blank title on every page, not just the page you wanted.

  Possible Duplicate:
  Why avoid increment (&ldquo;++&rdquo;) and decrement (&ldquo;--&rdquo;) operators in JavaScript?  




I'm a big fan of Douglas Crockford and his excellent book, JavaScript: The Good Parts. I also use his JSLint tool on an hourly basis before checking in any code to our repository, as is good sense.

One thing I've noticed when running code through JSLint is its insistence that the ++ increment operator is somehow evil. I know I can turn certain rules off, but that's cheating ;). Crockford mentions his dislike on page 112 of JS: TGP...


  In my own practice, I observed that when I used ++ and --, my code tended to be too tight, too tricky, too cryptic. So, as a matter of discipline, I don't use them any more. I think that as a result, my coding style has become cleaner.


That's all very lovely, but he doesn't give any examples of the way he codes them now. I assume he's doing something like...

var i;
i = 0;
i = i + 1;


Again, great, but I've got a few basic 'for loops' in my JS code, as I imagine many people have, and I've always used the standard syntax...

for (i = 0; i &lt; myArray.length; i++) { 
    // Loop Stuff 
}


Am I missing something? What's the cleanest and/or best way to increment/decrement?

1899,1899,3023,Where to create a shared media folder?,"I'd like to place all my family's media in one shared folder for everyone to use from any computer.  Whether it's a PC or home server.

What is more appropriate:


Create it in my home folder (/home/lamcro/media/)
Create a new account called media (/home/media/)
or just Create a new folder  (/media/)


As far as I know, there is no ""Shared Folder"" in Ubuntu, like in Windows.

I'm just looking for the least cumbersome method, in case I ever want to do a full Linux re-install.
",lamcro,https://superuser.com/users/1237,"/media: Not such a good idea. You should find an existing folder in that location. This is where Ubuntu auto-mounts any external media. You'll find new folders mysteriously springing up within your share when you plug in some media e.g an external USB drive. You could instead place your files within a folder in /media, e.g /media/Lamcro-Media. 

/home/lamcro/media: A so-so choice. Chances of accidental deletion of a folder are high when they are in your home directory. You do not want to lose your photos and home videos due to an accidental click or a command that didn't go as planned.

/home/media: You could do this, if the new user 'media' will own all the files. If not, it'd be just a location, albeit one tied to a user account. I'd avoid this, just  because I don't get the logic behind a userid for my media.

My suggestion would be to create a new partition, mount it within /media, e.g. /media/Lamcro-Media and then place your files there. If you ever had to reinstall linux, you would be able to leave this partition untouched, and mount it again on the newly installed system. Failing that, I'd opt for /media/Lamcro-Media as a normal folder, but that's just personal choice.

Going by your question, I'd say the key is to create a new partition to keep all your media. You could then mount it at /media and, if dissatisfied, remount it elsewhere.

3636,3636,5804,"Relationship between user story, feature, and epic?","As someone whose still new to agile, I'm not sure I completely understand the relationship or difference between a user story, feature, and epic.

According to this question, a feature is a collection of stories.  One of the answers suggest that a feature is actually an epic.  

So are features and epics considered the same thing, which is basically a collection of related user stories?

Our project manager insists that there's a hierarchical structure:

Epic -> Features -> User stories

... basically all user stories must fall within this structure.  Therefore all user stories must fall under an umbrella feature and all features must fall under an epic.

To me, that sounds awkward.  Can someone please clarify how user stories, features, and epics are related?  Or is there an article that clearly outlines the differences?
",nivlam,https://programmers.stackexchange.com/users/45,"I agree like many responses that there are really no right answers since these are just terms which can be varied depending on which Agile camp you are based on and you can definitely make up your own camp as long as everyone in your team including the external stakeholders understand what they mean.

The answer I like is from Mike Cohn's camp and it is fairly simple.

http://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/blog/stories-epics-and-themes


Epic is just a big Story (hierarchical)
Theme is just a group of Stories (pretty much like tag)


He actually avoids the term ""Feature"". I assume that it is mainly because it was a common term in the traditional waterfall world. Many Agile camp tends to use different terms to emphasize the differences.

It is just a way of organizing your requirement.

The answer I like is from Mike Cohn's camp and it is fairly simple.

http://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/blog/stories-epics-and-themes


Epic is just a big Story (hierarchical)
Theme is just a group of Stories (pretty much like tag)


He actually avoids the term ""Feature"". I assume that it is mainly because it was a common term in the traditional waterfall world. Many Agile camp tends to use different terms to emphasize the differences.

This has a number of us confused. If we had a VPN setup, it wouldn't show up as being routed across the internet. If it hit an internet server, Private IP's (such as 192.168) shouldn't get routed.

What would let a private IP address get routed across servers? would the fact that it's all comcast mean that they have their routers setup wrong?

Set up wrong? Yes, private addressing should absolutely be filtered within the interior of their network. But if they've been a bit sloppy then it's possible if the path is all Comcast- in carrier networks, especially sloppy ones like Comcast, private addressing is filtered at the edge networking diligently, but not nearly as much at the core or access portions. In your case it appears that the entire route is Comcast-only, so it is 'reasonable' that this might actually be forwarded to a destination also within Comcast that actually answers for it. It isn't a clean networking implementation, to be sure, and you did go from the Baltimore area to Denver and finally to Georgia, but it is possible within a complete ""autonomous system"" that allows for it.

4716,4716,7482,What are lightbox / modal window UI best practices for viewing full-sized images in a gallery?,"I'm an artist and amateur web designer.

On my portfolio website, I've grouped my work into projects. Most of my projects contain few (20 or less) images, so I just display them in full size and let the visitor scroll (example) because this is how I prefer to browse other artist's work as well.

For projects containing more images, I use thumbnails which link to the full-sized images, because, again, when I browse other artist's portfolios, if there are lots of images on a page it's kinda cumbersome to load. 

Recently I wrote some jQuery to implement a lightbox effect (modal window overlay) so when you click on a thumbnail, the full-sized image appears (example).

My main reasons for implementing this:


it's much more presentable than having a direct link to the image,
which is what I used to do
if the visitor shares the image on something like tumblr or
Pinterest, the link back will be to the project page instead of a
direct link to the image
if the visitor wants to right-click on the thumbnails to load several
images in several new browser tabs/windows, they can still do so (the
lightbox is triggered on left click)


I did not include a close button because it seems like more work for the visitor to have to look for a close button, than to simply click anywhere to close the lightbox (which is what I did).

What are your thoughts regarding lightbox interface for this particular use?
The goal would be the best way to showcase visual art/design work, and the target audience would be, well, anyone who wants to view the work. The display method, in this case a lightbox interface, should be efficient, useable, and presentable (it should highlight, not detract from, the work).

1056,1056,1660,Why is it not dangerous to dissolve NaCl?,"$$\ce{H2O~(l) + NaCl~(s) -&gt;[\Delta] Na+~(aq) + Cl^{-}~(aq)}$$

When table salt is placed in water, it dissolves due to the polarity of water molecules. When solvation takes place, negatively polar sides of water molecules attach to $\ce{Na+}$ ions, and positively polar sides of water molecules attach to $\ce{Cl-}$ ions. The ions are then carried away by water molecules through diffusion. Since the sodium is now isolated from the chlorine, what keeps it from violently exploding with water in the following chemical reaction?

$$\ce{2Na + 2H2O -&gt; 2 NaOH + H2}$$

Also, since chlorine is poisonous, wouldn't that make drinking salted water extremely lethal?

1419,1419,2228,Prove that any real function defined on a real open interval has at most countably many simple discontinuities.,"This is problem 17 in baby Rudin's chapter on continuity. He has a hint to use triplets of rationals that bound each simple discontinuity on the left, right, and in between the values of the limits from the left and right. It seems like this can be weakened to just rationals to the left and right. 

Simple discontinuities are those in which the limit from the left and right exist, so there must be intervals to the left and right of a simple continuity on which no other simple discontinuity can exist. More precisely, let $c$ and $c'$ be simple discontinuities for $f$ on $(a,b)$ and consider the limit, $l$, of $f$ approaching $c$ from the left:

$\forall \epsilon &gt;0, \exists \delta&gt;0 : c-x&lt;\delta \Rightarrow |l-f(x)|&lt;\epsilon$

but $ \exists \epsilon '&gt;0 \forall \delta ' &gt;0 : |c'-x|&lt;\delta ' \Rightarrow |f(c')-f(x)|&gt;\epsilon '
\\ \therefore \epsilon = \epsilon ' , \delta ' = \delta \rightarrow \leftarrow
$

Therefore, you can make an injection from the set of simple discontinuities to a subset of rationals by associating each simple discontinuity with one rational in the aforementioned ""free"" interval to its left; from there compose with the map from rationals to integers to show countable. Is this argument correct?

So that 

$$

On different computer builds, ASUS/GIGABYTE/MSI, I constantly have outgoing connections to XXX-XXX-XXX.deploy.static.akamaitechnologies.com over HTTP Port 80, and if the connection attempts are denied, the network card (or at least internet connectivity) stops working... LAN connections still appear to work. The outgoing connections occur on every restart, and must be allowed for the network card to function properly. If the attempts are denied, the system must be restated so that the connections will be attempted again and can be allowed.

This post suggests narrowing down an offending application, but I don't see how akamai technologies can be so intertwined in so many systems, cut-off connectivity if not allowed, etc. Something about it feels like unauthorized (or at least unwanted) information transfer, at the very least a phone-home, but I have no Wirshark captures to confirm this :)

Will it make insurance cheaper to get a driving licence here if I want to rent or buy a car for 4 weeks? I am in possession of a Dutch driving licence.

Also, do they make a distinction between in-state and out-of-state licences when renting a car?
",Patrick,https://travel.stackexchange.com/users/7756,"The exact requirements vary from state to state, but in New York it appears that there is no requirement for you to get a NY Drivers License (as opposed to some other states where once you have been a resident for more than 3 months your home country drivers license is no longer valid).

However on a J1 visa you can optionally get a local drivers license, as long as your visa length is greater than 1 year, AND you have at least 6 months of validity on the visa remaining.

As far as whether it's worth doing this for the purpose of insurance, it depends on what type of insurance you are after.

For rental car insurance, there is no difference in cost of the insurance depending on the type of license you have. If you are getting the insurance from the rental car company (CDP/LDW/etc) then they will not vary it depending on the type of license you have.

Many insurance companies will not offer you insurance if you do not have a US drivers license.

If you do have a US drivers license then you will be able to get coverage, but it will not be cheap.

3216,3216,5131,How does Christianity deal with biblical criticism related to the Old Testament?,"As an orthodox Jew I have seen quite a stir lately regarding the topic of biblical criticism, specifically towards the Old Testament (Torah). 

I have perused several questions in this stack which seem to address this topic in general, and learned a lot about apologetics, but I have not seen answers that address some of the major claims of biblical criticism, especially as it pertains to the Old Testament. 

For example:


The story of Noah and the flood seems to be contradicted by archaeological evidence as well as having been 'borrowed' from earlier flood narratives such as the Gilgamesh story
Many of the portions of the Old Testament seem to be borrowed from earlier near eastern texts such as the Hammurabi code 
The notion that there are multiple authors (documentary hypothesis) of the Old Testament.


In short, how does Christianity deal with some of the major contentions of biblical criticism towards the Old Testament?

",user5796,https://christianity.stackexchange.com/users/5796,"In short, how does Christianity deal with some of the major contentions of biblical criticism towards the Old Testament?

The literalists contend the academic assertions are false (intentionally or otherwise). The accommodationists attempt to find a way to build a compromise usually at the expense of what is written in the Bible.

This is similar to what passes for science these days in regard to evolution. However with literary criticism the flaws are more apparent.

For example, the assertion of multiple authors is often based on the declaration of someone that they have detected a stylistic difference that ""proves"" that the same person could not have written a document attributed to him.

2102,2102,3346,Mechanic says not to use top three/bottom two gears or the chain will throw,"I just bought a BTwin Fit 5, all stock, fresh from the distributor, Decathlon. Took it for light pacing at the store and things seemed OK. About 100 metres out the door, I shift up to the top end of the range, pedalling firmly but not hard, and it promptly throws the chain to the outside.

Returning to the store, the mechanic puts the chain back on, adjusts the tension on the derailleurs and tells me not to use the top three or bottom two gears (i.e., the 3 highest resistance and two lowest resistance shift positions in the drive train's range), or the chain will throw again. I asked why, but unfortunately, I'm a foreigner and don't speak the local language well enough to understand any of his explanation. Please note I definitely did not misunderstand the bit about not using the gears; this was crystal clear. 

Wild speculations on what he may have said about the reasons for this:


Chain tension or play due to the lateral shift between the inner and outer gears of the front and rear cassettes when shifting
Chain length
Something about the derailleurs


Again, there's a substantial language barrier and I have zero confidence in my understanding of what he said about why I shouldn't use those gears.

If you're not familiar with Decathlon, it's a sports department/box/super store. Definitely not a high end or dedicated bike shop. The house mechanic struck me as less than an expert, to put it gently. I've definitely read some reviews online griping about the inability of Decathlon staff to correctly set up the drive trains of new bikes. However, it's important to understand that this quality of expertise is representative of (or better than) that of every shop within an hour's travel.

This advice seems utterly mad to me. What on earth could be the reasoning behind this? What can I do about it? Aside from the obvious of taking it to a better mechanic, as that presents substantial difficulty for me on a number of fronts. The bike shifts without a problem, including before the throw. I did test out every gear during my test ride. I haven't yet experimented with trying to reproduce the problem yet; I'll do so in the next few days most likely.

The bike has a Shimano Sora groupset and Shimano Deore shifters. I'm an experienced rider but no mechanic; I haven't done anything beyond basic maintenance myself. I can provide additional pictures and am game to make relatively minor adjustments, but even just clearly nailing down the issue would be considerably useful.







Additional pictures, shifted to big-big.

+(NSInteger)getInteger {
    int temp;

}
+(NSString *)getString {
    char input[256];
    scanf(""%s"", input);
    return [NSString stringWithUTF8String:input];
}

@end


So my questions are:


In the PSInputHandler.m class, I wasn't so sure about how to get input from the command line. I read that fgets() is a potential alternative to scanf(), but is there any reason for me to use one over the other?
The method in PSBoard.m that checks for a winner, checkForWinner, is very long. Is there a simplified design I can use to shorten it?
I struggled to name the playerUp method, which returns the player whose turn it is. Is there a more suitable name?
When the user inputs which row and column to place an X or O in, I made it so that the coordinates they enter are from 1 to the number of rows and not 0 to the number of rows minus one (like with zero-based array indexing). Is this more user-friendly, or should I change it to zero-based indexing?
In PSPlayer.m, I use nested ternary operators. Is this too hard to understand? Should I change it to if statements?

When getting the user's input for how many rows and columns to use, which I expect to be an integer, how can I sanitize the input so that the program doesn't crash when a string (for example) is inputted?



Any other critique welcome!
",pasawaya,https://codereview.stackexchange.com/users/24129,"I will update this post over the weekend as I go through your question more and come up with some examples to iterate over my points, but I thought for now, I'd answer some of the easier questions.



Question 1.

I'm not sure and cannot remember (I will try to find out).  At the end of the day, you might consider implementing this with a GUI.  If you're using Xcode, it's quite easy to develop a GUI for either OSX or iOS, and most of your logic is already in place.  You'd just have to write the logic to hook the GUI up to the business logic.



Question 2.

One immediate thought on speeding up this process would be to use a flag to mark whether or not a row/column is a potential winner.  AND, if you do find a row that's a winner, immediately return the winner.

For a row to be a winner, every piece in the row must belong to the same player, correct?  So set the owner of the piece in the first box, and check every box.  As soon as you get to a box that doesn't match the first box, break;.  You don't need to check any more boxes in that row/column/diagonal.  You can move to the next row/column/diagonal.  And if you get to the end of the inner loop and haven't had to break; because you've found the winner, then you can set the winner and return; and stop checking.  

So basically, refactor into something more like this:

for(NSUInteger row = 0; row &lt; self.rows; row++) {

    PSPlayer *playerInFirstColumn = [self playerAtRow:row column:0];
    BOOL winnerFound;

    for(NSUInteger column = 0; column &lt; self.columns; column++) {
        if(![[self playerAtRow:row column:column] isEqualTo:playerInFirstColumn]) {
            winnerFound = false;
            break;
        } else {
            winnerFound = true;
        }
    }

    if (winnerFound) {
        self.winner = playerInFirstColumn;
        return;
    }
}


This will improve performance some.  You can probably still do better, but this is still a drastic improvement, especially for exceptionally large boards.

Now... the BEST performance improvement I can think of would actually mean you're running this check after every turn (which you're already doing, right?).  In this case, you only need to check ONE row, ONE column, and ZERO, ONE, or TWO diagonals.  And this would be a massive performance boost.  You only need to check a the row the piece was played in, the column the piece was played in, and the diagonal the piece was played in.  Every other row, column, and diagonal has been checked on a previous turn and a winner was not found otherwise the game would be over and we wouldn't've had this turn. 

AND, even if we modified the rules to continue playing after a winner has been found, you can just use an array to keep track of each row and column and diagonal and who won that row/column/diagonal, and still only need to check the relevant rows (and only check them for the player who played the piece).



Question 3.

playerUp is probably an alright method name.  Maybe activePlayer?  If you feel it's not descriptive enough, don't hesitate to leave a comment explaining it.  // returns the player whose turn it is



Question 4.

As a programmer, I am used to 0-based indexing systems, but your assumption is correct.  Most people who use programs aren't programs and would be more comfortable with a 1-based coordinate system.  Though... back to question 1... if this were given a GUI, it wouldn't matter.  ;)



Question 5.

Personally, I hate the ternary operators and never use them.  Whether or not they're acceptable would depend largely on who you're working with though.  In this case, it's a simple one.  Again, personally, I hate them and I wouldn't use it, because I never use it, but this one is simple enough that if you and everyone working on the project are comfortable with them, then go ahead and keep it.

Question 5.1.

The exact way you want to handle non-number input is an implementation detail that'd be up to you.  Do you want to request another input?  Do you want to just strip out the non-numbers and use the numbers that are there?

But as for actually checking the string itself, once you've got it into an NSString, it's quite easy:

NSCharacterSet *nonNumbers = [[NSCharacterSet 
    decimalDigitCharacterSet] invertedSet];

if([yourString rangeOfCharactersFromSet:nonNumbers].location == NSNotFound) {
    // string is all numbers and is good to go
} else {
    // string contains non-number characters
}

5081,5081,8086,Create pass through with Mule ESB 2.2.1,"I'm attempting to set up a config file for Mule ESB 2.2.1 that routes incoming requests to another box. This seems straight forward, but I am getting connection refused exceptions and I'm not sure why. 

Here is the model from my Mule configuration file:

&lt;model name=""ProxySample""&gt;
    &lt;service name=""HttpProxyService""&gt;
        &lt;inbound&gt;
            &lt;http:inbound-endpoint address=""http://localhost:8787"" synchronous=""true""/&gt;
        &lt;/inbound&gt;
        &lt;outbound&gt;
            &lt;pass-through-router&gt;
                &lt;outbound-endpoint address=""http://server2.xyz.com:8080#[header:http.request]"" synchronous=""true""/&gt;
            &lt;/pass-through-router&gt;
        &lt;/outbound&gt;
    &lt;/service&gt;
&lt;/model&gt;


I am browsing to http://localhost:8787/my-site in my browser, thinking that it will route to http://server2.xyz.com:8080/my-site, but I get a connection refused error.

Here is the console output from the Mule server:

So, which tool should I use to compare my hosting provider with other hosting providers?

3770,3770,6003,What's the maximum will a soldier can have per rank? How much willpower does an operative gain per rank?,"I'm trying to make a squad of superhumans to fight the alien scum. To that end I would like to maximize my soldiers' will by reloading at the end of the mission until I'm satisfied with the result. How much will can an operative gain per rank? What's the maximum will a soldier can have at each rank up?

Bonus questions: how likely is a soldier to get the maximum will increase when ranking up? What about high rank soldiers that come as mission rewards?
",kotekzot,https://gaming.stackexchange.com/users/19827,"All rookie soldiers start with 40 Will and gain Will increases as they gain ranks.  They suffer a decrease in Will when they suffer a critical wound in battle.  Therefore, there isn't really a single low number to worry about, as it varies by each rank.  Also, a Squaddie (or any other low ranked soldier) who has been critically wounded can eventually gain enough Will back to be a successful soldier.

The table below shows the low and high Will values a soldier can have, by rank.  By checking each soldier against the table, you can determine if their will is too low for the rank they have.  I've included the low and high Will values for when the Iron Will upgrade has been purchased.  However, I'm not certain how helpful those will be, as you generally purchase that upgrade after your soldiers have been promoted a few times, so you won't expect to see values as high as the columns indicate.

I created the table using the following assumptions:


Each soldier gets a fixed +2 per level.
Each soldier gets a random +1d6 per level (iRandWillIncrease=6 in the ini file).
Each soldier gets another fixed +2 per level when the Iron Will upgrade is purchased (iBaseOTSWillIncrease=2 in the ini file).
Each soldier gets another random +1d4 per level when the Iron Will upgrade is purchased (iRandOTSWillIncrease=4 in the ini file).


(See http://wiki.tesnexus.com/index.php/XCOM:EU_DefaultGameCore.ini_settings for the ini values.)

                        Iron Will
Rank        L   H       L   H
Rookie      40  40      40  40
Squaddie    43  48      46  54
Corporal    46  56      52  68 
Sergeant    49  64      58  82 
Lieutenant  52  72      64  96 
Captain     55  80      70  110 
Major       58  88      76  124 
Colonel     61  96      82  138


The Second Wave options Not Created Equally and Hidden Potential change all of this.  Not Created Equally changes the starting Will from a fixed 40 to a random number between 25-60.  Will increases stay the same.  Hidden Potential changes the Will increases (and all other stat increases) to be random, so there will be a much larger variation of Will values among your soldiers.

How much willpower does an agent gain at each level?,"I want to form a superman team to deal with aliens. For this reason, I hope to reload the will of my soldiers at the end of the mission until I am satisfied with the results. How much can an agent get at each level? What is the maximum value a soldier can get at each level?","All rookie soldiers start with 40 Will and gain Will increases as they gain ranks.  They suffer a decrease in Will when they suffer a critical wound in battle.  Therefore, there isn't really a single low number to worry about, as it varies by each rank.  Also, a Squaddie (or any other low ranked soldier) who has been critically wounded can eventually gain enough Will back to be a successful soldier.

The table below shows the low and high Will values a soldier can have, by rank.  By checking each soldier against the table, you can determine if their will is too low for the rank they have.  I've included the low and high Will values for when the Iron Will upgrade has been purchased.  However, I'm not certain how helpful those will be, as you generally purchase that upgrade after your soldiers have been promoted a few times, so you won't expect to see values as high as the columns indicate.

I created the table using the following assumptions:


Each soldier gets a fixed +2 per level.
Each soldier gets a random +1d6 per level (iRandWillIncrease=6 in the ini file).
Each soldier gets another fixed +2 per level when the Iron Will upgrade is purchased (iBaseOTSWillIncrease=2 in the ini file).
Each soldier gets another random +1d4 per level when the Iron Will upgrade is purchased (iRandOTSWillIncrease=4 in the ini file).


(See http://wiki.tesnexus.com/index.php/XCOM:EU_DefaultGameCore.ini_settings for the ini values.)

                        Iron Will
Rank        L   H       L   H
Rookie      40  40      40  40
Squaddie    43  48      46  54
Corporal    46  56      52  68 
Sergeant    49  64      58  82 
Lieutenant  52  72      64  96 
Captain     55  80      70  110 
Major       58  88      76  124 
Colonel     61  96      82  138


The Second Wave options Not Created Equally and Hidden Potential change all of this.  Not Created Equally changes the starting Will from a fixed 40 to a random number between 25-60.  Will increases stay the same.  Hidden Potential changes the Will increases (and all other stat increases) to be random, so there will be a much larger variation of Will values among your soldiers.  The above table can still be used to check whether you have a soldier who is better or worse than ""normal"", though.

   Faris sent a D-Mail to (probably) herself

As a side question previously it was mentioned that how they can set D-Mail's time of Arrival:

So what is the purpose of passive and active as by two different names?
",john michal,https://ell.stackexchange.com/users/4123,"The sentence may recount the same facts, or it may not. One very significant difference is that in the active voice you must identify the Agent: the person (or other entity) who  performs the action, whereas in the passive you are free to omit the Agent.

Active

Passive


  ok My book was stolen by John.

In either case, the passive voice is employed to focus on the Patient of the action&mdash;the person or thing which 'suffered' it&mdash;rather than on Agent who or which performed it. There are several reasons you might want to do this:


Because you don&rsquo;t know or don&rsquo;t care who performed the action  
Because what is important is the action itself rather than who performed it

2100,2100,3342,Another instructor is pushing me out of the classroom right after my class ends,"I am a graduate student in math in my final year, and for several years have been teaching at my department as a lecturer. This semester, in the same lecture hall there is another lecture that starts 20 minutes after my class ends. It's taught by another instructor from my department. I usually have many students coming to office hours and there are also students asking questions immediately after lecture. Due to other activities, I cannot have office hours right after the lecture this semester and can only stay for about 15 minutes to answer questions.

Many times in the past I had a similar situation and never had any issues with it. This semester the instructor who is teaching right after often arrives 20-15 minutes before her class starts and tells me immediately that I have to go with my students somewhere else. 

I make sure to leave the blackboard clean and take all my stuff away from the instructor's desk before she arrives, but I do believe that I have a right to stay in the classroom after my lecture for at least 5-10 minutes. There is no vacant classroom around, and I don't have time to go with students to my office, which is in a different building.

Last time the instructor told me in front of my students that I don't understand ""simple things"" and that I am ""playing games"". When I was talking to one of my students, she stood very close to us and clearly demonstrated that she wanted us out. I tried to explain her that I couldn't go anywhere else due to my time constraints, but she didn't want to listen to me. I really don't understand what ""simple"" things she meant and what ""games"" I am playing. 

We leave the board clean. She doesn't need to set up a projector. She can still talk to her students before her class starts, if she wants to (even though it seems like her students don't ask her any questions before their class). So, I don't see how I cause any disruption. 

I had met this woman many times before this semester, but we never talked. I didn't see her talking to other instructors/students much, and she seems to be quite reserved and a bit neurotic. She doesn't want to have any conversation with me regarding the issue.

I felt really offended after last class when she said those things to me in front of my students. What would you do in my case? 

Added later: There are no official rules regarding classroom occupancy between classes. Instructors are supposed to use common sense and be reasonable. For me using 50% of the break time seems reasonable to answer questions after lecture seems reasonable. I agree that for some people it may not.

I don't block the entrance to the classroom. A few students from the next class who come earlier always go ahead and take their seats as soon as my students start leaving the room. I also had one of the students from the next class listening to my explanation to one of those after-class questions and asking me further questions before their class (which is the same class as I am teaching, just a different section). Maybe the instructor got jealous, I don't know.

The entrance to the classroom is from its front (not back), so I do stay in the front. But it is a big lecture hall, and there is a plenty of space in front of the room (the board itself consists of 8 huge panels).

Also, during my career as a grad.student who is also teaching for the department, I have had several observations from experienced professors who are considered to be great teachers at the department and are in charge of undergraduate teaching policy. In my evaluations the fact that there are always several students approaching me with questions after class considered as very positive, meaning that students find me approachable. 

Thank you everyone for answers.

273,273,439,How is a transition between drywall and wood typically handled?,"I just finished sheet rocking my living room and am stuck at a stand-still.  My ceiling is 12' feet high at the tallest point and slopes down to 8'.  That said, at the 12' wall, the sheetrock only goes up 8' and is then met by a lap and gap type wood, which then continues up to the ceiling. The wood then slopes (on the wall). At the 8' point of the ceiling, the sheetrock butts up to the ceiling.  

My question is...How would I install a crown moulding or transition piece at the point where the sheetrock meets the wood?  The previous owners had a painted 1x4 where the paneling (now sheetrock) met the wood. However, I am wanting something a bit nicer than just a 1x4 transition.

Either I am the only person out there with a room like this or I am searching incorrectly on Google.  Does anyone have any ideas or pictures on this? I can definitely provide pictures if needed. I am tempted to pull the wood all the way to ceiling and continue the sheetrock all the way up. Any advice would be much appreciated!
",Cory,https://diy.stackexchange.com/users/39028,"Here's a few options I can think of.

Lap joint

If the wood is a bit thicker than the drywall, you could use a router to remove some of the material on the back side of the lowest plank (may require installing an additional plank, or extending the drywall). Then allow the lowest plank to lap over the drywall. Make sure you leave enough of a gap between the two materials, to allow for expansion and contraction.



Transition

Another option would be to use a transition strip, like the ones commonly used in flooring. You'd use T-molding if the materials are even with each other, or a reducer if they're not.



Molding

A simple 1x4 like the previous owners had, or a more decorative piece of molding could be used.

1630,1630,2554,Why don't wifi managers remember mac addresses for hotspots to defeat the jasager attack?,"So I just learned about the jasager attack, via the wifi pineapple and it struck me immediately that it wouldn't work at all if network managers (privately) associated MAC addresses with hotspots and asked for explicit permission if you were going to connect to a new physical device.

I haven't found any wifi managers that do this, or at least I haven't found information that any do.

My question: 


Am I missing something obvious? Would remembering MACs not actually increase security?

2725,2725,4342,What's the base f-stop when counting an ideal f-stop for lens?,"I've read a lot around this site that an ideal quality of the lens is achieved when using f-stop roughly 2 stops slower than the fastest value of the lens.

Firstly, I'm not exactly sure what ""2 stops"" mean when it comes to f-stop, but this isn't really important in what I'm about to ask. What I'd like to know is what is the base f-stop when counting this value.

Let's look at it this way: If I have a prime lens with f/1.8, then obviously I'll be getting the ideal value from f/1.8, let's say after 2 stops I get f/2.8?

But! What in case of zoom lenses, for example 18-55, which have f-stop f/3.5 - f/5.6. Should I take f/5.6 as my base value, or does the base value depends on the real fastest value at the exact focal length?

Therefore, if I set the lens to 18 mm, their fastest aperture is f/3.5 and thus the ideal quality is at f/5.6 and when I set it to 55 mm, their fastest aperture is f/5.6 and thus the ideal quality is at f/8 ? Or is it f/8 for the whole focal range ?
",Richard Rodriguez,https://photo.stackexchange.com/users/4822,"Real fastest value at the exact focal length.

But, this is just a rule of thumb — it's not necessarily exactly two stops in every case.

For the question of what two stops mean, see What does f-stop mean?. In short, each stop is approximately the-square-root-of-two times the previous one. That means half the light is allowed in (which is why the seemingly-weird series of numbers was chosen). Two stops is doing that twice, which conveniently works out to simply being doubling. Two stops from f/2 is f/4, and and two stops from that is f/8. Or, starting at f/1.8, two stops is f/3.6.

The test results comparison tool used by Digital Photography Review is interesting for looking at this. Try this test of Pentax's 18-55mm zoom, which like most kit zooms goes from f/3.5 at the short end to f/5.6 zoomed out.

You can see that at 18mm, the sharpness improves as you go from f/3.5 to f/4 to f/5.6. At f/8, it's more even from center to corners, but doesn't get any sharper. And beyond that, it drops off.

Then, change the focal length to 55mm. You'll notice that with this lens, overall sharpness goes down from 18mm at f/5.6. At f/8, it picks up a little bit, and a little more at f/11, and then back down again at f/16.

So, that fits with the two-stops guideline pretty well. Same for the Canon kit lens, and Nikon too.

With the Pentax DA 15mm f/4 Limited test, they've got test results in third-stops, and there you can see that f/7.1 is no better than f/6.3, and f/8 is worse — so that's only 1⅓ stops. On the other hand the DA★ 55mm f/1.4 shows peak sharpness at f/4.5 — closed down by 3⅓ stops. This doesn't reflect a problem with the lens, just different priorities in design. The Nikon 50mm f/1.4G is similar, with peak sharpness at 3⅔ or 4 stops down. However, the entry level Nikkor f/1.8G fits the ""two stops"" guide quite well, peaking at around f/3.5.

It's also worth noting that this test is primarily concerned with sharpness, because that's easy to measure. Other image quality and rendering characteristics are also affected. Vignetting (light falloff in the corners) gets better the more you stop down, and it's usually gone after two stops. And bokeh quality is usually improved by stopping down, too — generally, lens bokeh is nicer/smoother stopped down a bit, but of course it's less visible since you have greater depth of field. Plus, shape of the aperture blades will become visible in specular highlights, which is a side-effect unrelated to stopping down per se — some modern lenses have rounded aperture blades to make that not be a concern.

5604,5604,8892,Office 365 SharePoint v1.0 API Authorization Issue,"I have a client app that uses the Office 365 SharePoint preview API. Recently (as of October 2014), Microsoft published version 1.0 of that API. The authentication steps used with the preview API no longer work with version 1.0.

To demonstrate the problem I have created a short node.js script. The script does the following:


Authorizes by launching a browser. Gives a redirect URL to localhost and launches a server to catch the redirect post-authorization
POST to https://login.windows.net/common/oauth2/token to get an access token
GET to the Office 365 discovery service to get the SharePoint API endpoint
POST to https://login.windows.net/common/oauth2/token with a refresh token to get a new access token
GET to the SharePoint API endpoint to get a list of files


The script can be used with the preview API and version 1.0 of the API. It is able to get a JSON list of files from the preview API, but fails with the following for version 1.0 (on the last call):


{
    ""error"": {
        ""code"": ""-2147024891, System.UnauthorizedAccessException"",
        ""message"": ""Access denied. You do not have permission to perform this action or access this resource.""
    }
}


Does anybody see anything wrong with the sequence of calls?

Please take a look at the sample script for more details.

Right now we're starting out with basic Java and such (so right from the bottom you might say) - which is fine, I have no programming experience apart from knowing how to do ""Hello World"" in Java.

I keep hearing that mathematics is pertinent to coding, but how is it so? What general examples would show how mathematics and programming go together, or are reliant on one another?

I apologize of my question is vague, I'm barely starting to get a rough idea of the kind of world I'm stepping into as a code monkey student...
",Rory,https://programmers.stackexchange.com/users/48536,"First off: I am a mathematician - a professional one (in that I get paid for doing maths).  I am not a programmer.  I do do some programming, but very definitely of the Cargo Cult variety (see first comment to http://tex.stackexchange.com/q/451/86 and my response) and nothing of the sort that would normally bring me to this site (indeed, I registered here to post this answer after seeing a link to it in the TeX chat room).

The summary of my answer is: Mathematics is Programming.

I recently got to teach a mathematics course to a non-mathematical group of students.  They were the programming section.  I thought this was fantastic!  At last, I was going to be able to teach mathematics to people who already understood the basic ideas and who already had a rudimentary toolkit for doing maths.  I was incredibly disappointed when I asked how many of them had actually written a program and got an answer somewhere between 0 and 1.

Before I go on, I should clarify a few things.  There are areas of mathematics that concern themselves directly with programming and are to do with evaluating algorithms and classifying languages and such-like.  I'm not talking about those.  There is also a program which is trying to translate all of mathematics into a formal language that can be evaluated by a computer.  This is a bit closer to what I'm talking about, but even so to focus on that would miss the main part of what I'm trying to say.  The mathematics that I do and the programming that I do are almost completely unrelated by topic.  The connection between them is on a different level.

Where I'd like to start is with the comment on the main question:


  If that is doing math, then all human activity is a form of math. If that's the case then the word math doesn't have a useful meaning, because it can't be used to distinguish one activity from another.


Yes, that is doing maths.  But ""maths"" is still a useful word because, as the song says, ""It ain't what you do, it's the way that you do it."".  I would say that I am doing maths when I am approaching something in a mathematical way.  Sometimes, that is ""hard core"" mathematics: formulating definitions, proving theorems.  Sometimes, it isn't.  Sometimes, it's writing silly little programs so that my kids can learn their spelling words.

This is what mathematics helps me with when I program:


Abstraction This is probably the most important transferable skill from mathematics.  By this, I mean the ability to strip away all the unnecessary stuff and focus on the important properties.
Perspective If I could only choose one thing that all my students were to learn, this would be it: The ability to change ones point of view to suit the problem.  We commonly treat this in linear algebra with change-of-basis formulae (that lead to horrendous matrices and horrendous complications), but it is much more applicable than that.  At heart, it is the idea that just because something has been presented to you in one fashion, that doesn't have to be the way you work with it.  This separates ones view of the thing itself from the way it has been presented.  This can be extremely practical: it is all about making something useful or efficient.  If I have a list of vectors and it is more efficient to store them as a list of x-coordinates and a list of y-coordinates, so be it.
Form versus Function Leading on from the above; if a thing can be presented in many different ways then it is no longer fair to say that one particular presentation is the thing.  To misquote that song again: ""It ain't what you are it's what you do"" that matters.


I could go on, but those are the ones that spring to mind.

Now, there are probably lots of (negative) reactions to what I've written so far.  One will be ""That's not maths, that's just good sense."" (or bad sense) to which I refer to my remark above agreeing with the sentiment that ""all human activity is a form of math"".  Another will be ""That isn't the type of maths meant in the question."".  This is almost certainly true and here I actually have a lot more sympathy with the person who said ""At least I haven't touched the maths for 10 years,"".  He or she is wrong, of course, they have been doing maths for 10 years because whenever they wrote a program they were doing maths.  They just didn't realise it.  And here we get to the point about why I was delighted with the (sadly unrealised) possibility of teaching mathematics to students who were already programmers.

I do actually use some ""real maths"" in my programs.  I recently coded a fun 3D shape explorer which involved using some maths to figure out the projections and other transformations that I had to apply to my data.  I was mildly amused to find myself actually coding quaternions!  But of course, the maths that was involved was trivial compared to the maths that I do when I'm working.  It was ""back of envelope"" stuff.  That type of maths, then I agree with the sentiment that you pick it up when you need it, and if you need something more complicated than you can find on Wikipedia then you find a real mathematician to do it for you.  However, in order that you can pick it up when you need it then you need to have learnt something.  That thing might not be anything you ever actually use, but having learnt that something makes it all the easier to pick up what you do actually use later in life.  So this is where I disagree with Coder: you do need to learn some mathematics if you are ever going to use any mathematics and you need to learn it from the mathematical side (which doesn't mean proving theorems, by the way).

And so finally to the ""Mathematics is Programming"".  You can learn all of these things from being a good programmer.  And if you've learnt these things, you will find mathematics much easier because you will understand that when we talk about a vector in a vector space then it's just an instance of the class Vector which means that we can do all the things that Vector does to that instance: add, subtract, scale, and so forth.  That's why I would love to teach mathematics to programmers.  But, speaking as a mathematician, I would say that the first of these, ""Abstraction"", is easier to learn in mathematics than in programming because mathematics is the pursuit of abstraction.  Whenever we see some behaviour our training is always to ask ""What is it about that thing that makes it behave in that way?  What if I took another thing that was similar, would it behave in the same way?  How much of what that thing is would I have to lose for it to stop behaving like that?""  (Taking this to the extreme leads to ""centipede mathematics"" - search for the term).  But we don't do this with (just) ""real world"" objects (whatever they are), we do this with things that have already been abstracted.

This has gone on long enough, so let me close with one of the classic mathematician jokes:


  A mathematician and a physicist both attended a seminar on some new model involving 24 dimensional space.  Afterwards, they were discussing it and the physicist remarked: ""That was really hard.  I mean, how does one visualise 24-dimensional space?"" to which the mathematician replied: ""Oh, it's easy.  Just visualise n-dimensional space and then set n = 24."".

There were quite a few comments on this answer expressing a variety of views.  These have now been deleted by a moderator on the understanding that I would try to take into incorporate them (or respond to them) in my answer.

However, I'm not sure that I can.  Reading those comments and the rest of what's on this page, I can only come to the conclusion that there is a huge misunderstanding as to what mathematics actually is.  Moreover, I don't feel competent enough to explain it.  Fortunately, someone has already linked to Lockhart's Lament so I'll defer the explanation to that.  Whilst I might have put it differently (as I grew up in a scientific environment, I would have put more emphasis on the experimental nature of mathematics), I don't think I could put it better.

I do still think I can add something.  As well as the misunderstandings as to what mathematics is, there are also misunderstandings as to what ""doing mathematics"" means.  I see two almost contradictory stances:


Mathematics is about equations and formulas.  So there's no need to study it because Wikipedia exists (this is almost the converse of Euler's apocryphal challenge to Diderot).
Mathematics is about theorems and definitions.  So there's no need to study it as programs never prove anything (which is about as complete a fallacy as ... insert favourite fallacy here).


Whilst the two stances contradict each other, they end up in the same place: there's no point in a programmer learning any mathematics - and most assuredly not from a mathematician!  After all, what do they know about anything?  Anything that a programmer really needs to know can be found in Wikipedia, or cribbed off someone else.

Above, I described myself as a Cargo Cult Programmer.  I bet most of you had a private giggle to yourself and thought, ""Ah yes, I bet I know what your programs look like then."".  You probably felt a bit smug and superior (though I'm sure you felt bad about feeling smug and superior).

What I've described just above is Cargo Cult Mathematics.

So when I say that you should learn a bit of mathematics to understand how mathematics works, I'm saying it for exactly the same reason as you might if you saw a bit of code that I'd written: ""How much easier your life would be if you'd stop cut-and-pasting code from StackOverflow and learnt just a bit about how to do it properly."".

The most important thing, though, is that you should learn it from mathematicians.  Why so?  Here's an analogy.  The language that I'm most adept at is TeX.  (Says it all, really!).  Now, suppose I want to learn a bit more about TeX and it just so happens that Don Knuth is in town and has offered to give some tutorials on TeX.  Or I could just read about it on Wikipedia.  Or maybe it's Perl and Larry Wall, or C# (is that the right one?) and Jon Skeet.  It may well be that these people are not the best teachers, but they sure make up for it in the amount that they know!

And that's what mathematicians are.  We're the people who write the actual language, who then write the libraries that you use.  Of course, you don't have to know how to prove a theorem - you're not going to write a library!  But if you know a bit about how we think, then it might help you understand why we wrote the library the way we did, and if you understand that it might help you make better use of it.

There is a middle ground between looking up equations on Wikipedia and proving the Poincar&eacute; conjecture, just as - to refer to Lockhart's lament - there is a middle ground between ""I don't really know much about art, but I know what I like"" and being Monet, and between ""Where's the 'ANY' key?"" and being Don Knuth.  If you are still in university then you have an amazing opportunity to learn from people who are experts in their area and who - for some reason - are willing to spend their time explaining it to you.



The other point I wanted to expand on a bit was why as a programmer you should not be scared of learning a bit more mathematics.  It's not the Deep Connections, nor the usefulness.  It's that your ability to program a computer can directly help you learn mathematics.  I just want to mention a few.


Understanding variables.  So many people get confused by simple statements like ""Let n be a natural number ..."".  Or ""Let epsilon > 0"".  There are places in mathematics where it's important to remember the scope of a variable.  These are all commonplace in programming.  Learn to translate a mathematical statement into a program and you'll find it much easier to keep track of what's what.
The nature of proof.  If you've ever written a test, or written a program to be used by someone else, then you understand the core of proofs.  When you do that, you have to know that whatever the user puts in, you can deal with it (insert obligatory xkcd reference here).  That's all a proof is!  A demonstration that whatever the ""user/universe"" puts in, the statement will hold.  Experimentalists will lean to the ""If it works under normal circumstances, it's true"" but programmers know that there is always that kid who will try Alt+G+Shift+ÅØÆ just to see what happens.
DRY.  Sorry to break this to you, but we invented it, not you.  We've been ""not repeating ourselves"" for millennia.  That's why I have a copy of Euclid's elements on my shelves and it's still useful.


And there's more.  If I knew a bit more about programming, I'd write a book called ""Mathematics for Programmers"" where the aim wasn't to teach ""The mathematics that programmers should know"" but ""mathematics that everyone should know, but optimised for programmers"".  But I'll probably never know enough about programming to write it - unless someone offers to collaborate with me!



I'll leave it there.  Probably if I thought more, I'd change what I've written; hopefully I'd explain it better.  In a months' time I might even disagree with parts of it.  If anyone wishes to argue further, or comment otherwise, probably best not to do so in the comments here.  You know where to find me.

Now let's start with basic Java (you might say from the bottom), which is good. I have no programming experience except knowing how to do ""Hello world"" in Java.","First off: I am a mathematician - a professional one (in that I get paid for doing maths).  I am not a programmer.  I do do some programming, but very definitely of the Cargo Cult variety (see first comment to http://tex.stackexchange.com/q/451/86 and my response) and nothing of the sort that would normally bring me to this site (indeed, I registered here to post this answer after seeing a link to it in the TeX chat room).

The summary of my answer is: Mathematics is Programming.

I recently got to teach a mathematics course to a non-mathematical group of students.  They were the programming section.  I thought this was fantastic!  At last, I was going to be able to teach mathematics to people who already understood the basic ideas and who already had a rudimentary toolkit for doing maths.  I was incredibly disappointed when I asked how many of them had actually written a program and got an answer somewhere between 0 and 1.

Before I go on, I should clarify a few things.  There are areas of mathematics that concern themselves directly with programming and are to do with evaluating algorithms and classifying languages and such-like.  I'm not talking about those.  There is also a program which is trying to translate all of mathematics into a formal language that can be evaluated by a computer.  This is a bit closer to what I'm talking about, but even so to focus on that would miss the main part of what I'm trying to say.  The mathematics that I do and the programming that I do are almost completely unrelated by topic.  The connection between them is on a different level.

Where I'd like to start is with the comment on the main question:


  If that is doing math, then all human activity is a form of math. If that's the case then the word math doesn't have a useful meaning, because it can't be used to distinguish one activity from another.


Yes, that is doing maths.  But ""maths"" is still a useful word because, as the song says, ""It ain't what you do, it's the way that you do it."".  I would say that I am doing maths when I am approaching something in a mathematical way.  Sometimes, that is ""hard core"" mathematics: formulating definitions, proving theorems.  Sometimes, it isn't.  Sometimes, it's writing silly little programs so that my kids can learn their spelling words.

This is what mathematics helps me with when I program:


Abstraction This is probably the most important transferable skill from mathematics.  By this, I mean the ability to strip away all the unnecessary stuff and focus on the important properties.
Perspective If I could only choose one thing that all my students were to learn, this would be it: The ability to change ones point of view to suit the problem.  We commonly treat this in linear algebra with change-of-basis formulae (that lead to horrendous matrices and horrendous complications), but it is much more applicable than that.  At heart, it is the idea that just because something has been presented to you in one fashion, that doesn't have to be the way you work with it.  This separates ones view of the thing itself from the way it has been presented.  This can be extremely practical: it is all about making something useful or efficient.  If I have a list of vectors and it is more efficient to store them as a list of x-coordinates and a list of y-coordinates, so be it.
Form versus Function Leading on from the above; if a thing can be presented in many different ways then it is no longer fair to say that one particular presentation is the thing.  To misquote that song again: ""It ain't what you are it's what you do"" that matters.


I could go on, but those are the ones that spring to mind.

Now, there are probably lots of (negative) reactions to what I've written so far.  One will be ""That's not maths, that's just good sense."" (or bad sense) to which I refer to my remark above agreeing with the sentiment that ""all human activity is a form of math"".  Another will be ""That isn't the type of maths meant in the question."".  This is almost certainly true and here I actually have a lot more sympathy with the person who said ""At least I haven't touched the maths for 10 years,"".  He or she is wrong, of course, they have been doing maths for 10 years because whenever they wrote a program they were doing maths.  They just didn't realise it.  And here we get to the point about why I was delighted with the (sadly unrealised) possibility of teaching mathematics to students who were already programmers.

2391,2391,3816,What are the symmetries of a principal homogeneous bundle?,"Let $\operatorname{Klein}$ denote the category of principal homogeneous bundles. An object in this category is a tuple $\mathbf Q = (Q, P; G, H; q, a, \tilde a)$, where:


$G$ is a Lie group, and $H$ is a closed subgroup;
$P$ is a $G$-torsor and the manifold $Q$ is diffeomorphic to the quotient $G/H$;
The (left) actions $\tilde a : G \to \operatorname{Aut}(P)$ and $a : G \to \operatorname{Aut}(Q)$ are morphisms of topological groups; and
$q :P \to Q$ is a principal $H$-bundle.


A morphism $\Phi : \mathbf Q \to \mathbf Q'$ is described by a tuple $\Phi = (\varphi, \tilde \varphi, f)$, where $\varphi : Q \to Q'$ and $\tilde \varphi : P \to P'$ are diffeomorphisms which commute with the bundle maps $q : P \to Q$ and $q' : P' \to Q'$, and $f : G \to G'$ is a morphism of Lie groups mapping $H$ to $H'$, and which satisfies the identity $$\tilde a'_{f(g)} \circ \tilde \varphi = \tilde \varphi \circ \tilde a_g$$ for all $g \in G$. 



I think that this is the correct categorical description of principal homogeneous bundles; please correct me if I'm wrong. I selected the name $\operatorname{Klein}$ in homage to Felix Klein and his Erlangen Program.

It seems that such a bundle $\mathbf Q$ contains all the data on its symmetries. Namely, I think that its automorphism group $\operatorname{Aut}(\mathbf Q)$ is isomorphic to its Lie group Lie group $G = G(\mathbf Q)$?

It is easy to see that there is a natural map $K : G \hookrightarrow \operatorname{Aut}(\mathbf Q)$, in that each $u \in G$ corresponds to a unique automorphism $K_u \in \operatorname{Aut}(\mathbf Q)$. The morphism $K_u = (k_u, \tilde k_u, c_u)$ is defined by $$k_u(q) = a_u(q), \quad \tilde k_u(p) = \tilde a_u(p), \quad \mathrm{and} \quad c_u(g) = ugu^{-1}.$$ That is, the morphism $K_u$ acts by left-multiplication on both $Q$ and $P$, but by left-conjugation on $G$.


Is this map $K$ surjective? i.e., is $\operatorname{Aut}(\mathbf Q)$ isomorphic to $G = G(\mathbf Q)$?


If the answer is yes, then I think that this captures the notion of ""internal symmetries"" of the bundle, since these are the transformations which preserve the bundle structure. 

However, I know that groupoids also show up to describe symmetries in a categorical setting, and I would be interested to hear more on that point of view.


How can groupoids be used to describe symmetries in this category?

335,335,535,Do the online LaTeX compilers use a TeX daemon to speed up their compilation?,"There seem to be quite a few fabulous web-sites now that compile LaTeX online.

I was wondering what techniques these sites used to speed up compilation of documents. It would seem they would be particularly interested in reducing the CPU load from loading the compiler, especially as many of the documents they would be asked to create would be relatively small.

In my experience it seems like the ordinary process for creating a relatively small document with LaTeX, especially XeLaTeX, seems to take a substantial amount of time starting the compiler (e.g. a couple seconds), and a relatively very modest amount of time running it (a few milliseconds).

It would seem then that one could gain tremendous improvements in performance  for relatively small documents by running (PDF/Xe)LaTeX as a daemon that produced a number of documents without having to restart the process.

Others seem to have tried this, and it has been discussed (also) on Tex.SE before. The techniques seem to be somewhat dated, and in any case I couldn't get them to work on Linux with XeLaTeX (which just happens to be what I'm using).

Are any of the online compilers using a sort of TeX daemon to compile their documents in the background? Are there any other recent developments in this area? I happen to be personally interested in the XeLaTeX on Linux, but I would love to know more about what is happening in the LaTeX performance area.

There also seems to be quite a bit of discussion about pre-compilation (as seen under eg performance), but I tried it and the benefits do not seem to be as great as that of daemonizing the process (though I would stand to be proven correct!).

Are there other techniques these online services may be using to improve the response time of compilation?
",Brian M. Hunt,https://tex.stackexchange.com/users/1744,"I don't know the techniques they use, however, I may be able to shed some light from a general systems viewpoint:

First and formost, pdflatex is a CPU-bound program (see Tips for choosing hardware for best LaTeX compile performance). On any modern operating system and hardware it should take less than a couple of milliseconds to start it inside a new process and this startup time should be insignificant in relation to the computational work done for the typesetting. Hence, even in a massive multi-user setting, the benefits of running it inside a preloaded daemon would be relatively small. 

Most disk IO is related to a restricted set of files (the standard classes and packages), which therefore will reside in the buffer cache. However, on a standard server today, it would even be not a problem to cache all TexLive packages and fonts (hey, this are just a few GiB). 

If hundreds or thousands of program instances run in parallel, their memory working sets would furthermore share large parts of the physical memory. Basically, all non-volatile memory (program code, constant data) is shared among all pdflatex processes. Under the hood, the operating system initially ""shares everything"" and transparently creates a private copy of each memory page only when a process attempts to write to it. So memory that is never written remains always shared.

To sum up: Given a modern hardware and operating-system environment, I would not expect signficant benefits by the daemon approach.

697,697,1102,The deceitful spirit sent by God,"
  1 Kings 22:19-28
  
  19 Micaiah continued, “Therefore hear the word of the Lord: I saw the Lord sitting on his throne with all the multitudes of heaven standing around him on his right and on his left. 20 And the Lord said, ‘Who will entice Ahab into attacking Ramoth Gilead and going to his death there?’
  
  “One suggested this, and another that. 21 Finally, a spirit came forward, stood before the Lord and said, ‘I will entice him.’
  
  22 “‘By what means?’ the Lord asked.
  
  “‘I will go out and be a deceiving spirit in the mouths of all his prophets,’ he said.
  
  “‘You will succeed in enticing him,’ said the Lord. ‘Go and do it.’
  
  23 “So now the Lord has put a deceiving spirit in the mouths of all these prophets of yours. The Lord has decreed disaster for you.”
  
  24 Then Zedekiah son of Kenaanah went up and slapped Micaiah in the face. “Which way did the spirit from[a] the Lord go when he went from me to speak to you?” he asked.
  
  25 Micaiah replied, “You will find out on the day you go to hide in an inner room.”
  
  26 The king of Israel then ordered, “Take Micaiah and send him back to Amon the ruler of the city and to Joash the king’s son 27 and say, ‘This is what the king says: Put this fellow in prison and give him nothing but bread and water until I return safely.’”
  
  28 Micaiah declared, “If you ever return safely, the Lord has not spoken through me.” Then he added, “Mark my words, all you people!”


So God sends a spirit enticing Ahab in order to attack Ramoth Gilead. If I may dare ask, why does God feel the need to send a deceiving spirit? Would this not go against the Commandments God has given? And why was such a spirit even within the close proximity in the presence of the Lord in the first place? I wish to know how to reconciling this text with others.

I think that covers most of the details. See http://www.tuaw.com/2010/05/04/msmtp-a-free-tool-to-send-email-from-terminal/ if you want a few more specifics.

366,366,577,Can't verify signature in JAVA but success in .NET,"We have old system using .NET 3.5 (run on Windows Server 2003 32bits) to verify e-receipts from our customers (all use SHA1RSA algorithm as agreement). We store their certificates in database in Base64 string. Old code look like that:

//Store certificates
String certificateEncodeBase64 = Convert.ToBase64String(byteArrayCertificateFile);

//Verify signatures

//Hash algorithm SHA-1
HashAlgorithm hashAlgrothm = new SHA1Managed();
//Data
byte[] data = System.Text.Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(request.DataInUTF8);
//Signature
byte[] signature = Convert.FromBase64String(request.SignatureInBase64);
//Certificate
X509Certificate2 certificate = new X509Certificate2(Convert.FromBase64String(certEncodeBase64));
//Verify using algorithm RSA
RSACryptoServiceProvider pubKey = (RSACryptoServiceProvider)certificate.PublicKey.Key    
bool vr = pubKey.VerifyData(data, hashAlgrothm, signature);


Nothing issues except the performance is not good. That's why we want to move to new system using Java 1.7 (run on Windows Server 2012 64 bits). Our new code look like that:

//Using the same DB store certificates

//Verify signatures using Bouncy Castle JCE Provider

//Hash data using SHA-1
byte[] data_ = request.getDataInUTF8().getBytes(""UTF-8"");
MessageDigest messageDigest_ = MessageDigest.getInstance(""SHA-1"", ""BC"");
byte[] hashed = messageDigest.digest(data);
//Signature
byte [] signature = new BASE64Decoder().decodeBuffer(request.getSignatureInBase64());
//Certificate
CertificateFactory certificateFactory = CertificateFactory.getInstance(""X509"", ""BC"");
byte[] buffer = new BASE64Decoder().decodeBuffer(certEncodeBase64);
ByteArrayInputStream byteArrayCertificateInputStream = new ByteArrayInputStream(buffer);
Certificate certificate = certificateFactory.generateCertificate(byteArrayCertificateInputStream);
//Verify using algorithm RSA
Signature verifyEngine = Signature.getInstance(""RSA"", ""BC"");
verifyEngine.initVerify(certificate);
verifyEngine.update(hashed);
result = verifyEngine.verify(signature);


And we get this problem: In our test using all verified data taken from old system, new system verify some customer's data but some customers always return fail.

}
catch (Exception e)

sig is

137,137,217,Is there any significant ranking penalty for using 302 redirects to force HTTPS?,"We have a site with:


Decent ranking on certain targeted keywords.
An HTTPS-only policy, which uses 302 redirects to force clients onto the secure version of any URL.
Internal links using HTTPS, so there is no redirection.
Some, but not all, external links from other domains use HTTPS. The rest do not and will of course be subject to the 302.
Google is only indexing the HTTPS version of each URL. Even if you search specifically for the HTTP URL, only the HTTPS URL is shown in the results.


Will there be any significant, immediate ranking benefit to changing our site to use 301 redirects to enforce HTTPS? Are there any statements from Google, Matt Cutts or other authorities on this specific situation?

Based on my research the difference should be minimal since we are already well indexed, and our internal links are fine, so Google is not going to apply a sitewide penalty for the 302s, which are, in effect, only the first link in the chain.
",Jordan Rieger,https://webmasters.stackexchange.com/users/27841,"I took a quick look at our latest keyword rankings report. This report is produced manually in-house based on the actual result rank we achieve for searches on Google for specific keyword phrases that we are targeting. (A top 10 rank is obviously desirable as it puts us on the first page of results, a top 6 is even better as it puts us above the fold on most monitors, and anything less than a top 50 is almost worthless because so few users click that far into the results.) Currently we are tracking 17 different phrases on a weekly basis. I think this report gives us the most direct way to measure our SEO results.

I compared our rankings on our August 2nd report to our August 15th report; the change went live on August 8th. The result is that out of 17 different phrases, only 2 improved in the rankings, 6 remained the same, and 9 decreased. Overall, the magnitude of the moves down and up were not terribly dramatic. Of course, in the time between the reports, we were also making the normal adjustments that any business makes to its content, and competitors were doing the same, so it's impossible to determine exactly how much difference the 301 made versus the 302 for us. But based on these results, the direct answer to my question about specific, immediate ranking benefit is that there probably is none. These results suggest that in the following situation, Google is smart enough to know that a 302 really means a 301:


302 is redirecting to the HTTPS version of the same URL
HTTP version is no longer accessible
Google search results are only showing HTTPS version, not HTTP
Google site tools still show some residual PageRank for the HTTP version (I discovered this after posting the question) possibly because external sites are still widely linking to your HTTP version


If your situation matches all the above criteria, there is reason to believe that Google is not penalizing you for the 302's. That agrees with the opinion of at least one SEO consultant company, who says: 


  Google recognizes that many people use 302 when they really mean 301.
  Fortunately, Google isn't bound by any law to take people literally.
  For the sake of producing the best possible search results, Google can
  and should look at 302s and figure out if the webmaster really means
  302, or if it's run-of-the-mill confusion and they really mean 301.


I would definitely like to see some more experiments 
situations where the 302 is consistently going to the HTTPS version of the exact same URL, and the HTTP version is no longer accessible. I found a similar experiment, with a slightly different situation, which proved that 302 does indeed confer some page rank, especially if the source and target pages are relevant to eachother. (In our situation, the pages were identical, which may explain why we were doing OK with the 302's.)

All that said, there is no good reason to use 302's for permanent redirects if you can help it, and we will be sticking with 301's. In our case, our ASP.Net code was doing the redirects via Response.Redirect(), and the default behavior in ASP.Net is to use a 302. Only with .NET 4.0 did Microsoft add a convenient Response.RedirectPemanent() method. Until then you had to manually write the 301 header, PHP-style, and most of our developers did not bother since they were used to redirects within application workflows, to which 302's are well suited. But we are happy to be using 301 redirects everywhere we can now.

912,912,1447,Hibernate does not allow an embedded object with an int field to be null?,"Hibernate does not allow me to persist an object that contains an null embedded object with an integer field.  For example, if I have a class called Thing that looks like this

@Entity
public class Thing {

    @Id
    public String id;

    public Part part;

}


where Part is an embeddable class that looks like this

@Embeddable
public class Part {

    public String a;    

    public int b;

}


then trying to persist a Thing object with a null Part causes Hibernate to throw an Exception.  In particular, this code

Thing th = new Thing();
th.id = ""thing.1"";
th.part = null;
session.saveOrUpdate(th);


causes Hibernate to throw this Exception

org.hibernate.PropertyValueException: not-null property references a null or transient value: com.ace.moab.api.jobs.Thing.part


My guess is that this is happening because Part is an embedded class and so Part.a and Part.b are simply columns in the Thing database table.   Since the Thing.part is null Hibernate wants to set the Part.a and Part.b column values to null for the row for thing.1.  However, Part.b is an integer and Hibernate will not allow integer columns in the database to be null.  This is what causes the Exception, right?

So I am looking for workarounds for this problem.  I noticed making Part.b an Integer instead of an int seems to work, but for reasons I won't bore you with this is not a good option for us.  Thanks!

As far as I know, if you can't make the field nullable (by making it an Integer, as you guessed), the only way around this is to create a custom Hibernate type. Should be doable, but it'll be a pain to do it that way. In fact, it'd likely be worse than whatever the reason is you can't use an Integer — so what is that reason, anyway?

As far as I know, if you can't make the field nullable (by making it an Integer, as you guessed), the only way around this is to create a custom Hibernate type. Should be doable, but it'll be a pain to do it that way. In fact, it'd likely be worse than whatever the reason is you can't use an Integer — so what is that reason, anyway?

",jj2,https://judaism.stackexchange.com/users/11533,"The Hebrew used in the Tanakh is often the source for most of Modern Hebrew. However, influences of history have changed the modern day Hebrew in ways that are not always so noticeable. For Example:

A lot of Aramaic has slipped its way into modern Hebrew, even down to the most basic words.

Father in Tanakh: ""Av""
Father in Modern Hebrew: ""Abba"" (Aramaic)

This is not a unique phenomenon, the Tanakh itself has loan words from other languages. If you asked the average Israeli, they would not know that Abba is Aramaic in origin.

The reversing waw/vav is also heavily prevalent in Biblical Hebrew (but by no means is used 100% of the time). It's common English name of the reversing waw/vav is because it switches the past tense to future tense, and future tense to past tense, simply by adding a waw to the front of the verb. You often see a mixing of the normal verb conjugation with a sprinkling of this reversing waw in many paragraphs, including the first paragraph of the Torah.

Some other oddities would include the verb roots having changed as Hebrew pronunciation by communities caused mistakes to become the new norm. i can't remember the word off the top of my head, but i remember that the root in the Tanakh had an Ayin, but in modern Hebrew, the Ayin was replaced with an Aleph, most likely due to the pronunciation of Ayin being lost in many communities and the writing reflecting the pronunciation.

Another possible large difference is the use of the ""present tense."" Modern Hebrew has an established present tense, while according to Historians and Biblical grammarians, Biblical Hebrew has no ""present tense."" According to them, Biblical Hebrew has only two tenses, perfect tense (action is complete) and imperfect tense (action is not yet complete). For them, words/conjugations that we would call present tense are actually ""active participles."" An example of what this means/looks like would be the following:


  אָנִי שׁוֹמֵר אוֹתֶךָ
  
  How the text translates in Modern Hebrew: ""I am guarding you."" 
  
  How the text translates in Biblical Hebrew according to Historians: ""I am the
  one that guards you.""


But if you try and make the argument of Biblical Hebrew not having a present tense to your local Rabbi, be prepared for some resistance. The prior two times i had mentioned in a Synagogue setting that Biblical Hebrew did not have a present tense, it led to a very long debate in which the Rabbi's would refuse to allow anyone who heard my statement to walk away with the belief that Biblical Hebrew didn't have a present tense.

If you are building a public API, using REST with JSON or XML is popular in part because it's a very generic way to expose an API since clients don't generally need to generate code to use your API. Whereas with something like SOAP, code generation for the client is a lot more standard. If your clients are javascript, for instance, it's quite easy to use a RESTful service. If your API is only for internal consumption (i.e. you own the client and the server), then the benefits of REST are somewhat diminished, and it may be easier to use something like WCF.

In general, REST is a good choice when you don't mind being limited to HTTP, your service endpoints can be described well using RESTful concepts, you don't need a contract (like a WSDL), and when you don't want to worry that a client of your service won't be supported for technical reasons.

964,964,1527,Applescript Delay not working since switch to Yosemite,"Ever since I upgraded to Yosemite, Applescripts that use delays have stopped working.  How can I fix this?

Here's the world's simplest Applescript, for the sake of an easy example:

set volume output volume 0
delay 5
set volume output volume 20
delay 5
set volume output volume 0
delay 5
set volume output volume 20
delay 5
set volume output volume 0
delay 5
set volume output volume 20
delay 5
set volume output volume 0


That should take 30 seconds to complete.  If I run it in Script Editor (formerly Applescript Editor) it takes 30 seconds to complete.  But if I save this script as an app, when I launch the app, the delays are ignored and the app takes a fraction of a second to complete.

How can I force Applescript to delay for a specified amount of time before moving on to the next step?  Is this a Yosemite glitch?  Is there a reliable workaround?
",2oh1,https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/50100,"@2oh1, you have the right basic idea in your answer, but here's a complete and correct answer:

The only reasonable way to work around this is to invoke ""delay"" within a loop that ensures the desired duration elapses before continuing. The best way to do this is to override ""delay"" with a custom handler:

on delay duration
  set endTime to (current date) + duration
  repeat while (current date) is less than endTime
    tell AppleScript to delay duration
  end repeat
end delay


This enables you to leave the rest of your script unchanged and you can use ""delay"" normally, e.g.,

delay 5
display alert ""I like cake!""


[NOTE: Normally, the custom handler would use ""continue delay duration"" to invoke the built-in ""delay"", but I found that, although this works within Script Editor, it returns an error when used within an applet (“Can’t continue delay. (-1708)”). I worked around that issue by directly telling AppleScript to handle the delay command instead of using ""continue"" to get there.]

The answer is roughly that LQG does not in fact violate Lorentz invariance.

660,660,1049,Oracle.DataAccess.Client.BulkCopy - trying to cast varchar2 as number when it shouldn't,"I have a table (A)  that includes a column named confirmation_number.  It is defined as a varchar2(30) and contains something like SMITERI-2012-02-31-4567.

I have another table (B) that also includes a column named confirmation_number, and it is also a varchar2(30).

I have a stored procedure that extracts the data from A, performing some transformation on it, and it includes the confirmation number column.  

I use C# and ODP.Net to run the stored procedure and load a DataTable with it.  I then perform some additional transformations.  However, I never touch the confirmation number column.

Finally, I create an OracleBulkCopy object, set the column mappings, tell it to update Table B, and call loader.WriteToServer(dataTable).

I am getting the following error:

Input string was not in a correct format.
   at System.Number.StringToNumber(String str, NumberStyles options, NumberBuffer&amp; number, NumberFormatInfo info, Boolean parseDecimal)
   at System.Number.ParseInt64(String value, NumberStyles options, NumberFormatInfo numfmt)
   at Oracle.DataAccess.Client.OracleBulkCopy.PerformBulkCopy()


I have confirmed that the error occurs on the confirmation_number column, because if I don't load that column, the dataload succeeds.

Any ideas why the BulkCopy would be trying to turn a varchar(2) into a Number?

EDIT:
I have confirmed the following relevant issues:


This is happening on more than just the confirmation number.  This
appears to only be a problem on string columns - whether from a
string to a string or a string to an integer. 
This doesn't happen on every varchar2 column - last name and first name have no trouble.
This happens both on columns that have no null values (confirmation
number) and on columns that may have null values (street type).
Investigating the contents of the datatable at the moment before the
loader begins shows no difference in column definition between those
that successfully go in and those that do not.


I'm beginning to wonder if there's a bug in the BulkCopy itself and if I need to do this load using another utility.

EDIT: 

Below is the trimmed down code.

",user158017,https://stackoverflow.com/users/158017,"It seems that BulkCopy does some sort of type conversion based on the declared types of the columns in the DataTable that it is given.

If you print the Column.DataType.ToString() for the columns that are causing issues, there is a good chance that you will see a type other than the one which the database is expecting.

You can create a new data table from the using old one but explicitly change Column.DataType of the troubling columns to be of the type that the database expects. 

public DataTable potentialFix(DataTable dt) {    
    DataTable newTable = new DataTable(dt.TableName);

    //define columns for the new table with type string (or whatever type you want)

It is defined as a varchar2(30) and contains something like SMITERI-2012-02-31-4567.

I have another table (B) that also includes a column named confirmation_number, and it is also a varchar2(30).

I have a stored procedure that extracts the data from A, performing some transformation on it, and it includes the confirmation number column.  

I use C# and ODP.Net to run the stored procedure and load a DataTable with it.  I then perform some additional transformations.  However, I never touch the confirmation number column.

Finally, I create an OracleBulkCopy object, set the column mappings, tell it to update Table B, and call loader.WriteToServer(dataTable).

I am getting the following error:

Input string was not in a correct format.
   at System.Number.StringToNumber(String str, NumberStyles options, NumberBuffer&amp; number, NumberFormatInfo info, Boolean parseDecimal)
   at System.Number.ParseInt64(String value, NumberStyles options, NumberFormatInfo numfmt)
   at Oracle.DataAccess.Client.OracleBulkCopy.PerformBulkCopy()


I have confirmed that the error occurs on the confirmation_number column, because if I don't load that column, the dataload succeeds.

Any ideas why the BulkCopy would be trying to turn a varchar(2) into a Number?

EDIT:
I have confirmed the following relevant issues:


This is happening on more than just the confirmation number.  This
appears to only be a problem on string columns - whether from a
string to a string or a string to an integer. 
This doesn't happen on every varchar2 column - last name and first name have no trouble.
This happens both on columns that have no null values (confirmation
number) and on columns that may have null values (street type).
Investigating the contents of the datatable at the moment before the
loader begins shows no difference in column definition between those
that successfully go in and those that do not.


I'm beginning to wonder if there's a bug in the BulkCopy itself and if I need to do this load using another utility.

I was using the code below to enable and disable GPS programmatically and worked perfectly in 2.2 and 2.3.

4723,4723,7495,Copy visual mode selection below selection in vi,"In vim, I often find myself repeating the same steps to copy a section before making changes to it:


V to start Visual mode linewise
j until I have selected the section I want to copy
y to yank the selection
j to scroll down to the last line of the text I just selected
p to copy the yanked section below the current line
O to start a new blank line above the copied text
ESC to leave insert mode


Is there a more efficient way to accomplish this (or any part of it)? In particular, it seems like there should be a better way to put text below the selection you just selected, rather than scrolling down to select it, yanking it, and scrolling down to the bottom again.

Here is another variant that places the copy below the original: y'}'}p.

I think that the most generic way to shorten the whole process is to extend the visual selection either:


with a search motion if you can identify a ""hook"" on the last line of the block you want to duplicate (V/foo&lt;CR&gt;)

yank (y), 
move to the end of the visual selection ('&gt; or 5j but '&gt; is more generic),

This method is probably the most generic but that's still a lot of typing. That's where mappings come to the rescue:

1034,1034,1626,call/cc implementation?,"I'm trying to find how call/cc is implemented. The best I've found is this Haskell snippet:

callCC f = Cont $ \k -&gt; runCont (f (\a -&gt; Cont $ \_ -&gt; k a)) k


Although this is not as simple as I want due to the Cont and runCont. I've also found descriptions of what it does, although never as clear as actual code.

So how is it implemented in its simplest form? I am tagging this with Scheme and Haskell as those are two languages I prefer.
",Pubby,https://stackoverflow.com/users/964135,"call/cc is trivial to implement. The hard part is setting up the environment where it is possible to implement.

We must first define a continuation-passing style (CPS) execution environment. In this environment, your functions (or function-like things) don't directly return values; instead, they are passed a function that represents the 'next step' in the computation - the 'continuation' - and they pass their result there. In Haskell, this looks like this:

newtype Cont r a = Cont { runCont :: (a -&gt; r) -&gt; r }


As you can see, a Cont monad action is really a function that takes a continuation (a -&gt; r), passes a result a to the continuation, and gets back a final result of r, which it simply passes through to its caller (ie, a Cont monad action should tail call into the continuation). runCont just takes it out of the newtype wrapper - you could also think of it as invoking an action with some particular continuation, as in runCont someAction someContinuation.

We can then turn this into a monad:

instance Monad (Cont r) where
    return x = Cont $ \cc -&gt; cc x
    (Cont f) (&gt;&gt;=) g = Cont $ \cc -&gt; f (\r -&gt; runCont (g r) cc)


As you can see, return just gets a continuation cc, and passes its value to the continuation. (&gt;&gt;=) is a bit trickier, it has to invoke f with a continuation that then invokes g, gets the action back, and then passes the outer continuation to this new action.

So given this framework, getting at the continuation is simple. We just want to invoke a function with its continuation twice. The tricky part is we need to rewrap this continuation in a new monadic action that throws out the existing continuation. So let's break it down a bit:

-- Invoke a raw continuation with a given argument, throwing away our normal 
-- continuation
gotoContinuation :: (a -&gt; r) -&gt; a -&gt; Cont r x
gotoContinuation continuation argument = Cont $ \_ -&gt; continuation argument

-- Duplicate the current continuation; wrap one up in an easy-to-use action, and
-- the other stays the normal continuation for f
callCC f = Cont $ \cc -&gt; runCont (f (gotoContinuation cc)) cc


Simple, no?

In other languages like Scheme, the principle is the same, although it may be implemented as a compiler primitive; the reason we can do it in Haskell is because the continuation-passing was something we defined in Haskell, not at a lower level of the runtime. But the principle is the same - you need to have CPS first, and then call/cc is a trivial application of this execution model.

it is not too expensive for me (less than 200$) (otherwise I would have fancied a Teenage engineering OP1;
it can be completely silent (commuting home->work->home takes quite a long time, I would like to be able to practice in crowded places (without annoying anyone);
it is extremely portable (for the above commuting);
it can be played even without being plugged to a pc (otherwise I would have chosen this korg nano keyboard);
it can study some music theory with it;
in some six months I will be able to show some decent performance with it (so to say, I hope it has a bit of depth and is not just a toy).


Since (as I said), I know nothing of music and musical instruments, I would like to have someone savvy to 'validate' my points; alternative suggestions/idead would be appreciated, too!

So it appears that he is advocating something like DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA with 1024-bit ephemeral DH keys over AES256-SHA with a 2048-bit RSA key. My understanding is that 1024-bit DH (ephemeral or not) is of comparable security to 1024-bit RSA. Why would he make such a recommendation? Does he value the forward secrecy offered by DHE that much?

50,50,77,AES using derived keys / IVs. Does it introduce a weakness?,"I'm looking for an efficient way to encrypt multiple fields in a database with AES using a single global key, used throughout a large web application.

Obviously in order to re-use this key, a unique random IV is required for each field that is to be encrypted.

I'd rather not introduce more fields to the database to store each of these IVs, so the programatic approach seems to be to derive these IVs some how.

I'm toying with using either:

key = sha256(global_key + table_name)
iv = sha256(column_name + primary_key)


Or even simply:

key = global_key
iv = sha256(table_name + column_name + primary_key)


I'm leaning towards the former to generate per-table keys.

I've already read that the IVs do not need to be kept secret. So I'm working on the assumption that a derived key or IV (even if the algorithm becomes known), is no more insecure than any other non-secret IV, as long as the original key remains secret.

The question is:

Is there a fatal flaw in my approach? Am I introducing any serious weaknesses that, in the event that an adversary obtains a copy of the database, would make it easier for them to retrieve the plaintext data?

I realise that is potentially soliciting one word answers.

Suggestions for alternate / better schemes very much welcomed, as well as references to existing works and how they implement similar scenarios.
",Leigh,https://security.stackexchange.com/users/1349,"A potentially better approach would be to store the IV and ciphertext in one column. This way, you can generate IVs in the way most appropriate for your choice of encryption mode while also not having to add columns.

Something like ""$AES-128-CBC$"" + Base64.encode64(iv) + ""$"" + Base64.encode64(ciphertext) is similar to the format used in crypt, easily parseable, and being Base64-encoded is slightly more convenient when doing queries on the database using command-line clients.

  Possible Duplicate:
  Why avoid increment (&ldquo;++&rdquo;) and decrement (&ldquo;--&rdquo;) operators in JavaScript?  




I'm a big fan of Douglas Crockford and his excellent book, JavaScript: The Good Parts. I also use his JSLint tool on an hourly basis before checking in any code to our repository, as is good sense.

One thing I've noticed when running code through JSLint is its insistence that the ++ increment operator is somehow evil. I know I can turn certain rules off, but that's cheating ;). Crockford mentions his dislike on page 112 of JS: TGP...


  In my own practice, I observed that when I used ++ and --, my code tended to be too tight, too tricky, too cryptic. So, as a matter of discipline, I don't use them any more. I think that as a result, my coding style has become cleaner.


That's all very lovely, but he doesn't give any examples of the way he codes them now. I assume he's doing something like...

var i;
i = 0;
i = i + 1;


Again, great, but I've got a few basic 'for loops' in my JS code, as I imagine many people have, and I've always used the standard syntax...

for (i = 0; i &lt; myArray.length; i++) { 
    // Loop Stuff 
}


Am I missing something? What's the cleanest and/or best way to increment/decrement?

This seems straight forward, but I am getting connection refused exceptions and I'm not sure why. 

Here is the model from my Mule configuration file:

&lt;model name=""ProxySample""&gt;
    &lt;service name=""HttpProxyService""&gt;
        &lt;inbound&gt;
            &lt;http:inbound-endpoint address=""http://localhost:8787"" synchronous=""true""/&gt;

&lt;/model&gt;


I am browsing to http://localhost:8787/my-site in my browser, thinking that it will route to http://server2.xyz.com:8080/my-site, but I get a connection refused error.

3673,3673,5856,Shape of rotating rope (lasso problem?),"Let's take a wire or a rope. I usually do this with a chain or my scarf.

I fixate one end in my hand and apply rotation (by subtle movements of this endpoint like spinning a lasso). The rope gets into rotation and obtains certain bent shape:


Some part is missing because cellphone cameras ain't great for high-speed photos but I hope you can imagine all the scarf.

The question is: how can I calculate/predict this shape?

Although this problem doesn't seem that bizarre, I have never seen any solution. Nor I have found this question asked anywhere on internet... Must be because I just don't know how to formulate it without pictures.

Also by taking longer rope I get more than one bend:


I apoligize for the quality again. It is even harder to rotate this while taking picture. The form is not spiral, it is more like a shape in a plane that's rotating.

I'll be thankful for explanations, solutions, links or at least a correct formulation of this problem.

5948,5948,9424,"iPhone dock connector problems, with and without accessories","I started to experience problems with my iPhone that seem to be related to the dock connector.

Upon plugging my iPhone into my (officially supported) car stereo, I started to get the message  ""This accessory is not supported by iPhone"" on the screen.  Didn't think much of it as I only use it for charging purposes, and that still worked so I ignored it.  Then I bought a small ANT+ dongle, which is a little accessory you plug into the dock connector to allow your phone to receive data from various health/fitness devices like heart rate monitor, and cycle sensors etc.  It produces the same error message every time I plug it in, and the apps that use the dongle will not recognise it.

The dongle does officially support my hardware and OS level. I've checked that it is not broken by plugging it into an iPhone 5, an iPad 3 and an iPod of some description, none of which showed the error.  The supported apps find the device on the iPad, the iPhone 5 does not have the apps installed but offers to do so as soon as I plug it in, so I know the dongle is working correctly.

In addition to the above, when nothing is plugged into the dock connector, it still occassionally thinks that something is, resulting in a muted phone.  When it's in this state I am not able to hear anything or change any volume settings (music playback or ringer volume) with the physical keys. Going into the Music app shows that it thinks it's outputting the music to the dock connector.

473,473,737,What are lightbox / modal window UI best practices for viewing full-sized images in a gallery?,"I'm an artist and amateur web designer.

On my portfolio website, I've grouped my work into projects. Most of my projects contain few (20 or less) images, so I just display them in full size and let the visitor scroll (example) because this is how I prefer to browse other artist's work as well.

For projects containing more images, I use thumbnails which link to the full-sized images, because, again, when I browse other artist's portfolios, if there are lots of images on a page it's kinda cumbersome to load. 

Recently I wrote some jQuery to implement a lightbox effect (modal window overlay) so when you click on a thumbnail, the full-sized image appears (example).

My main reasons for implementing this:


it's much more presentable than having a direct link to the image,
which is what I used to do
if the visitor shares the image on something like tumblr or
Pinterest, the link back will be to the project page instead of a
direct link to the image
if the visitor wants to right-click on the thumbnails to load several
images in several new browser tabs/windows, they can still do so (the
lightbox is triggered on left click)


I did not include a close button because it seems like more work for the visitor to have to look for a close button, than to simply click anywhere to close the lightbox (which is what I did).

What are your thoughts regarding lightbox interface for this particular use?
The goal would be the best way to showcase visual art/design work, and the target audience would be, well, anyone who wants to view the work. The display method, in this case a lightbox interface, should be efficient, useable, and presentable (it should highlight, not detract from, the work).

321,321,515,"Control Fields vs Heap ""Mock"" Fields for Branching Trigger Behavior","I've seen solutions that talk about adding control fields to allow for clever trigger branching in problems like this. I know that works, but it annoys me (feels architecturally wrong) to create such fields if it can be avoided. I've also seen solutions that have to do with using static variables for a similar purpose, but I have found occasions where one global flag is not good enough because I need the flag per record. I've tried both out and I think I want something in the middle. Something like this:

global without sharing class HeapControl {
    private static Map&lt;Id, Set&lt;String&gt;&gt; recordTags = new Map&lt;Id, Set&lt;String&gt;&gt;();
    public static void AddRecordTag(Id rowId, String tag) {
        if (recordTags.containsKey(rowId)) {
            Set&lt;String&gt; tagsForThisRow = recordTags.get(rowId);
            if (!tagsForThisRow.contains(tag)) {
                tagsForThisRow.add(tag);
            }
        } else {
            recordTags.put(rowId, new Set&lt;String&gt; { tag });
        }
    }
    public static boolean IsRecordTagged(Id rowId, String tag) {
        if (recordTags.containsKey(rowId)) {
            Set&lt;String&gt; tagsForThisRow = recordTags.get(rowId);
            if (tagsForThisRow.contains(tag)) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }

    @IsTest 
    public static void HeapDemo() {
        Account a = new Account(Name = 'Testing');
        insert a;
        HeapControl.AddRecordTag(a.Id, 'Control-Field-Name-1');
        a.Name = 'Testing2';
        update a;
        // A trigger that fired on Account Update could check the HeapControl for the record like this
        system.assert(HeapControl.IsRecordTagged(a.Id, 'Control-Field-Name-1'));
    }
}


I'd like a pro-con analysis of using real control fields vs mock control fields on the heap (doesn't have to be my code, anything along the lines of static Map&lt;Id, ...&gt;, if you know of a field-tested version of this code please share). 

In my not-yet-field-tested opinion, the control field concept evolved out of a workflow world, but once you decide to drop down to triggers the heap will serve you better--at least you don't have to create control fields for every little trigger branch.

I apologize this isn't standard Q&amp;A format--but this issue has been burning in my mind for months now and I think there are a lot of Salesforce developers (writing business process triggers in particular) that wrestle with this regularly. Thanks in advance for sharing your wisdom and experience!

3502,3502,5583,How was the sword of Gryffindor pulled from the hat a second time?,"Spoilers follow, and this is from the books (not the movies)...

In The Chamber of Secrets:


   Harry retrieves Goderic Gryffindor's sword from the sorting hat during the confrontation with the basilisk. After this Dumbledore keeps hold of the sword in a glass case in his office. 


Then in The Deathly Hallows:


   Harry and Ron do a deal with Griphook to return Gryffindor's sword to the goblins after they have retrieved Hufflepuff's cup, planning to partially double cross him by holding on to it until all the horcruxes have been destroyed. However Griphook double crosses them first, and keeps hold of the sword.


Then, in the battle at the end of the book:


   Voldemort puts the sorting hat on Neville Longbottom's head and sets him on fire. Instead of burning Neville pulls Gryffindor's sword out of the sorting hat and beheads Nagini, destroying Voldemort's last horcrux.


However, if the sword could always be pulled out of the hat by someone sufficiently heroic then why the need to:


   Create a copy of the sword to fool Bellatrix Lestrange into thinking she had the real one in Gringott's vault? Why forge a copy and risk Snape placing it in the lake if it could always have been pulled from the sorting hat, regardless of where it was or how it was protected?


How was Gryffindor's sword pulled from the hat the second time? Surely it was beyond the reach of accio or any other charms once returned to its goblin creators?

1741,1741,2752,How can I tell if a downloaded ISO is complete?,"I just ran into a nasty problem with an ISO download from Microsoft.  I successfully burnt it to a rewritable DVD, and copied the contents to the local hard drive on another machine, but when I went to run them they were corrupt.  It turns out the download had been truncated.

Now, OK, sometimes that happens - but it surprised me that the truncated file (which was only slightly more than 60% of the actual ISO) burnt successfully and seemed to be presenting me with a sensible file system, to the extent that I could (apparently) successfully copy the files.

So, is there some way I could have tested the file to see if it was complete or not?  The MS web site did not provide any information about the expected size, so I'm looking for a generic solution: given an ISO file which may or may not be truncated, is there some way to tell?  Do commonly used CD/DVD (data) formats include any embedded information about how much data is supposed to be on the disk, or even better, some kind of CRC?

A solution that detects most truncated images will be accepted, it doesn't need to be perfect.  (I'd prefer something that doesn't give false positives, though.)

[Addendum: a comparison of the disk burnt with the truncated image with the files extracted from the full image suggests that chunks of the data from many of the files were replaced with random information, perhaps from the contents of a previous burn to the same rewritable disk.]

3168,3168,5045,Another instructor is pushing me out of the classroom right after my class ends,"I am a graduate student in math in my final year, and for several years have been teaching at my department as a lecturer. This semester, in the same lecture hall there is another lecture that starts 20 minutes after my class ends. It's taught by another instructor from my department. I usually have many students coming to office hours and there are also students asking questions immediately after lecture. Due to other activities, I cannot have office hours right after the lecture this semester and can only stay for about 15 minutes to answer questions.

Many times in the past I had a similar situation and never had any issues with it. This semester the instructor who is teaching right after often arrives 20-15 minutes before her class starts and tells me immediately that I have to go with my students somewhere else. 

I make sure to leave the blackboard clean and take all my stuff away from the instructor's desk before she arrives, but I do believe that I have a right to stay in the classroom after my lecture for at least 5-10 minutes. There is no vacant classroom around, and I don't have time to go with students to my office, which is in a different building.

Last time the instructor told me in front of my students that I don't understand ""simple things"" and that I am ""playing games"". When I was talking to one of my students, she stood very close to us and clearly demonstrated that she wanted us out. I tried to explain her that I couldn't go anywhere else due to my time constraints, but she didn't want to listen to me. I really don't understand what ""simple"" things she meant and what ""games"" I am playing. 

We leave the board clean. She doesn't need to set up a projector. She can still talk to her students before her class starts, if she wants to (even though it seems like her students don't ask her any questions before their class). So, I don't see how I cause any disruption. 

I had met this woman many times before this semester, but we never talked. I didn't see her talking to other instructors/students much, and she seems to be quite reserved and a bit neurotic. She doesn't want to have any conversation with me regarding the issue.

I felt really offended after last class when she said those things to me in front of my students. What would you do in my case? 

Added later: There are no official rules regarding classroom occupancy between classes. Instructors are supposed to use common sense and be reasonable. For me using 50% of the break time seems reasonable to answer questions after lecture seems reasonable. I agree that for some people it may not.

I don't block the entrance to the classroom. A few students from the next class who come earlier always go ahead and take their seats as soon as my students start leaving the room. I also had one of the students from the next class listening to my explanation to one of those after-class questions and asking me further questions before their class (which is the same class as I am teaching, just a different section). Maybe the instructor got jealous, I don't know.

The entrance to the classroom is from its front (not back), so I do stay in the front. But it is a big lecture hall, and there is a plenty of space in front of the room (the board itself consists of 8 huge panels).

Also, during my career as a grad.student who is also teaching for the department, I have had several observations from experienced professors who are considered to be great teachers at the department and are in charge of undergraduate teaching policy. In my evaluations the fact that there are always several students approaching me with questions after class considered as very positive, meaning that students find me approachable. 

Thank you everyone for answers.

This is painfully slow:

SELECT * FROM Families

Example 2

This is faster:

SELECT * FROM Families
WHERE NOT EXISTS(SELECT * FROM Children WHERE Children.Gender=""m"" AND Children.FamilyID = Families.FamilyID)

149,149,236,Why did Voldemort assume that no-one knew about Room of Hidden Things?,"Voldemort hid one of his Horcruxes inside Hogwarts. It seemed to be relying on security through obscurity as far as protecting it. But as we know, it ended up not being so secure because it wasn't so obscure - Harry Potter knew about the Room of Hidden Things.

My question is, the way Rowling describes this hints at the fact that Riddle had an assumption that very few people would ever stumble upon that room. *WHY???



First, let's show Harry's theory on what Voldemort was thinking, how and why:

Here's Harry understanding Voldemort's thinking in HP7 once he figured out where the Diadem was (bold emphasis mine):


  Tom Riddle, who confided in no one and operated alone, might have been arrogant
  enough to assume that he, and only he, had penetrated the deepest mysteries of
  Hogwarts Castle. Of course, Dumbledore and Flitwick, those model pupils, had never
  set foot in that particular place, but he, Harry, had strayed off the beaten track in his
  time at school – here at least was a secret area he and Voldemort knew, that
  Dumbledore had never discovered –


...and later on, with Harry explains the location to Ron/Hermione:


  “He hid it exactly where I had my old Potions book, where everyone’s been hiding stuff for centuries. He thought he was the only one to find it. Come on.”
  
  “And he never realized anyone could get in?” said Ron, his voice echoing in the silence.
  “He thought he was the only one,” said Harry.


.



Yet, from available evidence, that seems to be a completely wrong assumption, even at Voldemort's time. 

Let's examine that last quote again, with emphasis on other info available:


  “He hid it exactly where I had my old Potions book, where everyone’s been hiding stuff for centuries.” ...
  
  ...
  
  “And he never realized anyone could get in?” said Ron, his voice echoing in the silence.
  “He thought he was the only one,” said Harry. “Too bad for him I’ve had to hide stuff in
  my time... this way,” he added. “I think it’s down here... “ 
  
  They sped off up adjacent aisles; Harry could hear the others’ footsteps echoing through the towering piles of junk, of bottles, hats, crates, chairs, books, weapons, broomsticks, bats...


.

OK, so if there's a truckload (or train-load, by the description) of stuff in that room, isn't the only reasonable conclusion: ""the room is a fairly popular destination with plenty of people who've found their way there in the past, and therefore, likely, plenty who will in the future""? 

Doesn't matter what your arrogance level is, the evidence seems to point to only one conclusion - it's quite fine as a place to temporarily bury your dirt so teachers won't tag you for your misdeeds, but this is NOT the place to hide something that you want permanently safe! 

So why did Voldemort make such a moronic mistake?
",DVK-on-Ahch-To,https://scifi.stackexchange.com/users/976,"Voldemort knew other people knew about the room, he must have, considering it is written in the book the history of Hogwarts, which Hermione points out. He knew this, and so used the room to hide the horcrux. Like someone said earlier, how many people are going to accidentally find the room of requirement, accidentally find the diadem and accidentally destroy it? Not many, I'm guessing.

Also, as Cho points out, the diadem has been lost for centuries, and no living person has seen it (which isn't technically correct, as Voldemort had seen it, but anyway...). This means that even if someone saw it, they wouldn't think it was the lost diadem.

The 'truck load' of stuff in the room may not have necessarily been hidden by students. Someone needs a place to hide their stuff, you are hardly going to be shown a plain room, with nothing to hide the object in. All the other items have probably been created by the room to help the student hide the item.

I've installed a cruise control kit in my car, and I want to use a set of Honda steering wheel controls instead of the stock controls from the kit.  The cruise kit controls are expecting 12 volts, but I'm not comfortable running any more than 5 volts through the small steering wheel wires next to the airbag wiring.  I'd prefer even less, like 2-3 volts.

So I need to build a switching circuit that will provide the 12 volt signals to the cruise kit.  I was thinking of keeping it solid-state, since I don't know of any relays that will switch on 2-3 volts.  However, if there's a good reason to use relays then I can.

What's happening is that when the extension is loaded, no music plays. When you click it, it starts playing and everything's fine. When you click it again, it stops for a couple of seconds then starts playing again. I need it to stop until you click it again.

2928,2928,4661,How can I build a switching circuit that scales several 12v signals down to <5v?,"Let me start off by saying that I know just enough about electronics to be dangerous (how to solder, follow a simple schematic, and check for connectivity problems and usually figure out what each wire is for).

I've installed a cruise control kit in my car, and I want to use a set of Honda steering wheel controls instead of the stock controls from the kit.  The cruise kit controls are expecting 12 volts, but I'm not comfortable running any more than 5 volts through the small steering wheel wires next to the airbag wiring.  I'd prefer even less, like 2-3 volts.

So I need to build a switching circuit that will provide the 12 volt signals to the cruise kit.  I was thinking of keeping it solid-state, since I don't know of any relays that will switch on 2-3 volts.  However, if there's a good reason to use relays then I can.

Here's a rough drawing of what I need:



How can I get started with this project?
",jnylen,https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/1610,"To answer your question, you just need to convert the low voltage to a high voltage by use of a transistor switch. Using a BJT transistor will work, but I recommend using a MOSFET. They are more efficient and can handle more power without getting hot due to the very low ""on"" resistance. Consider this circuit:



The P channel MOSFET gate is pulled HI by RA, so it is turned ""OFF."" Remember, P channel transistors (or PNP) work opposite to that of N channel transistors (OR NPN). Since the FET is OFF, the outputs signal is pulled LO by RB.

If a switch is closed/pressed, then the FET gate is LO, turning the FET ""ON."" Now, the transistor acts like a switch, connecting the output to the 12V power source. There is a bit of loss in the transistor, but not a lot. Using a ""Power MOSFET"" is necessary to handle the level of current required to operate an automotive relay - not a problem since many of these transistors can switch dozens of amps.

Since the MOSFET is a voltage controlled device, only a negligible amount of current would be needed to control the transistor (this is the current through your steering wheel wires). A similar circuit could be made using an N channel MOSFET instead. See this website on using a MOSFET as a switch:

http://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/transistor/tran_7.html

But realistically, this is all probably unnecessary. Have a look at the wire gauge table on this website:

3234,3234,5157,How should hands that are EXTREMELY strong in one suit (10+ cards) be bid?,"I'm a bit of a bridge noob, but I'm kind of puzzled about this. Say I have a hand that is ridiculously strong in one suit, say at least 10 cards with all 4 honors (I'll use spades for the example suit). how should I bid? This is so many cards that almost nobody will be leading spades but me, so if another suit is trump, I'm flush out of luck.

Obviously I would want to end up playing a spade contract with a good potential for a slam, but if I open too high, say 5 spades, won't my opponents catch on pretty quickly and bid in their own suits or No-trump, just so my spades will be next to useless? They will likely have favorable distributions for their own suits since nearly all the spades are gone, which only worsens the fact. Then again, if I bid to low, my partner may not rebid, and while taking 12 tricks at a contract of 3S is obviously good, knowing you will have that many overtricks from the start seems kind of a waste.

Even if I held 12 or 13 spades, if I bid 7S, won't my opponents just bid 7NT and I'll never get to lead? How should hands with this heavy a distribution be bid to make the most of them?

(I've already said I'm not a very experienced bridge player, so if I'm making any glaring oversights don't hesitate in the slightest to bring them up.)



NOTE: I know these hands are extremely rare, but in all reality, every single possible hand is rare enough that studying bridge hands is actually quite useless because you'll never see the same hand again in your life...but we do it anyway because that's how we learn.

If you aren't part of one of these groups or you joined them after already being enrolled in the Social Security system (i.e. paid FICA taxes, etc.), you don't have to take Social Security payments, but you are not exempt from FICA payroll taxes. This means that you can't simply become Amish and be exempt if you've already paid into the system.

Many of these answers were listed here, but the only stated source is ""Wikipedia,"" so take it with a grain of salt. I've tried to provide other sources where I could. 

Ministers/religious officials

I mentioned that the situation with ministers and/or religious officials is more complicated. Among other things, these officials need to certify that they are religiously opposed to receiving public insurance benefits and they have to file by a certain deadline soon after earning a certain amount as a minister. Furthermore, if you file this exemption and choose/chose to revoke it later on, e.g. by filing IRS Form 2031, during the short time windows when this is possible, you're no longer eligible to file for another exemption. Once you revoke your exemption, you won't get another one. 

Also note that this opt-out only applies to income earned as part of your ministry. For non-ministerial income, you're still required to pay FICA taxes even if you follow the procedure(s) above.

If you do opt-out

Clearly, opting out of the Social Security isn't easy, or even feasible, for many people, but if you are outside the system, common sense dictates that you should insure yourself against risks that would usually be covered, at least in part, by Social Security. Dave Ramsey maintains a list of such investments that he recommends ministers and religious officials who opt out of the Social Security system should purchase, but the rationale applies to anyone who isn't part of the system. 


Term life insurance that covers 10x your annual income. Normally, your spouse or dependents will receive a Social Security death benefit upon your death, but if you opt-out, your family doesn't have this option. Since the death benefit is a pittance ($255), however, you may want life insurance regardless of your participation in Social Security.
Long-term disability insurance. If you become disabled, you won't receive disability benefits, so you'll may want insurance to cover this risk.
Long-term care insurance. Similar to disability insurance, you may want additional income to cover you in case you require long-term care, and Medicaid isn't enough.
Other retirement savings. If you're not going to be paying money into Social Security, it makes sense to invest that money in some form of tax-advantaged or tax-sheltered retirement account to ensure that you still have some income in retirement. You won't be receiving Social Security checks, but you'll still need income.


Depending on your circumstances, it's may be a good idea to invest in some or all of these instruments anyway (especially tax-advantaged/tax-sheltered retirement accounts), because Social Security doesn't cover 100% of the risks you'll face, but that decision is highly specific to each person/family.

Paying Social Security taxes is mandatory, however. Even if your income exceeds the means testing limits, you are still required to pay Social security (FICA) taxes on the income that falls beneath it. 

That being said, there are several groups that are exempt from paying Social Security taxes, based on what I can scrounge up through online searching.

4198,4198,6693,"Control Fields vs Heap ""Mock"" Fields for Branching Trigger Behavior","I've seen solutions that talk about adding control fields to allow for clever trigger branching in problems like this. I know that works, but it annoys me (feels architecturally wrong) to create such fields if it can be avoided. I've also seen solutions that have to do with using static variables for a similar purpose, but I have found occasions where one global flag is not good enough because I need the flag per record. I've tried both out and I think I want something in the middle. Something like this:

global without sharing class HeapControl {
    private static Map&lt;Id, Set&lt;String&gt;&gt; recordTags = new Map&lt;Id, Set&lt;String&gt;&gt;();
    public static void AddRecordTag(Id rowId, String tag) {
        if (recordTags.containsKey(rowId)) {
            Set&lt;String&gt; tagsForThisRow = recordTags.get(rowId);
            if (!tagsForThisRow.contains(tag)) {
                tagsForThisRow.add(tag);
            }
        } else {
            recordTags.put(rowId, new Set&lt;String&gt; { tag });
        }
    }
    public static boolean IsRecordTagged(Id rowId, String tag) {
        if (recordTags.containsKey(rowId)) {
            Set&lt;String&gt; tagsForThisRow = recordTags.get(rowId);
            if (tagsForThisRow.contains(tag)) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }

    @IsTest 
    public static void HeapDemo() {
        Account a = new Account(Name = 'Testing');
        insert a;
        HeapControl.AddRecordTag(a.Id, 'Control-Field-Name-1');
        a.Name = 'Testing2';
        update a;
        // A trigger that fired on Account Update could check the HeapControl for the record like this
        system.assert(HeapControl.IsRecordTagged(a.Id, 'Control-Field-Name-1'));
    }
}


I'd like a pro-con analysis of using real control fields vs mock control fields on the heap (doesn't have to be my code, anything along the lines of static Map&lt;Id, ...&gt;, if you know of a field-tested version of this code please share). 

In my not-yet-field-tested opinion, the control field concept evolved out of a workflow world, but once you decide to drop down to triggers the heap will serve you better--at least you don't have to create control fields for every little trigger branch.

I apologize this isn't standard Q&amp;A format--but this issue has been burning in my mind for months now and I think there are a lot of Salesforce developers (writing business process triggers in particular) that wrestle with this regularly. Thanks in advance for sharing your wisdom and experience!
",twamley,https://salesforce.stackexchange.com/users/773,"Good quesiton, but what is the real question? The key phrase from your question for me is 'business process triggers'. If I may, I think the discussion needs to start from a application layering perspective, or put more specifically 'where do we put our business process logic?'. Before I get on to that let me say this about triggers...

The thing about triggers is... they respond to data centric actions, period. If you view the top to bottom architecture of your Force.com application, its easy to forget your still dealing with the database tier when writing code at the trigger level. If you look at the rich level of API support and an native UI around this database tier. You will soon realise your effectively developing an app on a database schema that is by default open, like it or not. You have to service this way of interacting with your app. Take Salesforce Touch for example, this provides your clients a rich mobile/tablet client for free! Then the new REST API, the list goes on. You only get the benefit of these if you embrace letting your customers / developers access this tier safely and clearly (so good database design is even more important ironically). So when you look at it from this angle, its important to consider carefully any requirements that lead to design patterns, validation rules etc that might impact the use of your 'open database tier'. And don't get me wrong, there are some good reasons to, but you must design firstly for things to be open and discuss carefully what the implications are of over complicating or closing off parts of your database schema interaction.

So that all sounds good, but why do I still find it hard sometimes to implement what I want? Well, if your application is typically ""data centric"" in its purpose, you'll generally have an easier job. A user interactions, much like Salesforce CRM, are typically tasks surrounding the scope and lifetime of individual records. So triggers, layouts, record types really start to come into their own here. But if you have an application that is in part 'data centric' (for standing / master data) and part 'process/task centric' where does that leave you? Enter SOA...

Service Orientated Architecture and Control Fields? Unless you're solely a data centric application. Your going to have to find a place for your clients (and by 'clients' I am not just talking about human consumers here) to consume / access your business process logic. Having them tweak Control Fields at your schema level may make sense and there is scope for it, if you can work it nicely into the schema. But over use of it, along with having your clients dependent on a deeper understanding of your schema. Will introduce voodoo into your schema and increase the barrier to entry for your application interactions, developer, end user or platform wise. So to avoid users poking around trying to reverse engineer your VF logic, control fields, why not consider exposing a service layer in your applications for such logic? 

So how do I do that then? REST has recently taken hold over Web Services, primarily because of the aforementioned 'barrier to entry'. It is easy to document and if done correctly is self describing, much like the 'data centric' aspects of your application utilising Custom Objects. So for business proceses, for me REST (I include JavaScript Remoting in this) gets my vote for exposing business process logic to your clients (be they human or machine). If you adhere strictly to this approach (which requires a SOA based design process for your app) then you'll end up with a rich set of API's for you and your clients to consume. Which in this day and age of Cloud computing is pretty much a must! So while you might argue this is not strictly SOA (as yes Salesforce does handle a lot of the mechanics with oAuth etc). I feel there is room for taking a SOA based design and architecture approach to designing Force.com applications.

So OK, how would I implement the code in the question above? Developing a generic Apex solution is really a solution for a problem that I don't think should be solved generically or at the Apex level (see my thoughts below). Generally to much of this approach is teaching your database tier code
about the business processes that should be implemented above it. You should let your business process tier do the driving and expose that as a service for your clients / callers to consume (in addition to those already provided by Salesforce btw!). The trick then is marketing and supporting the strict design, development and consumption internally (for your own client developers, be they VF, mobile or otherwise) and externally of them. Again don't get me wrong we should absolutely fill our triggers with great value add logic, but it should know its place.

Control Fields : Heap vs Custom Field : That said, when taking the Control Field approach, and as I describe above is valid, when it 'fits' with your schema and thus API / native UI experience sensibly. When implementing it I am in favour in the first instance of designing it in into the application schema as a field. This way everyone knows whats going on. Again the schema is open and not declaring it (by managing internally) only leads to frustration, low barrier to entry due to higher complexity (internally and externally). I've also been burnt a few times with Static, initialisation and state carry over, while I'm not 100% sure, for example, I think Batch Apex serialises statics over 'execute' invocations, which can catch you out at times.

Application Enterprise Patterns on Force.com

Here is a diagram i presented at a recent Dreamforce session about Enterprise Application patterns. The sessions slides takes a simple scenario and walks through, what might be described as a 'consolidated' or 'merged' approach typically seen when people start out or smaller applications, and again this approach has its place as well. What I followed this in my session with was a more layered approach using some Application Enterprise patterns along the way. I'm pleased to say it got quite a good reception and has since generated a steady stream of interest (I've got a draft blog posting on it in the working btw). You can find the Github repo here, with more info on the patterns. The slides are here.



NOTE: That Trigger invocation is not shown here, the SObjectDomain class takes care of routing the CRUD events from the triggers to the 'Domain' classes representing the Standard or Custom Object behaviour your application is implementing. This pattern enforces development of appropriate logic for this context. Leaving the Service layer to doing any process level orchestration.

  ..The minhag is to recite it within 3 days of the incident after krias hatorah, though it may be recited later if necessary (Shulchan Aruch OC 219:6; Mishna Berura 20).
  
  The Chayei Adam (after 69) wrote a prayer after surviving an explosion. He writes that one should say this, along with the pesukim of the korban toda and give charity equal to the value of the animal he would have brought in Temple times. (See Mishna Berura 218:31).
  
  While women would also bring korbanei todah, the custom developed among many Ashkenazi communities that women don’t say the beracha, as the public recital is deemed immodest. The Magen Avraham (OC 219:4) writes that her husband should recite it on her behalf, while the Mishna Berura says that she recites it in front of ten women and a man. The Aruch Hashulchan (OC 219:6) suggests that this custom may have developed because women weren’t always present for Leining. Nonetheless, the Baer Hetev (219:1), Chayei Adam (65:6), Yechave Daas (4:15) and others all allow a woman to say it loudly from her side of the mechitza. Thus, Sefardi women should only say it in the presence of a minyan.
  
  In what is likely the last teshuva R’ Moshe Feinstein ever wrote (OC 5:14), he paskens that a new mother should recite the beracha in front of another, ideally her husband, and there is no need for a minyan.

What do you need to know to do this? Specifically:,"As for women 'bentsching gomel', Dose of Halacha writes:


  ..The minhag is to recite it within 3 days of the incident after krias hatorah, though it may be recited later if necessary (Shulchan Aruch OC 219:6; Mishna Berura 20).
  
  The Chayei Adam (after 69) wrote a prayer after surviving an explosion. He writes that one should say this, along with the pesukim of the korban toda and give charity equal to the value of the animal he would have brought in Temple times. (See Mishna Berura 218:31).
  
  While women would also bring korbanei todah, the custom developed among many Ashkenazi communities that women don’t say the beracha, as the public recital is deemed immodest. The Magen Avraham (OC 219:4) writes that her husband should recite it on her behalf, while the Mishna Berura says that she recites it in front of ten women and a man. The Aruch Hashulchan (OC 219:6) suggests that this custom may have developed because women weren’t always present for Leining. Nonetheless, the Baer Hetev (219:1), Chayei Adam (65:6), Yechave Daas (4:15) and others all allow a woman to say it loudly from her side of the mechitza. Thus, Sefardi women should only say it in the presence of a minyan.
  
  In what is likely the last teshuva R’ Moshe Feinstein ever wrote (OC 5:14), he paskens that a new mother should recite the beracha in front of another, ideally her husband, and there is no need for a minyan.

1957,1957,3118,How to interpret a Current Value into a PWM signal percentage?,"I have a maltab model, output of which (from an RL circuit) is a value for current.

The $uud$ proton and $udd$ neutron are both spin 1/2, implying that two of their spin 1/2 quarks are always parallel and the other is always opposed.

In contrast, the $\Delta^+$ particle (which like the proton is $uud$) and the $\Delta^0$ particle (which like the neutron is $udd$) are both spin 3/2, implying presumably that the same principle keeps their internal quark spins all parallel.

What principle keeps trios of quarks aligned or anti-aligned in such specific ways?

Now also suppose that, at the same moment, his teacher (or another prominent Torah scholar to whom he is obligated to show respect) passes by. He'll be caught in a dilemma: if he takes the time to greet them respectfully, as he should, then the deal will be final and he'll be unable to retract; on the other hand, it's disrespectful to finish his business and only then to acknowledge them. The solution? Allow him the time it takes to greet them with ""shalom alecha rabi (umori),"" and to still be able to cancel the deal immediately thereafter.

Right now tweet keywords are done using the ILIKE query.

This works pretty well if the keyword i'm looking for is a commonly used word, like 'love' , 'friend', 'OMG', etc. but less common words like ""geospatial"" need to search through a lot more data in order to find the last n instances of the word. This is dead slow.

To combat my slowness I'm building a GIN index on my tweet field in postgres. Two days later and i'm still waiting for the index to complete. Once it's built though, I'll try a few queries using SQL view parameters and hopefully this will dramatically speed things up.

Even if this approach works though, it's not going to be all that useful if the index takes so long to create -- the maintenance of it will not be able to keep up will the incoming flood of data. I think I will try out the GiST index next and see how long it takes as I understand it is much faster to this build index.

Note that I have tens of other similar filters that do properly match mail per address. It is only this one address / filter combination that is failing to match mail.

To proactively address the obvious red herrings and ensure that the discussion remains focused: I am aware of the dangers of posting a live email address publicly. I am aware of Gmail's excellent spam filters. I am aware of the arguments against catch-all email addresses.

4170,4170,6648,"iPhone dock connector problems, with and without accessories","I started to experience problems with my iPhone that seem to be related to the dock connector.

Upon plugging my iPhone into my (officially supported) car stereo, I started to get the message  ""This accessory is not supported by iPhone"" on the screen.  Didn't think much of it as I only use it for charging purposes, and that still worked so I ignored it.  Then I bought a small ANT+ dongle, which is a little accessory you plug into the dock connector to allow your phone to receive data from various health/fitness devices like heart rate monitor, and cycle sensors etc.  It produces the same error message every time I plug it in, and the apps that use the dongle will not recognise it.

The dongle does officially support my hardware and OS level. I've checked that it is not broken by plugging it into an iPhone 5, an iPad 3 and an iPod of some description, none of which showed the error.  The supported apps find the device on the iPad, the iPhone 5 does not have the apps installed but offers to do so as soon as I plug it in, so I know the dongle is working correctly.

In addition to the above, when nothing is plugged into the dock connector, it still occassionally thinks that something is, resulting in a muted phone.  When it's in this state I am not able to hear anything or change any volume settings (music playback or ringer volume) with the physical keys. Going into the Music app shows that it thinks it's outputting the music to the dock connector.

Why is this accessory not working on my iPhone, and how can I get it working?  What causes my iPhone to think that it's docked when it isn't?
",stuffe,https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/9495,"This commonly occurs when there is an issue with your dock connector.  It is likely dirty, obstructed in some way, or possibly even broken with a bent pin or something.  Very often this is not apparent, because with 30 pins to play with, chances are most of the time you only need the ones for charging and USB data transfer, leaving the rest unused such that you will not notice if they start working sub optimally.

There are 3 ways I would try to fix this, in order of most likely to fix:

Clear it out

Your first step is to check for any obvious blockage.  If  you have a can of compressed air, you can try to blow any debris out.  If you don't, then using a fine non metallic scraper (a plastic toothpick is ideal, a wooden one may leave small fibers behind) carefully clean out what you can - even if it looks clean you will be surprised how much crap and fluff you can scrape out. Take care to blow any debris out of the phone, and not into it - i.e. hold it upright and get at it from underneath, don't sit it upside down and work from the top

Clean it up

If there is no obvious obstruction then the problem may be more subtle, a coating on one or more of the pins that is preventing a neat conductive contact, or is grounding a pin against another one for example - perhaps there has been some contact with a liquid in the past etc.  You need to clean the pins to get rid of this.  You will need a couple of things things - 1) some cleaning agent, 2) a lint free cloth/piece of sponge, or an old toothbrush.

For a cleaning agent, 99% isopropyl is perfect, but if you don't have that kicking around you could try a very small quantity of the neatest and purest alcoholic drink you have in the house - I've used Vodka which is by and large 50/50 alcohol and water.  Don't use anything flavoured or anything that it likely to have anything other than alcohol and water in it!  Especially sugars or salt!.

Using a very small amount of your cleaning agent, and keeping the phone upright so any drips fall out, and not into the phone, lightly brush or wipe the dock connector, taking care not to be rough enough to disturb the pins out of alignment.  I've used a small piece of synthetic sponge and prodded it about with the same toothpick I used earlier.

Hit it

If this doesn't work, then the issue could still be a physical obstruction, although it may be beyond the dock connector and more internal.  Short of taking the phone to bits, there is not a lot you can do, and whilst you cannot clean the inside, you can try to dislodge anything that's stuck by using a combination of lightly tapping the phone on all 4 sides whilst playing about with the vibrate functions for alarms etc.



Using the first 2 methods above I solved the ""Accessory not supported problem"", but still had the intermittent docking issue.

Assuming I could not fix that one, I went to turn on Vibrate alerts (which I had previously turned off) as a workaround, only to find that after playing with all the vibrate ""tones"" etc it magically fixed itself!


Note 1 It's possible that the issue is not with the connector on your phone, but on your device/cable - you can try all the above on the cable end too if doing it on your phone does not yield results.
Note 2 If your device is failing to charge, or will only charge from a certain cable or dock, then the same fix potentially applies.

I created a libraries folder within my module's folder within the third_party folder.

I named the file: My_Form_validation.php

&lt;?php defined('BASEPATH') OR exit('No direct script access allowed');

class MY_Form_validation extends CI_Form_validation {

    /**
     * Constructor
     *

    function __construct($rules = array())
    {   
        parent::__construct($rules);
    }

    public function is_valid($value)
    {
        $this-&gt;form_validation-&gt;set_message('is_valid', 'The %s field can not contain any spaces');
        return FALSE;
    }
}

$this-&gt;EE-&gt;form_validation-&gt;set_rules('short_name', 'Short name', 'required|max_length[30]|is_valid');


I set the rule in the mcp.module_name.php file, I also swapped out $this->EE->form_validation... with $this->CI->form_validation and nothing.

it is not erroring out, it just doesn't seem like it is loading it correctly.

I tried loading the my form validation library in the mcp.module_name.php constructor and it returns this error: Fatal error: Class 'CI_Form_validation' not found

I shouldn't have to load it since it should load along with the default form validation library.

Below is my constructor for the mcp.module_name.php file

public function __construct()
{
    $this-&gt;EE =&amp; get_instance();
    $this-&gt;CI =&amp; get_instance();
    $this-&gt;EE-&gt;config-&gt;load('config');

    $this-&gt;base = BASE.AMP.'C=addons_modules'.AMP.'M=show_module_cp'.AMP.'module=restaurant_menu';
    $this-&gt;base_url = BASE.AMP.'C=addons_modules'.AMP.'M=show_module_cp'.AMP.'module=restaurant_menu';

    $this-&gt;data['base_url_short'] = $this-&gt;base_short;
    $this-&gt;data['base_url'] = $this-&gt;base;
    $this-&gt;site_id = $this-&gt;EE-&gt;config-&gt;item('site_id');
    $this-&gt;EE-&gt;cp-&gt;set_breadcrumb($this-&gt;base, $this-&gt;EE-&gt;lang-&gt;line('Restaurant Menu'));

    // setup navigation

        //'module_nav_settings' =&gt; $this-&gt;base_url.AMP.'method=settings',
    ));
}


UPDATE:

added this to my construct on mcp.module_name

$this->EE->load->library('form_validation');
$this->EE->load->library('MY_Form_validation');

then in my methods, I run the form validation using: if($this->EE->my_form_validation->run() === FALSE)

Then I set my form field rules:

$this->EE->my_form_validation->set_rules('title', 'title', 'required|max_length[75]');
$this->EE->my_form_validation->set_rules('short_name', 'Short name', 'required|is_valid|max_length[30]');
$this->EE->my_form_validation->set_error_delimiters('', '');

MY_Form_validation.php

&lt;?php defined('BASEPATH') OR exit('No direct script access allowed');

class MY_Form_validation extends EE_Form_validation {

    /**

    function __construct($rules = array())
    {

        $this-&gt;EE-&gt;form_validation-&gt;set_message('is_valid', 'The %s field can not contain any spaces');
        return false;

3380,3380,5390,What is the best way for a user to select an item by unique identifier?,"My team and I are building a mobile app where the user will need to input a human-readable unique identifier (the serial number) of a single unit of inventory. Our system tracks the serial numbers that the user can access. We have considered three possible input modes:

1. We show the user the entire list of serial numbers they can access and allow him to select one from the list (like how a select element would work on an HTML page).

Pros:


The user doesn't have to type anything in.
The user can't enter an invalid serial number.


Cons:


The list is likely to be overwhelmingly large.
The serial numbers usually have the same format and are often sequential, so it might be hard to read the list.
Data usage for downloading the entire list of serial numbers


2. We allow the user to start entering the serial number in a text input and have an auto-suggest drop-down with a filtered list of serial numbers the user can access.

Pros:


The user doesn't have to type in a complete serial number.
The user is unlikely to enter an invalid serial number.
Smaller list to choose from than Option 1.


Cons:


The serial numbers usually have the same format and are often sequential, so it might be hard to read the list.
Auto-suggest may have limited value since the unit has a barcode that we could read.
Data usage for downloading a sizable list of serial numbers


3. We require the entire serial number to be entered, and once we recognize the correct number of characters, we validate the serial number against the user's accessible list and show feedback.

Pros:


The unit has a barcode that we could read, so this has the potential to be simpler than an auto-suggest or select-from-list paradigm.
Simpler implementation
Significantly reduced data usage vs. Option 1 and Option 2


Cons:


The unit has multiple barcodes, so it might take a couple of tries for the user to capture the correct one.
Typing manually would be tedious if the camera is unavailable or barcode scanner isn't working for whatever reason (lighting, etc.)


Which of these three is the best approach? Is there a better approach than what we have considered?

",Furious,https://cooking.stackexchange.com/users/22612,"Assuming plain (American) white rice on a stovetop:

(Generally, American rice does not need rinsing for these applications)

From your description, it sounds like you are going for Steamed Rice; for that, here's what you want to do:

Bring your water, salt and butter to a boil, then add your rice. Stir it until it comes back to a boil. As soon as it boils again, turn your heat way down. Keep stirring until the heat is low enough that you feel safe that you can cover the pot without it hard boiling again. Cover and keep on low to medium-low heat or a moderate simmer (preferably without peeking) for 20 minutes (15 minimum). It is the steam that plumps the rice, so don't lift the lid! It may take some tweaking depending upon your specific equipment, but try to be patient. You may find that you like a little less water and a bit more time. When you do peek (hopefully after at least 15-20 minutes have passed) look for the water to be gone and for little holes or ""divots"" to be formed on the surface of the rice. If you still have water, cover again and keep cooking without lifting the lid for at least 5 more minutes. When it looks done, turn off the heat but still don't stir, you're better off just letting it sit for another 5 minutes - re-covered and with the heat turned off, then stir/fluff it.

If you find that your rice isn't done after 20-25 minutes with the lid on, bring up the heat a bit, but be careful. If your heat is too high, your rice can burn on the bottom. Within reason, if it's just a bit too low, it'll just take longer.

The lid is really key here. Do you have a tight lid for the pan that you are using? If not, we can help you improvise.

A slightly different method using the same ingredients is the Pilaf Method shown here in a great video from the love of my life, Alton Brown. 20 Minute Pilaf See the rice just before he fluffs it with chopsticks? Those are the holes/divots I referred to above in the explanation of the steaming method. In case the link goes bad, here's a description of the video: Bring 3 cups of water to a rolling boil. Meanwhile, in a saucepan with a tight lid, melt and lightly brown 2 Tbs of butter over high heat. Add 2 cups of rice (regular long grain, basmati or jasmine recommended) and saute for a couple of minutes, add 1 tsp salt (Alton uses kosher). When the rice smells ""nutty"" add the boiling water all at once (careful, it will boil rather violently). Cover and turn heat to low. No peeking, cook on low for 15 minutes. Fluff with chopsticks or a fork. Cover again for 5 minutes, no heat.

Note that Alton's pilaf also requires a tight fitting lid. If your lid isn't tight, try using aluminum foil to get a tighter seal.

Finally: With very small variations, these two methods of cooking rice will work fine for just about any type of rice. Some rice, particularly some rice harvested outside of the US should be thoroughly rinsed first. Check your label if you can or revisit this question if you're not sure if your rice should be rinsed. If you use rinsed rice you may find that you want to use slightly less water for cooking than instructed here.

You're using a 2 to 1 ratio for steaming rice, that's fairly typical but you might like a bit less water, just don't go lower than 1.5 to 1. 

Brown rice works fine for these methods too but will take longer and require slightly more water.

The steaming method, particularly if you wait to ""fluff"" will produce a stickier rice, better for chopsticks :) and better to accompany food that has a sauce you want the rice to soak up. I prefer steamed rice to go with stir-fries, for example.

The pilaf method, particularly with medium to long grained rice will produce more individual grains. Nice with steak or baked chicken, something that isn't sauced.

3379,3379,5388,"Good travel games for two players, especially for playing on trains?","I would be interested to hear if anyone had recommendations for 2-player games that are particularly suitable for playing while travelling on trains.  (I ask this as someone who mostly enjoys games like Carcassonne, Power Grid, Agricola, Pandemic, etc. around the table at home.)  To be specific, the things that I think are important properties for these games are:


Needing minimal table space.  Most trains have a small table you could use, but not much more.
Being quiet to play, so that other passengers won't be disturbed.  For example, I imagine that games that involve repeatedly rolling dice wouldn't be appreciated.
Packing down small, so that they don't take up much luggage space.
Not requiring batteries or a power socket.  (I appreciate that an iPhone or a Nintendo DS for each player might be a good solution more generally, but it's not what I'm after in this case.)
Not being so delicate to arrange that motion from the train will unduly disrupt the play.


I think it would be best to recommend one game (or class of games) per answer, if that's appropriate, and explain why you think it's particularly suitable.  (Incidentally, I've read the guidance on good questions about game recommendations and hope this question meets the criteria.)

Update: Thanks for so many excellent suggestions - we certainly won't be short of games for our next long train journey :)

Update 2: Unfortunately, I can't really playtest this many great games in any reasonable time period, so I'm going to accept the top-voted answer (Cribbage) and try out the others as soon as I can.  Thanks again...

5010,5010,7980,"Solve for time, given distance and acceleration","Two gangsters are flying down I-70 West at a constant 108 hm/hr. If they make it to Indiana, they will be safe. When they are 1 km away from the Indiana border, while still traveling at a constant 108 km/hr, they pass a concealed police car hidden in a speed trap. At the instant that the criminals pass the patrol car, the cop pulls onto the highway and accelerates at a constant rate of 2 m/s^2. Does the cop catch up with them before they cross the state line?

Here's what I have progressed so far


  ΔV = (ΔX)/(T)
  
  when V is velocity, X is distance, and T is time.
  
  108 = (1 - 0)/T
  
  108T = 1
  
  T = 1/108
  
  T = 0.00925 hours
  
  T = 0.00925 * 60 * 60
  
  T = 33.33 seconds (this is the time it takes the gangsters to get to
  the borders of Indiana)


What I am stuck at is the time it takes the cop to travel the same distance. I have used the distance formula to find time as follows:


  Xf = Xi + 1/2 * A * T^2
  
  where A is acceleration
  
  Since the cop is starting from rest, the initial velocity is 0 (zero),
  so
  
  1 = 0 + 1/2 * (2) * T^2
  
  1 = T^2
  
  T = 1 seconds


So it takes the cop 1 seconds to travel the whole mile to Indiana? What am I doing wrong?

Unfortunately, since all the above examples contain the specified pattern, all values are matched. This is not my intention.

2963,2963,4713,How can I tell if a downloaded ISO is complete?,"I just ran into a nasty problem with an ISO download from Microsoft.  I successfully burnt it to a rewritable DVD, and copied the contents to the local hard drive on another machine, but when I went to run them they were corrupt.  It turns out the download had been truncated.

Now, OK, sometimes that happens - but it surprised me that the truncated file (which was only slightly more than 60% of the actual ISO) burnt successfully and seemed to be presenting me with a sensible file system, to the extent that I could (apparently) successfully copy the files.

So, is there some way I could have tested the file to see if it was complete or not?  The MS web site did not provide any information about the expected size, so I'm looking for a generic solution: given an ISO file which may or may not be truncated, is there some way to tell?  Do commonly used CD/DVD (data) formats include any embedded information about how much data is supposed to be on the disk, or even better, some kind of CRC?

A solution that detects most truncated images will be accepted, it doesn't need to be perfect.  (I'd prefer something that doesn't give false positives, though.)

[Addendum: a comparison of the disk burnt with the truncated image with the files extracted from the full image suggests that chunks of the data from many of the files were replaced with random information, perhaps from the contents of a previous burn to the same rewritable disk.]

5057,5057,8042,What is the best way for a user to select an item by unique identifier?,"My team and I are building a mobile app where the user will need to input a human-readable unique identifier (the serial number) of a single unit of inventory. Our system tracks the serial numbers that the user can access. We have considered three possible input modes:

1. We show the user the entire list of serial numbers they can access and allow him to select one from the list (like how a select element would work on an HTML page).

Pros:


The user doesn't have to type anything in.
The user can't enter an invalid serial number.


Cons:


The list is likely to be overwhelmingly large.
The serial numbers usually have the same format and are often sequential, so it might be hard to read the list.
Data usage for downloading the entire list of serial numbers


2. We allow the user to start entering the serial number in a text input and have an auto-suggest drop-down with a filtered list of serial numbers the user can access.

Pros:


The user doesn't have to type in a complete serial number.
The user is unlikely to enter an invalid serial number.
Smaller list to choose from than Option 1.


Cons:


The serial numbers usually have the same format and are often sequential, so it might be hard to read the list.
Auto-suggest may have limited value since the unit has a barcode that we could read.
Data usage for downloading a sizable list of serial numbers


3. We require the entire serial number to be entered, and once we recognize the correct number of characters, we validate the serial number against the user's accessible list and show feedback.

Pros:


The unit has a barcode that we could read, so this has the potential to be simpler than an auto-suggest or select-from-list paradigm.
Simpler implementation
Significantly reduced data usage vs. Option 1 and Option 2


Cons:


The unit has multiple barcodes, so it might take a couple of tries for the user to capture the correct one.
Typing manually would be tedious if the camera is unavailable or barcode scanner isn't working for whatever reason (lighting, etc.)

5340,5340,8482,Linearity of push forward $F_*$,"How can I prove the linearity of $F_*$? What does $F_*$ eat?


  If $N$ is smooth manifolds and $F: M \to N$ is a smooth map, for each $p \in M$ we define a map $F_*: T_pM \to T_{F(p)}N$, called the push-forward associated with $F$, by
  $$(F_*X)(f) = X(f \circ F).$$

",Tumbleweed,https://math.stackexchange.com/users/77895,"It often times just helps to write out exactly what the formula you are trying to get in the end looks like, and then interpreting that.

For example, you are trying to show that $F_\ast(\alpha X)=\alpha F_\ast(X)$. So, what does the left-hand side do to elements of $T_{F(p)}N$? Well, as you pointed out

$F_\ast(\alpha X)(f)=(\alpha X)(f\circ F)$

what does the right-hand side look like?

$(\alpha F_\ast(X))(f)=\alpha F_\ast(X)(f)=\alpha X(f\circ F)$

Make sense?

EDIT(to answer Jellybean's questions in the comment): I am not entirely sure what you mean here. The tangent space of $M$ at $p$ is thought of, or at least the book you're reading thinks of it, as the $\mathbb{R}$-derivations of germs of smooth functions $\mathcal{G}_{M,p}$ at $p$. A smooth map $F:M\to N$ allows one to take a derivation $X$ of $\mathcal{G}_{M,p}$ and ""push it forward"" to a derivation of $\mathcal{G}_{N,F(p)}$. The way it does this is basically the observation that if you start with an element of $\mathcal{G}_{N,F(p)}$, germs of smooth functions on $N$ at $F(p)$, there is a way to pull this back to an element of $\mathcal{G}_{M,p}$. Namely, if $f\in\mathcal{G}_{N,F(p)}$ then $f\circ F\in\mathcal{G}_{M,p}$. Thus, if you start with a derivation $X$ of $\mathcal{G}_{M,p}$ you want to use this to produce a derivation of $\mathcal{G}_{N,F(p)}$. 

But, a derivation of $\mathcal{G}_{N,F(p)}$ eats in, well, obviously, elements of $\mathcal{G}_{N,F(p)}$. Thus, $X$ itself doesn't act on $\mathcal{G}_{N,F(p)}$. But, we observed above that we have a method of taking an element of $\mathcal{G}_{N,F(p)}$ and pulling it back to an element of $\mathcal{G}_{M,p}$, which is the set of things that $X$ does eat. So, to create a derivation of $\mathcal{G}_{N,F(p)}$, which let's call $F_\ast(X)$, of $\mathcal{G}_{N,F(p)}$ we merely take an element of $\mathcal{G}_{N,F(p)}$, pull it back to $\mathcal{G}_{M,p}$ by the rule $f\mapsto f\circ F$, and now that we're back on $X$'s diningroom table we feed it to $X$ to get a real number out. Thus, the derivation $F_\ast(X)$ all put together acts as $f\mapsto f\circ F\mapsto X(f\circ F)$. You can check that this definition of $F_\ast(X)$ does, in fact, produce a a derivation of $\mathcal{G}_{N,F(p)}$.

For example, you are trying to show that $F_\ast(\alpha X)=\alpha F_\ast(X)$. So, what does the left-hand side do to elements of $T_{F(p)}N$? Well, as you pointed out

$F_\ast(\alpha X)(f)=(\alpha X)(f\circ F)$

what does the right-hand side look like?

$(\alpha F_\ast(X))(f)=\alpha F_\ast(X)(f)=\alpha X(f\circ F)$

Make sense?

EDIT(to answer Jellybean's questions in the comment): I am not entirely sure what you mean here. The tangent space of $M$ at $p$ is thought of, or at least the book you're reading thinks of it, as the $\mathbb{R}$-derivations of germs of smooth functions $\mathcal{G}_{M,p}$ at $p$. A smooth map $F:M\to N$ allows one to take a derivation $X$ of $\mathcal{G}_{M,p}$ and ""push it forward"" to a derivation of $\mathcal{G}_{N,F(p)}$. The way it does this is basically the observation that if you start with an element of $\mathcal{G}_{N,F(p)}$, germs of smooth functions on $N$ at $F(p)$, there is a way to pull this back to an element of $\mathcal{G}_{M,p}$. Namely, if $f\in\mathcal{G}_{N,F(p)}$ then $f\circ F\in\mathcal{G}_{M,p}$. Thus, if you start with a derivation $X$ of $\mathcal{G}_{M,p}$ you want to use this to produce a derivation of $\mathcal{G}_{N,F(p)}$. 

But, a derivation of $\mathcal{G}_{N,F(p)}$ eats in, well, obviously, elements of $\mathcal{G}_{N,F(p)}$. Thus, $X$ itself doesn't act on $\mathcal{G}_{N,F(p)}$. But, we observed above that we have a method of taking an element of $\mathcal{G}_{N,F(p)}$ and pulling it back to an element of $\mathcal{G}_{M,p}$, which is the set of things that $X$ does eat. So, to create a derivation of $\mathcal{G}_{N,F(p)}$, which let's call $F_\ast(X)$, of $\mathcal{G}_{N,F(p)}$ we merely take an element of $\mathcal{G}_{N,F(p)}$, pull it back to $\mathcal{G}_{M,p}$ by the rule $f\mapsto f\circ F$, and now that we're back on $X$'s diningroom table we feed it to $X$ to get a real number out. Thus, the derivation $F_\ast(X)$ all put together acts as $f\mapsto f\circ F\mapsto X(f\circ F)$. You can check that this definition of $F_\ast(X)$ does, in fact, produce a a derivation of $\mathcal{G}_{N,F(p)}$. 

Thus, the association $X\mapsto F_\ast(X)$ produces a map $F_\ast:T_p M\to T_{F(p)}N$. This map, the map $F_\ast$, is the pushforward. It is a linear map between tangent spaces.

For example: When you are drowning. I can tell you that swimming is pretty much easier when you are naked than when you are wearing heavy armor. However, the rules don't seem to care what armor do you use. Just simple DC 10/15/20 check.

So, in what situations does weight really matter? Or is it just fancy gimmicks?
",Realdeo,https://rpg.stackexchange.com/users/12117,"Basically, weight is used to calculate one thing. Whether or not your adventurer is overburdened with all the stuff he is carrying. 

How much you can carry is determined by the following formulas: 


  Normal Load: Multiply the creature’s Strength score by 10. The result is the weight, in pounds, that the creature can carry around without penalty.
  
  Heavy Load: Double the normal load number (that is, Strength × 20) to find a creature’s heavy load, the maximum weight it can lift off the ground. While a creature is carrying more than its normal load, it is slowed. Carrying such a load requires both hands.
  
  Maximum Drag Load: Five times a creature’s normal load (that is, Strength × 50) is the most weight it can push or drag along the ground. The creature is slowed if it pushes or drags more weight than its normal load, and it can’t push or drag more than its heavy load over difficult terrain.


So basically, if you have too much stuff (but not more than your heavy load), your adventurer is slowed. This is a big problem. For most adventurers this isn't much of an issue, fairly early on in your career you should be able to pick up a Bag of Holding, and not have to worry about load except for the gear your wearing or actively using. 

It's been pointed out in the comments that there are a couple of game mechanics that do use the weight of an item. Prestidigitation can lift up to a pound, Mage Hand can lift up to 20 (Psions and Wild Talent Masters have similar powers). So it comes into play occasionally on this stuff as well.

1964,1964,3128,Why did Voldemort assume that no-one knew about Room of Hidden Things?,"Voldemort hid one of his Horcruxes inside Hogwarts. It seemed to be relying on security through obscurity as far as protecting it. But as we know, it ended up not being so secure because it wasn't so obscure - Harry Potter knew about the Room of Hidden Things.

My question is, the way Rowling describes this hints at the fact that Riddle had an assumption that very few people would ever stumble upon that room. *WHY???



First, let's show Harry's theory on what Voldemort was thinking, how and why:

Here's Harry understanding Voldemort's thinking in HP7 once he figured out where the Diadem was (bold emphasis mine):


  Tom Riddle, who confided in no one and operated alone, might have been arrogant
  enough to assume that he, and only he, had penetrated the deepest mysteries of
  Hogwarts Castle. Of course, Dumbledore and Flitwick, those model pupils, had never
  set foot in that particular place, but he, Harry, had strayed off the beaten track in his
  time at school – here at least was a secret area he and Voldemort knew, that
  Dumbledore had never discovered –


...and later on, with Harry explains the location to Ron/Hermione:


  “He hid it exactly where I had my old Potions book, where everyone’s been hiding stuff for centuries. He thought he was the only one to find it. Come on.”
  
  “And he never realized anyone could get in?” said Ron, his voice echoing in the silence.
  “He thought he was the only one,” said Harry.


.



Yet, from available evidence, that seems to be a completely wrong assumption, even at Voldemort's time. 

Let's examine that last quote again, with emphasis on other info available:


  “He hid it exactly where I had my old Potions book, where everyone’s been hiding stuff for centuries.” ...
  
  ...
  
  “And he never realized anyone could get in?” said Ron, his voice echoing in the silence.
  “He thought he was the only one,” said Harry. “Too bad for him I’ve had to hide stuff in
  my time... this way,” he added. “I think it’s down here... “ 
  
  They sped off up adjacent aisles; Harry could hear the others’ footsteps echoing through the towering piles of junk, of bottles, hats, crates, chairs, books, weapons, broomsticks, bats...


.

OK, so if there's a truckload (or train-load, by the description) of stuff in that room, isn't the only reasonable conclusion: ""the room is a fairly popular destination with plenty of people who've found their way there in the past, and therefore, likely, plenty who will in the future""? 

Doesn't matter what your arrogance level is, the evidence seems to point to only one conclusion - it's quite fine as a place to temporarily bury your dirt so teachers won't tag you for your misdeeds, but this is NOT the place to hide something that you want permanently safe! 

So why did Voldemort make such a moronic mistake?
",DVK-on-Ahch-To,https://scifi.stackexchange.com/users/976,"I think Voldemort's arrogance has to be included in the equation. Voldemort truly believed that he was the only person to discover the Room of Hidden Things/RoR/CaGR, whether that seems logical or not. After escaping Gringotts and jumping off the dragon into the lake, Harry finds himself inside Voldemort's head, able to read Voldemort's thoughts about the Horcruxes:


  [Voldemort] As for the school: he alone knew where in Hogwarts he had stowed the Horcrux, because he alone had plumbed the deepest secrets of that place ...
  And Hogwarts ... but he knew that his Horcrux there was safe, it would be impossible for Potter to enter Hogsmeade without detection, let alone the school. Nevertheless, it would be prudent to alert Snape to the fact that the boy might try to re-enter the castle ...
  Deathly Hallows - Page 444 - British Hardcover
  Harry says, ""He thinks the Hogwarts one is safest, because Snape’s there, because it’ll be so hard not to be seen getting in, I think he’ll check that one last, but he could
  still be there within hours –'


I also think Voldemort was emotionally compelled to hide at least one Horcrux in Hogwarts. Hogwarts -- not unlike for Harry -- was the only place Tom Riddle/Voldemort ever considered a home. Given his propensity for attachment to things (Hogwarts, Founders' items, the snake Nagini) rather than people, it makes sense that 1) he would want to hide a Horcrux in the place that he considered home and 2) due to his emotional attachment to Hogwarts, he could have very well thought that the castle itself claimed him as its ultimate master. If so, then of course no one else would have discovered the Room of Hidden Things, because Hogwarts belonged to Voldemort (in his mind) and Voldemort alone. This represents a twisted sense of entitlement, the inability to see others as equals (seeing people as unskilled in achieving the high level of magical power that he himself had), and unable to imagine that any wizard other than himself could possibly discover or work out the secrets contained within the castle. So, to answer the question, the reason Voldemort made such a moronic mistake in leaving the diadem Horcrux essentially in plain view is because his thinking is distorted and skewed -- for he recognises no other as an intellectual equal or someone to learn from (he already believes he knows it all -- and is full of logic and thinking errors.) Once again, Voldemort underestimates that which he does not value, and there is so much that he does not value that his perception of the world is myopic, imbalanced, and not reflective of reality.

I don't want to trench from one end of the house to the other to put them on the garage wall, so I plan to just have it installed outside in the bushes where the water line comes in from the street. 

I will have 3 cylinder cartridges that are about 7"" diameter and 24"" tall.

I have to say that doesn't seem like a good idea to me. If I were doing this I would just cut a pipe in the basement and put the filter there. In particular I would cut just the pipe going to the kitchen, and not the whole house.

But if you really want too...

For the enclosure use double layer (4 inches) extruded foam sheets including on the ground! Then cover them in some exterior-grade plywood on the outside to protect from damage.

i.e. build a plywood box without beams/poles inside it (put them on the outside), then glue the foam sheets to the inside. Lay some plastic on the ground with small holes for the pipe, tape the plastic to the pipe, then foam sheets on top of that, and put the whole plywood box on top of it.

You'll probably need a 3rd hole for some sort of support to hold the filters.

I would suggest you wrap the pipe first in electrical heating tape (they sell it to protect pipes from freezing, it's what you want) then in waterproof (i.e. closed cell) foam rated for underground use several inches think and bury it.

  At 1st level, your practice of martial arts gives you mastery of combat styles that use unarmed strikes and monk weapons, which are short swords and any simple melee weapons that don’t have the two-handed or heavy property.


Now for the Tavern Brawler feat it states that:


  You are proficient with improvised weapons and unarmed strikes.


And the rules for improvised weapons are:


  In many cases, an improvised weapon is similar to an actual weapon and can be treated as such. For example, a table leg is akin to a club. At the DM’s option, a character proficient with a weapon can use a similar object as if it were that weapon and use his or her proficiency bonus. An object that bears no resemblance to a weapon deals 1d4 damage. 


If the improvised weapon does not resemble a weapon, is simple, and is not heavy or two-handed, could a monk replace the d4 dice? For example if the monk is level 6 and has a unarmed attack of a d6, with a d6 dice instead?

4255,4255,6783,Tool for automatically generating and laying out an entity relationship diagram?,"I've seen a lot of tools which can reverse engineer an ERD from an existing database, but I haven't been able to find one which is capable of automatically laying out the diagram in a reasonable way. Most of them just plop all the entities down on top of each other and call it a day. Some make an attempt at organizing the entities, but they don't do a very good job of it. 

Is there any tool out there that will reverse engineer the structure of an existing database, and then automatically lay it out in a way which is easy to understand and reveals the organization of the database? If I were to make such a tool, I'd have it minimize the length of lines connecting entities, minimize the number of lines which cross each other, and make groups of related entities stand out from each other. I'd also try to deduce which tables are lookup tables, which ones are mana-to-many intermediate tables, etc and lay out the entities such that these roles are obvious to a person looking at the diagram. 

I don't exactly have the funding to make the above, but I do have some funding to buy a tool like that if it's good. 

Edit: I should mention that I'm trying to diagram a database with 100+ tables, so I'd like to automate as much of it as possible.

After your answer martin I had replace my code with yours now its :

  BEGIN
      SET NOCOUNT ON;

      DECLARE @SQLQ NVARCHAR(1000)

        @SQLQ ,
        N'@Counter INT OUTPUT',
        @Counter = @Counter OUTPUT

      Return   SELECT @Counter

",Doug T.,https://diy.stackexchange.com/users/321,"The full list of reasons (partially based on some other good answers here) seems to be:


design improvements (a ""good thing"" on the road to the world having the best screws)


When people come up with improved designs, those start to get used.


network effects (a ""bad thing"")


Some people will stick with older, inferior designs that have many users, since those will be easier to find and they will already have the screwdrivers and bits for them.  Also...


economy of scale (a ""bad thing"")


...gives an advantage to more established designs (even if they are terrible), as production of those will be large-scale and efficient, so new designs (better or worse) will tend to be more expensive.


patenting (and other business reasons that have nothing to do with design) (a ""bad thing"")


As Chris Cudmore points out in a comment to a different answer here, this is the reason Phillips screws are more widespread than Robertson (square) screws, despite Robertson ones being generally better (far more difficult to strip the heads.  ...and what was Ford's first choice again?  ...exactly.).


desire to have some things be tamper-proof (mostly a ""bad thing"")


Guarding against vandalism (special washroom stall screws) and preventing theft (special car wheel lug nuts) are decent goals, but the motives are not always as good.  (Is Apple just trying to protect users against themselves with pentalobe screws, or are there other, worse reasons for them, such as pushing more people back Apple for any repairs?)  The tamper-proof requirement is pretty clearly at odds with what most users would want, though, as each variation means another set of screwdrivers or bits someone would need to own to be prepared.   Of course the fact that the designers of these screw heads often make money off each screwdriver or bit sold points to that being one reason the screw is out there in the first place.


different applications (mostly a ""good thing"")


To end on a positive note after all of that, the different applications of screws really do leave room for multiple ""best"" designs.  The points about wet applications and applications with small countersink-type heads (which can only fit much smaller bit sizes of the grippier designs) are great.



(Still...  We would be much better off if we just started using Robertson screws 99% of the time!)

Actually, triangle heads should be best.  They should have the best torque (as long as the sides are vertical), while still being simple to cut (low manufacturing costs).  I just looked up whether they exist, though, and apparently they are being used as yet another tamper-proof design.

The points about wet applications and applications with small countersink-type heads (which can only fit much smaller bit sizes of the grippier designs) are great.



(Still...  We would be much better off if we just started using Robertson screws 99% of the time!)

Actually, triangle heads should be best.  They should have the best torque (as long as the sides are vertical), while still being simple to cut (low manufacturing costs).  I just looked up whether they exist, though, and apparently they are being used as yet another tamper-proof design.

  I'm concerned that the SQL query is not safe, among other things.


Well, you're right to be concerned.  I don't know much about PHP (basically nothing), so I'll let someone who does know about PHP comment about that half of your code.

But from the Swift end, we're passing the password as plaintext.  We really shouldn't be doing this.  When we send passwords over any sort of networking request, the password should be encrypted in some way.  MD5 is a common approach.  I'm not a safety expert and couldn't say one way or the other whether or not MD5 is still appropriate or not, but anything is better than passing completely unencrypted passwords.



func attemptRegister() {
    var variables: [String] = [""firstname="" + self.firstName! + ""&amp;""]
    variables.append(""lastname="" + self.lastName! + ""&amp;"")
    variables.append(""username="" + self.username + ""&amp;"")
    variables.append(""password="" + self.password + ""&amp;"")
    variables.append(""email="" + self.email!)
    request(""https://codekaufman.com/register.php"", variables: variables)
}


This method will crash every time it's call and one of your optional properties is nil.

If these properties truly are optional, then we need to optionally unwrap them:

if let email = self.email {
    variables.append(""email="" + email)
}


And moreover, appending the &amp; to the end of each of these variables here seems really contrived.

Moreover, why do we need to build the array here and pass it into another method... when the array is built of nothing more than instance variables that the other method has access to?

To be honest, if this is me, I think I completely rethink and restructure this class.  You call this class User, but it's nothing more than a utility for signing in or registering with your service.  How usable is this object after the user has either signed in or registered?  And should we REALLY be storing a password for as long as this object is kept around?

Realistically, our username/password (and in the case of registering, the other information) should be passed to a function, even if it's a class function of the user class.  As soon as we send the information to the web service, we should forget about it within the app.  

And then, assuming a successful response from the web service, our User class should be instantiated with the information about this user that our app actually needs to use.  A userid?  Display name, profile picture, etc?  These are the things our User class should keep as instance variables--the information that our application needs AFTER the user has successfully signed in or registered.  And we definitely should not be hanging on to information we need for signing in or registering (except any of this information that is also information that our app needs to function).



This bit of code by the way is a little redundant:

if (userData != nil) {
    println(""NSData had data, printing and returning."")
    println(userData)
    return userData
} else {
    println(""NSData empty, returning nil."")
    return nil
}


The only reason to actually split this into an if/else is because you want to print this stuff out for diagnostic reasons.  But realistically, in the final version of your app, you won't want to print this stuff out... and as such, the if/else could be eliminated.

As such, I'd rewrite this section as:

#if DEBUG
    if (userData != nil) {
        println(""NSData had data, printing and returning."")
        println(userData)
    } else {
        println(""NSData empty, returning nil."")
    }
#endif

return userData


We don't need to return a literal nil when userData is nil.  If userData is nil, then the statement return userData will already return nil for us!

1626,1626,2549,Mosfet to save power,"I am making a battery powered project which involves bi-directional motor control. However motor needs to turn rarely (about 10-20 seconds in 24 hour period). I am using L298 motor driver. However the quiescent current is in mA range. To reduce current consumption, I am planning to use a mosfet switch as shown in the figure below:

VM = 9 V

VCC = 4.5 V or 6 V (I will decide after a little experiment)

Motor current consumption &lt; 1 A



Whenever I need to use the motor, I will turn the mosfet ON and keep it OFF while the motor is not in use. (I am using logic level mosfet.) The quiescent current of mosfet is in uA range and that's how I am planning to save a lot of battery power.

Will it work?

Any suggestions/improvements are welcome.

It needs a base resistor for the BJT or use a logic-level MOSFET. R1 could be something like 10K and the base resistor 20K or so. The p-channel MOSFET should be logic level for your conditions. You can find dual p/n channel units in an SO8 that can handle some amperes. 

The problem with switching the ground connection (low side switch) is that there are two power supplies on the chip and the inputs will end up biased at some voltage above ground, which may draw unnecessary current and/or be bad for your micro.

55,55,82,"What are the disadvantages of ""puncture proof"" (or puncture resistant) tires?","Some people refer to tires that are more resistant to punctures as ""puncture proof"" tires.
For example: Specialized All Condition Armadillo Tyre

Even though these tires are not really puncture proof, they do reduce a lot the chances of puncturing. So the advantage is obvious.

Apparently, they're not too expensive compared to regular tires. So, I was wondering why people would choose not to use these more resistant tires. What are their disadvantages?
",b.roth,https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/users/131,"The obvious advantage is puncture resistance

There are several disadvantages:


weight
rolling resistance
grip
ride
cost


There are several levels of puncture resistance and a Kevlar belt is not the only means.

Let me tell you a story.  After two years on a tire with moderate puncture resistance got my first flat and had to walk it home.  I got on-line and bought THE most puncture resistant tire I could find ignoring all other factors.  It is twice as heavy as the old tire (and feels twice as heavy), noticeably more rolling resistance, less grip, terrible grip in wet, and a harsh ride.  I don't like it.  If I get zero flats in two years compared to one not worth it.

Even racing tires typically come with some puncture resistance. Some time trial tires have none.

Means of puncture resistance


Puncture resistant material such as Kevlar.
There are other materials such as Duraskin by Continental. 
The material may be only on the tread strip or include sidewall. 
Can even have a combination like a Gator Hard Shell.  
Material in tread strip
Not material specifically designed for puncture resistance - more material. 
Rubber or SmartGuard. Make the glass or thorn travel further. 
An example is the Marathon Plus HS 440.
Harder rubber
Bounce glass and thorns off and also slow them down if they do penetrate 


Pick your level of protection


Puncture resistant material in tread only
This adds puncture resistance at a very small performance impact. 
Comes in all but very very cheap tires. 
Most racing tires even have this.
Puncture resistant material(s) in tread and sidewall
Adds even more puncture resistance at still a very small performance impact. 
At this level it is more just a cost thing. 
A cheap tire is not going to have this extra material. 
An expensive tire will have better puncture resistance, performance, and ride compared to a  cheap tire.
More material (e.g. rubber)
Adds more puncture resistance but now you get into noticeable performance impacts.   
Harder rubber
Harsher ride and less traction.


Pick a tire for a combination of performance, ride, puncture resistance, and price.

5931,5931,9399,most basic laser diode driver?,"Is a simple LM317-based laser diode driver safe for powering a laser diode?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuMngik0GR8 (the diagram is at 1:37)


I've been told the the proprietary drivers offer some extra protection from very short spikes (on power up and shutdown) in the current which laser diodes are very sensitive to and might be damaged from. But isn't the LM317 regulator taking care of that itself already?

I've been told this from people who actually sell commercial laser diodes so I'm thinking they might be showing some bias.
",Leo Ervin,https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/75978,"The main issue with the circuit you've shared is transients.

Some linear regulator circuits will tend to overshoot on turn-on, or allow input transients to pass through to the load. Here's the ripple rejection curve for TI's LM317:



You can see that the LM317 will do very little to protect the laser from transients with characteristic times below about 1 us. And an ESD event can easily have a pulse width as short as 1 ns.

And many laser diodes are quite sensitive to over-voltage and over-current. They may also respond very quickly to transients compared to other devices that you might connect to an LM317.

Some linear regulator circuits will tend to overshoot on turn-on, or allow input transients to pass through to the load. Here's the ripple rejection curve for TI's LM317:



You can see that the LM317 will do very little to protect the laser from transients with characteristic times below about 1 us. And an ESD event can easily have a pulse width as short as 1 ns.

And many laser diodes are quite sensitive to over-voltage and over-current. They may also respond very quickly to transients compared to other devices that you might connect to an LM317.

1723,1723,2727,How to implement Many to many relationship for USERS TABLE in ruby on rails without using any extra table?,"I am a newbie to the Ruby on Rails but stuck at this interesting situation :

I have three Models with me :


User
Company
Project


I want to relate them in the following way :


Company has_many Users  
Users belong_to Company

Implemented via company_id column in USERS table

User.Company or Company.Users works fine.





Project has_and_belongs_to_many Users   
Users has_and_belongs_to_many Project

Implemented via has_and_belongs_to_many relation using in projetcs_users table

Project.Users or User.Projects works fine.




The real problem comes when I want them to join as following as well : 


Company belong_to Owners  (:through => User)
Owner has_one Company

---A company can have multiple owners but one user can own just one company. He can't be owner of multiple companies.

---A user may or may not be owner of a company but always belong to some company.
---A user cannot be part of two companies.
Project has_one Project_manager  (:through => User)
Project_manager belongs_to Projects

---A Project can have just one Project_manager but one can be project manager of multiple projects.


I am not able to figure out how the relationship should be defined in the Models. Also what should be the table structure for all three models.

My objective is to achieve :


Company.Owners

It can be done by : 

@owner = User.find(Company.owner_id) 
Project.Project_manager

It can be done by : 

@Project_manager = User.find(Project.project_manager_id)

3639,3639,5807,Why would a sump pump cycle when pumping large amounts of water?,"In my septic system, I have a sump pump that pumps the liquid into the drainage field. We have a tank alarm in this tank with the pump, but someone (not sure if it was me or someone else) forgot to turn back on the alarm one time. So now that 1000 gallon tank is over flowing. The pump circuit has been blowing for me at the fuse box. It seems to blow the circuit based on getting a bunch of rain. I'll do a separate question for that.

My question is this. I can hear the pump run for a bit (I haven't kept track of the time) then stop. After a while it will start again. Is there a safety or something that would cause the pump to not run until there is no water left? This happens no matter if the float is hooked up or I am just plugged in straight. Or could it be the drainage field is full of water and needs to seep out so there is room for more?

I know the tank isn't empty cause shortly after the pump stops, water starts seeping out of the lid again. (and the alarm light is still on).

4068,4068,6491,"Maximal ideal in $\mathbb{Q}[x,y]$","I am trying to prove that $(x,y)$ is a maximal ideal of $\mathbb{Q}[x,y]$. Since an ideal $I \subseteq R$ is maximal if and only if $R/I$ is a field, it suffices to prove that $\mathbb{Q}[x,y]/(x,y)$ is a field.
Let $\phi : \mathbb{Q}[x,y] \rightarrow \mathbb{Q}$ be the evaluation homomorphism that sends $p(x,y)$ to $p(0,0)$. $\phi$ is clearly surjective and if I prove that the kernel of $\phi$ is the ideal $(x,y)$, the result will follow by the First Isomorphism Theorem.    

$(x,y) \subseteq Ker(\phi)$ is obvious, but to prove the reverse inclusion, my idea is to take a polynomial $p(x,y) \in Ker(\phi)$ and to perform Euclidean division of $p(x,y)$ with $y$ and $x$ in $(\mathbb{Q}[x])[y]$ and $(\mathbb{Q}[y])[x]$ respectively. The problem is that neither of them is a polynomial ring over field. There is a theorem saying that if R is commutative and if $R[x]$ is a PID, then $R$ is a field. Since neither $\mathbb{Q}[x]$, nor $\mathbb{Q}[y]$ are fields, it follows that neither $(\mathbb{Q}[x])[y]$, nor $(\mathbb{Q}[y])[x]$ are PIDs, hence are not Euclidean domains.   

Obviously, Euclidean division does not solve the problem. If we consider $p(x,y)$ as an element in $(\mathbb{Q}[x])[y]$ and if we divide by $y$, then we get a quotient $q(x,y)$ and a remainder which is $0$ or of degree $0$ over $(\mathbb{Q}[x])[y]$, hence a polynomial $r(x)$ in $x$ only.    

Then, $p(x,y) = yq(x,y) + r(x)$ and the hypothesis $p(0,0)=0$ does not guarantee that $r(x)=0$. So, we cannot conclude that $y$ divides $p(x,y)$.

Is there a way to remedy this proof, or is there another approach to this problem?

  ICS Android enable gps programmatically? [closed using an alternative approach]  




I was using the code below to enable and disable GPS programmatically and worked perfectly in 2.2 and 2.3.

Intent i = new Intent();
i.setClassName(""com.android.settings"", ""com.android.settings.widget.SettingsAppWidgetProvider""); 
i.addCategory(Intent.CATEGORY_ALTERNATIVE);

However, when trying to use the ICS (4.0) realized it did not work. Then I discovered that it was a bug as link below.

I believe we have fixed in ICS.

Could anyone tell me if there is an alternative to solve this in ICS?

5767,5767,9138,Another instructor is pushing me out of the classroom right after my class ends,"I am a graduate student in math in my final year, and for several years have been teaching at my department as a lecturer. This semester, in the same lecture hall there is another lecture that starts 20 minutes after my class ends. It's taught by another instructor from my department. I usually have many students coming to office hours and there are also students asking questions immediately after lecture. Due to other activities, I cannot have office hours right after the lecture this semester and can only stay for about 15 minutes to answer questions.

Many times in the past I had a similar situation and never had any issues with it. This semester the instructor who is teaching right after often arrives 20-15 minutes before her class starts and tells me immediately that I have to go with my students somewhere else. 

I make sure to leave the blackboard clean and take all my stuff away from the instructor's desk before she arrives, but I do believe that I have a right to stay in the classroom after my lecture for at least 5-10 minutes. There is no vacant classroom around, and I don't have time to go with students to my office, which is in a different building.

Last time the instructor told me in front of my students that I don't understand ""simple things"" and that I am ""playing games"". When I was talking to one of my students, she stood very close to us and clearly demonstrated that she wanted us out. I tried to explain her that I couldn't go anywhere else due to my time constraints, but she didn't want to listen to me. I really don't understand what ""simple"" things she meant and what ""games"" I am playing. 

We leave the board clean. She doesn't need to set up a projector. She can still talk to her students before her class starts, if she wants to (even though it seems like her students don't ask her any questions before their class). So, I don't see how I cause any disruption. 

I had met this woman many times before this semester, but we never talked. I didn't see her talking to other instructors/students much, and she seems to be quite reserved and a bit neurotic. She doesn't want to have any conversation with me regarding the issue.

I felt really offended after last class when she said those things to me in front of my students. What would you do in my case? 

Added later: There are no official rules regarding classroom occupancy between classes. Instructors are supposed to use common sense and be reasonable. For me using 50% of the break time seems reasonable to answer questions after lecture seems reasonable. I agree that for some people it may not.

I don't block the entrance to the classroom. A few students from the next class who come earlier always go ahead and take their seats as soon as my students start leaving the room. I also had one of the students from the next class listening to my explanation to one of those after-class questions and asking me further questions before their class (which is the same class as I am teaching, just a different section). Maybe the instructor got jealous, I don't know.

The entrance to the classroom is from its front (not back), so I do stay in the front. But it is a big lecture hall, and there is a plenty of space in front of the room (the board itself consists of 8 huge panels).

Also, during my career as a grad.student who is also teaching for the department, I have had several observations from experienced professors who are considered to be great teachers at the department and are in charge of undergraduate teaching policy. In my evaluations the fact that there are always several students approaching me with questions after class considered as very positive, meaning that students find me approachable. 

Thank you everyone for answers.

If A and B commute then $[A,B] = ABA^{-1}B^{-1} = e$ where e is the identity element of the group.

$$\therefore AB=BA$$

$$n=1; [A,B^1] = (1)B^0[A,B] = e$$
This statement is certainly true. however moving on to $n = 2$ I find...

$$[A,B^2] = AB^2A^{-1}B^{-2} = ABBA^{-1}B^{-1}B^{-1} = BBAA^{-1}B^{-1}B^{-1}$$

Where in the last step I have used the fact that A and B commute to rearange the terms. However, it is plain to see that this last term simply reduces to the identity as well and for the n = 2 case we have:

$$[A,B^2] = e \ne 2B[A,B] = 2Be = 2B$$

Clearly I have assumed something I shouldn't have. The fact that there is a multiplicative factor of n implies I should be adding things, but I thought if I kept it as general as possible, the answer should just fall out naturally. I don't want an answer please, only guidance.

3473,3473,5538,What are the relativistic effects of expanding spacetime?,"This is a question I've been mulling over for a while and I'm hoping someone here can point me in the right direction. Sorry if it's a bit of a novice question. For the record, I don't fully know GR, but don't let that stop you from using it in the answer.

Since the universe is expanding - that is, the spacetime metric is expanding by way of a near-exponentially increasing scale factor - we can say that the distance between any two non-bound objects is increasing over time. Herein lays my dilemma; if there were two objects separated by a large distance that had no relative velocities initially, after a long time, the effects of expansion would cause them to have large apparent velocities away from each other. Given that there hasn't been any acceleration to cause these velocities, are there still relativistic effects in play? That is, is there time dilation between the two frames?

Furthermore, given long enough time, the rate of increasing distance between the two objects could place them outside of their visible horizon (ie they are travelling away from each other at superluminal velocities). Since there was still no acceleration to achieve this feat, what can one say about the relativistic effects in this case?

At first I thought this was an easy question. I thought of course there would be relativistic effects and when the objects go superluminal, the visible horizon is there to ensure there can never be causal contact and thus preserve physics. But then I thought what if spacetime stopped expanding abruptly (seems crazy but as far as I know, nothing makes this completely impossible)? Since there was no initial relative velocities, wouldn't the two objects return to being in the same inertial frame? And seeing as none of them experienced any sort of acceleration, how then could we describe their two final states? By which I mean, if we were to assume there were relativistic effects during transit, how would we overcome such simple paradoxes like the twin paradox, or other relevant ones?

At this point, I'm stumped. I even attended a lecture by Miguel Alcubierre since he would have had to consider these types of effects in his design... No help. Equations are great to illustrate a point, but I'm really going to need a conceptual answer as well to fully understand this.

  Given that there hasn't been any acceleration to cause these velocities, [...]


As a side issue, even in Newtonian mechanics, accelerations don't cause velocities. Accelerations are just a measure of how rapidly velocities are changing.

What you're running into here is the fact that general relativity doesn't have any notion of how to measure the motion of object A relative to a distant object B. It is neither true nor false that A and B gain relative velocity due to cosmological expansion. It is neither true nor false that A and B have nonzero accelerations relative to one another. Frames of reference in GR are local, not global. It's valid to say that distant galaxies are moving away from us at some velocity. It's also valid to say that everything is standing still, but the space between us and the distant galaxy is expanding.


  [...] are there still relativistic effects in play? That is, is there time dilation between the two frames?


Kinematic time dilation is well defined in SR, which means that in GR it's only defined locally. Gravitational time dilation is only well defined in GR in the case of a static spacetime, but cosmological spacetimes aren't static. So it is neither true nor false that there is time dilation between us and a distant galaxy. Concretely, you could measure Doppler shifts. If you feel like interpreting these shifts in purely kinematic terms, you can assign a velocity to the distant galaxy relative to us. But this is not mandatory and actually doesn't really work very well, in the sense that the velocity you get is usually several times smaller than the rate at which the proper distance between the galaxies is increasing. (Proper distance is defined as the distance you would measure with a chain of rulers, each at rest relative to the CMB, at a moment in time defined according to a notion of simultaneity defined by cosmological conditions such as the temperature of the CMB.) In particular, there are galaxies that we can observe that are now and always have been receding from us at $v&gt;c$, if you define $v$ as the rate of change of proper distance. The fact that we can observe them tells us that their Doppler shifts are finite and correspond to $v&lt;c$.

Here is a nice popular-level article that explains a lot of this kind of stuff:

Leaving aside the cybernetics and unlimited time travel possibilities, Kirk also discovered substances that amplify psi abilities (Plato's Stepchildren), accelerate time (Wink of an Eye), and turn crones into beautiful women (Mudd's Women).  There was a truth machine (Mudd's Women, Court Martial).  There was the Kelvin technology, including their superfast warp drive and human-to-styrofoam-to-human encoding (By Any Other Name).  There was the IQ boosting ""Teacher"" technology of the Eymorgs (Spock's Brain).

If we are to accept that these events are part of the Star Trek canon, then the conspicuous absence of all these technologies in the 24th century Federation must be by design.  My favorite pet theory is that there is some sort of technology police like Larry Niven's ARM that quietly squirrels away the dangerous knowledge to keep it from destabilizing society.  There is some support for this theory to be found in the Star Trek: Voyager episode ""The Omega Directive"", where Kirk-era information about warp-destroying omega particles was shown to be suppressed by Starfleet.

It is a two parameter plot. So I like to see either of $ u,v $ parameter lines being pointed at with the value of the set constant only.

To make clear with an example, when I mouse over circles, like to see Tooltips in the above ParametricPlot pointing with SINGLE values {$ 1,1.25,1.5,1.75,2 $} and also when mousing over radial lines  SINGLE {$ 0, \pi/12, 2 \pi/12,...5 \pi/12, \pi/2 $ }  for the radial lines.

It is a very simple requirement that I believe could cater to a common requirement of a majority of users. I am not looking at high frequency sophisticated dynamic motion picture display. Not even looking at double parameter display at intersection/junction  of parameter lines. Just like the way height is displayed for ContourPlots. Here it is required for both parameters, with or without Shading. 

Asked this because it is not (yet) a standard feature.

Based on Michael E2's lines, tried to depict eccentric circles.In the space  between parameter lines it may need to be somewhat changed.

1862,1862,2959,Why is a precoder necessary for DQPSK and what does it accomplish?,"I've implemented a soft-decoder for DQPSK using the wonderful answers I received here:

How to soft decode DQPSK?

To get the soft-decoder working properly I needed to precode the data I was sending out.  I implemented the precoder mentioned in this paper:

$I_k=\overline{u_k \oplus v_k}*(u_k \oplus I_{k-1})+(u_k \oplus v_k)*(v_k \oplus Q_{k-1})$
$Q_k=\overline{u_k \oplus v_k}*(v_k \oplus Q_{k-1})+(u_k \oplus v_k)*(u_k \oplus I_{k-1})$

I'd like to know why this precoder is necessary -- what does that complicated expression of XORs actually accomplish?  

Here's a table showing what the equation yields.  If ""to_encode"" is 00, the to_send symbol is the same as the previous (""prev"") symbol.  If the ""to_encode"" is 11, the to_send symbol is the previous symbol xor 11.  What is the meaning in other cases?


to_encode prev  to send

3257,3257,5193,How does Christianity deal with biblical criticism related to the Old Testament?,"As an orthodox Jew I have seen quite a stir lately regarding the topic of biblical criticism, specifically towards the Old Testament (Torah). 

I have perused several questions in this stack which seem to address this topic in general, and learned a lot about apologetics, but I have not seen answers that address some of the major claims of biblical criticism, especially as it pertains to the Old Testament. 

For example:


The story of Noah and the flood seems to be contradicted by archaeological evidence as well as having been 'borrowed' from earlier flood narratives such as the Gilgamesh story
Many of the portions of the Old Testament seem to be borrowed from earlier near eastern texts such as the Hammurabi code 
The notion that there are multiple authors (documentary hypothesis) of the Old Testament.


In short, how does Christianity deal with some of the major contentions of biblical criticism towards the Old Testament?



I apologize if any parts of my question offend any sensibilities to which I am unaware. 
",user5796,https://christianity.stackexchange.com/users/5796,"Christians are very diverse on how they handle this type of criticism.

The most liberal Christians treat the Bible as one of many worthwhile ancient writings and as a product of the sharing of knowledge across cultures. The Genesis account was inspired by Gilgamesh. Mosaic Law and Hammurabi's Code may have been derived from the same source.

1048,1048,1648,Regular Expression to Match String Exactly?,"I'll preface this question by mentioning that while I'm far from a regular expressions guru, they are not completely foreign to me. Building a regular expression to search for a pattern inside a particular string generally isn't a problem for me, but I have a (maybe?) unique situation.

I have a set of values, say:


  028938
  DEF567987
  390987.456
  GHI345928.039  


I want to match a certain set of strings, such as:


Strings composed of exactly 6 digits
Strings composed of exactly 6 digits, a decimal, followed by exactly 3 more digits


In the above examples, the first and third values should be matched.

I'm using the regular expressions:

[0-9]{6}
[0-9]{6}.[0-9]{3}


Unfortunately, since all the above examples contain the specified pattern, all values are matched. This is not my intention.

So my question, in a nutshell, is how to write a regular expression that matches a string exactly and completely, with no additional characters to the right or left of the matched pattern? Is there a term for this type of matching? (Google was no help.) TIA

I have no programming experience except knowing how to do ""Hello world"" in Java.","Someone almost hit the nail on the head above. Programming is mathematics.  More specifically, programming is a branch of mathematical logic called computability theory or recursion theory.

Other branches of math are involved directly, specifically formal language and automata theory. These help describe regular expressions, used in pattern matching, and formal grammars, used to describe and parse programming languages.

Anybody who says that programming is not mathematics either doesn't know what they're talking about, or has an ulterior motive, like a ""Intellectual Property"" maximalist, who hopes to profit by getting a patent on an algorithm or some other basic mathematical fact or discovery.

1665,1665,2634,How do I deal with a clinic billing mistake that was sent to collections?,"Recently I created a CreditKarma.com account so that I can keep and eye on my credit.  Upon logging in, I noticed I have a pretty low score (not that surprising since I just opened my first credit card recently), but I had a look around anyway just out of curiosity.

What I found out was that I have three medical bills in collections from my local clinic that total around $250!

What's odd is that I have insurance that should have paid those costs, and I've never received bills from them before for that reason.

What can be done to get this removed from my credit report without paying it, since I wasn't supposed to pay it in the first place.  Likely this started out as just an insurance mistake between the clinic and my insurance.

When I paid them, I got checks 8 weeks later for the exact amounts I'd written, stating that it was over-payment.

1) Contact the clinic

Ask if you actually owe anything. They'll be able to pull all of the billing records for your account. If you do owe something, let them know that your insurance was supposed to cover that. If they insist that insurance doesn't / didn't, then you're liable for whatever is left. If it has gone to collections, you'll have to pay through the collections company, not directly to the clinic.

2) Contact the collections company

They are notoriously bad at keeping their records up-to-date, and will continue to report ""unpaid medical"" until you pay it or they clear it. If the clinic says you're paid up, let them know that. They will contact the clinic to get the billing records. Once that's cleared up, move on to...

3) Contact the credit bureaus where this is affecting your history

You can dispute an item to have it removed. They will contact the collections company and raise the dispute. If you've contacted collections, and they know you don't owe anything, they'll clear it when the dispute reaches them. 

This process can take a few months to complete (and for the bad mark to be removed from your report). In general, a single $250 medical bill past due doesn't have a huge effect on your credit score, but it's always good to get it cleared up.

682,682,1077,"Shortening the coax on UHF CB antenna caused SWR to get worse, why?","I shortened the coax cable on my car's 477MHz CB antenna because the braid was frayed at the transciever connector end, and a metre or so of spare coax was coiled up behind the dash. I thought if I cut the coax shorter, I would remove a little cable loss.

I measured SWR with a meter before and after: Before was 1.3:1, after 1.7:1. This seems quite a bit worse. I don't know how much this will affect performance.

I think I assembled the new connector pretty well, good solder joints to centre and braid.

Could my antenna setup be sensitive to the length of the coax? I have not heard of tuned lengths but my understanding of antenna and feeds is limited.

My vehicle's antenna is mounted at the front, it has a short solid base tube with a standard threaded mount onto which I fitted a 60cm 4.5dBi whip (the original antenna was missing). I don't know exactly what the antenna mount is but it looks similar to this one.

I'd like to understand what has happened, if I have significantly affected the performance of my antenna system, and how I might be able to fix it if so (splice the cut part of the coax back on?)

1998,1998,3191,Change of basis in non-linear Schrodinger equation,"At the mean-field level, the dynamics of a polariton condensate can be described by a type of nonlinear Schrodinger equation (Gross-Pitaevskii-type), for a classical (complex-number) wavefunction $\psi_{LP}$. Its form in momentum space reads:

\begin{multline}
i \frac{d}{dt}\psi_{LP}(k) =\left[\epsilon(k) 
-i\frac{\gamma(k)}{2}\right] \psi_{LP}(k) 
+F_{p}(k)\,\, e^{-i\omega_{p}t}  \\
+  \sum_{q_1,q_2} g_{k,q_1,q_2}\, \psi^{\star}_{LP}(q_1+q_2-k)
\, \psi_{LP}(q_1)\, \psi_{LP}(q_2).
\end{multline}

The function $\epsilon(k)$ is the dispersion of the particles (polaritons). The polaritons are a non-equilibrium system, due to their finite lifetime (damping rate $\gamma$). Therefore, they need continuous pumping with amplitude $F_p$ at energy $\omega_p$.
Finally, there exists a momentum-dependent nonlinear interaction $g_{k,q_1,q_2}$ that depends of the so-called Hopfield coefficients $X$ (simple functions of momentum) as:

\begin{equation}
g_{k,q_1,q_2}=g\, X^{\star}(k)\, X^{\star}(q_1+q_2-k)\, X(q_1)\, X(q_2)
\end{equation}

How can one transform the equation for $\psi$ to real-space?
",Andrei,https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/24609,"Here is my attempt at an answer, following the suggestion of @Lagerbaer. We first subtitute the Fourier Transform for $\psi_{LP}(k)$,

and get

\begin{multline}
\int dxe^{-ikx}i\frac{d}{dt}\psi_{LP}(x)=\int dx\left[\epsilon(k)-i\frac{\gamma(k)}{2}\right]e^{-ikx}\psi_{LP}(x)\\+F_{p}(k)\,\, e^{-i\omega_{p}t}

\end{multline}

In order to simplify this expression, we need to apply the inverse transform to both sides (multiply by $\int dke^{ikx}$), obtaining

\begin{multline}
i\frac{d}{dt}\psi_{LP}(x)=\int dx^{\prime}\psi_{LP}(x^{\prime})\int dk\left[\epsilon(k)-i\frac{\gamma(k)}{2}\right]e^{ik(x-x^{\prime})}+F_{p}e^{i(k_{p}x-\omega_{p}t)}\\

\end{multline}

Now we look at an integral of the form $\int dx^{\prime}\psi_{LP}(x^{\prime})\int dkf(k)e^{ik(x-x^{\prime})}$, for a generic function $f(k)$. We expand our generic function in a Taylor Series around $k=0$, and get:

\begin{equation}
\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{f^{(n)}(0)}{n!}\int dx^{\prime}\psi_{LP}(x^{\prime})\int dkk^{n}e^{ik(x-x^{\prime})}=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{f^{(n)}(0)}{n!}\left(-i\right)^{n}\int dx^{\prime}\psi_{LP}(x^{\prime})\partial_{x}^{n}\delta(x-x^{\prime})
\end{equation}

where we have used the well-known relation $\int dkk{}^{n}e^{ik(x-x^{\prime})}=\left(-i\right)^{n}\partial_{x}^{n}\delta(x-x^{\prime})$.

Moving the derivative operator to act on $\psi$ (integration by parts), we finally obtain

\begin{equation}
\int dx^{\prime}\psi_{LP}(x^{\prime})\int dkf(k)e^{ik(x-x^{\prime})}=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{f^{(n)}(0)}{n!}(i\partial_{x})^{n}\psi_{LP}(x)=f(i\partial_{x})\psi_{LP}(x)
\end{equation}

Therefore, the first term on the RHS of our equation simplifies to $\left[\epsilon(i\partial_{x})-i\frac{\gamma(i\partial_{x})}{2}\right]\psi_{LP}(x)$ and we are left dealing with the interaction term.

\begin{equation}
\int dx_{3}\psi_{LP}^{\star}(x_{3})\int dx_{1}\psi_{LP}(x_{1})\int dq_{1}e^{iq_{1}(x_{3}-x_{1})}\int dx_{2}\psi_{LP}(x_{2})\int dq_{2}e^{iq_{2}(x_{3}-x_{2})}\int dkg(k,q_{1},q_{2})e^{ik(x-x_{3})}

1224,1224,1919,1024-bit DHE vs 2048-bit RSA,"Currently with apache/mod_ssl, if DHE is enabled then a 1024-bit ephemeral key will be used. I found the following quote in Adam Langley's blog:


  Ideally the DH group would match or exceed the RSA key size but 1024-bit DHE is arguably better than straight 2048-bit RSA so you can get away with that if you want to.


So it appears that he is advocating something like DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA with 1024-bit ephemeral DH keys over AES256-SHA with a 2048-bit RSA key. My understanding is that 1024-bit DH (ephemeral or not) is of comparable security to 1024-bit RSA. Why would he make such a recommendation? Does he value the forward secrecy offered by DHE that much?
",safsaf32,https://security.stackexchange.com/users/31140,"There are two sides to the question:


Perfect Forward Secrecy: by using a ""DHE"" cipher suite, you actually encrypt the data with regards to a DH private key which never gets stored on any disk. For any given SSL session, the encryption may be cracked if the attacker succeeds at cryptanalysing the public key used for encryption (DH for a DHE cipher suite, RSA for a RSA cipher suite), or if the attacker steals a copy of the private key. The latter occurrence is actually much more probable in practice for a RSA-based cipher suite; and the point of PFS is to remove that threat.
RSA vs Diffie-Hellman: for the time being, the best known methods for breaking RSA and DH entail solving two hard problems, integer factorization and discrete logarithm respectively. It so happens that for both problem, the fastest known algorithm is the General Number Field Sieve (though initially a factorization algorithm, a variant of GNFS can be applied to discrete logarithm). For asymptotic complexity, RSA and DH are thus of equivalent hardness when the DH modulus has the same size as the RSA modulus.

However, in practical term, DH is a tad harder. GNFS includes several phases, the two main being the sieve and then the linear reduction. For a big modulus, the linear reduction becomes the bottleneck because of the sheer size of the matrix. For a given modulus size, you will get the same number of elements in the two matrices (the one for RSA and the one for DH), but the matrix elements are simple bits in the RSA case, vs integers modulo p in the DH case. Thus, the DH matrix is larger.

It won't make n-bit DH as ""hard"" as 2n-bit RSA, though. If we look at the records, we see 768-bit for RSA, 530-bit for DH; and the DH case used less raw power. Moreover, it is not completely justified to compare the hardness of 1024-bit DH with the hardness of 2048-bit RSA, since both are in the ""cannot break it"" zone.


A summary of all this goes thus: while 1024-bit DH is somewhat stronger (theoretically) than 1024-bit RSA, the difference is slight (say, 1024-bit DH is like 1200-bit RSA at most). But in practical terms the risk of private key theft, for a non-ephemeral key, dwarfs out any cryptanalytic risk for any RSA or DH of 1024 bits or more; in that sense, PFS is a must-have and DHE with a 1024-bit DH key is much safer than RSA-based cipher suites, regardless of the RSA key size.

When they are 1 km away from the Indiana border, while still traveling at a constant 108 km/hr, they pass a concealed police car hidden in a speed trap. At the instant that the criminals pass the patrol car, the cop pulls onto the highway and accelerates at a constant rate of 2 m/s^2. Does the cop catch up with them before they cross the state line?

  the borders of Indiana)


What I am stuck at is the time it takes the cop to travel the same distance. I have used the distance formula to find time as follows:


  Xf = Xi + 1/2 * A * T^2

  Since the cop is starting from rest, the initial velocity is 0 (zero),
  so

I'm trying to perform reverse-DNS lookups to understand where traffic is coming from - e.g. what percentage of IPs resolve to corporations, schools, government, international etc.

Despite a bunch of optimizations, individually reverse-DNS'ing every IP address still appears to be fairly expensive though. So -

is there any way to obtain an entire range of IPs from a reverse-DNS?

If yes, this could greatly reduce the number of actual reverse-DNS lookups.

Example (numbers slightly obfuscated): 


Log file contains a request from an IP 128.151.162.17
Reverse DNS resolves to 11.142.152.128.in-addr.arpa 21599 IN PTR alamo.ceas.rochester.edu
(So this is a visitor from Rochester University, rochester.edu)
Now, would it be safe to assume that all at least all IPs from 128.151.162.* will also resolve to rochester.edu?
What about 128.151.*.*? Is there a way to get the exact IP range?

5034,5034,8011,Is hacking back a valid security technique for companies?,"Recently it has come to light through the reverse engineering of hacking tools that there are vulnerabilities in them that could be exploited to take over an attackers computer during a remote hacking session. In other words, while they are hacking you, you could get into the system from which they are launching the attack to find out what they have managed to access, what the system is, or even p4wn it yourself. The goals would be damage control, deterrence, and ultimately being able to charge the perpetrator of the crime. 

Leaving aside the many legal, ethical, and moral considerations (if you are curious there's a debate recorded here), my question is whether hacking back using this technique has any value to a company. If it was ethical and legal would it be worth a company to invest in the systems and skills needed to make this work, or is it a waste of money? 

EDIT:
There's been several comments regarding leaving the legal and ethical considerations out of the question, so here's the explanation behind that. So far the discussion of hacking back in this manner has been discussed by lawyers, some shouting it is legal, and others saying it isn't. What they do agree on is that there's no case law, and until there is there will be no clear answer. Also, legalities vary from nation to nation, so the answer to legality is ""maybe"" and ""it depends where you are"". 

However so far none of the discussion I've seen has been among IT Security professionals who would be the ones to design, deploy, and run systems that would to the hacking back. The lawyers all seem to think that organizations would adopt the technique as a matter of course, but I am not in agreement with that and I would like to hear the views of my peers. This is why I've asked the question apart from legal and ethical aspects.

I have been reading more and more on this topic, and while I see that rechargeable batteries should be recycled, I'm finding conflicting evidence on how best to dispose of Alkaline batteries.

For example, Duracell claims that since they removed the mercury from batteries, they're safe for disposal.  But others claim (see Disqus comments at the bottom) that since all batteries contain various kinds of heavy heavy metals and should thus be recycled.

You need to re-compile your website in Release mode.


  What about binaries compiled with debug symbols?
  
  One scenario that several people find very useful is to
  compile/pre-compile an application or associated class libraries with
  debug symbols so that more detailed stack trace and line error
  messages can be retrieved from it when errors occur. 
  
  The good news is that you can do this without having the have the

  Specifically, you can use either a web deployment project or a web

6033,6033,9576,Can a Floating Action Button morph be reverted?,"There are two specific examples in the Android Floating Action Button guidelines that explain how the button can morph into either new buttons, or a toolbar. 


  If the hallmark of the app is adding file types, a floating action
  button can morph into related actions after it is first touched.





  If a floating action button morphs into a toolbar, that toolbar should
  contain related actions. In this example, the button lets the user
  select the media type to add.




After the button has morphed, how does the user revert back to the previous single button mode?

As I understand it, the rest of the UI is not blocked after these buttons have morphed, so it's not clear how the user can hide the new buttons or revert the morphed shape if they decide not to go through with the new action.

Update

This is more commentary than anything else: I just took a look at Drive to find implementation examples and found an Bottom sheet instead of a FAB morph.

3828,3828,6092,Conductivity of Aqueous Ionic Solutions as a Function of Time,"It is well-known that an aqueous ionic solution can conduct electricity. Let's take the electrolyte NaCl for example. In the diagram below, the circuit consists of a voltage source, a light bulb, and a concentrated NaCl solution. 

Initially, the bulb will shine brightly. Assume the voltage source can source energy forever. My question is: will the NaCl solution allow current to flow forever, or will the conductivity of the NaCl solution degrade over time?


",boxofchalk1,https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/57046,"This is really physical chemistry, but since the question is here:

When you electrolyse solutions you need to consider secondary reactions that might take place at the electrodes. For example if you produced sodium at the cathode it would immediately react with water to produce Na$^+$ and hydrogen. Therefore the cathode produces H$_2$ not sodium metal.

Likewise, if the salt solution is dilute the anode produces oxygen. So the net result is that you are splitting the water into hydrogen and oxygen, and as the water is removed over time the concentration of the sodium chloride will get higher and the conductivity of the solution will increase.

However as the concentration of NaCl increases, the reaction at the anode changes and starts producing chlorine instead of oxygen. This produces sodium hydroxide in the cell, which means the concentration of NaCl decreases and the concentration of sodium hydroxide increases. The molar conductivity of NaOH is greater than the molar conductivity of NaCl, so as before the overall conductivity carries on increasing with time.

The solution in the cell will eventually become saturated in sodium hydroxide, but the solubility of NaOH in water is extremely high: from memory it's about 50% by weight. At some point the mobility of the ions is going to start decreasing and the conductivity will fall. However I'm not sure at what point that will happen and whether it happens before or after saturation is reached. Eventually of course the cell will dry out completely and solid NaOH is an insulator.

All my routes are working fine and I am getting JSON response when requesting any route when I am logged out and I only get problem with files inside public directory.

I am running my script on server with forever start -c nodemon bin/www

1471,1471,2315,"What benefits do ""title search companies"" have over physically visiting a land records offices?","I am looking into buying my first piece of real property.

Basically my question is ""why do title search companies even exist?"". Who uses them? And why?

Are they doing something special apart from going to the local authoritative body and performing a title search on a parcel id number?

A) Am I paying them just so they can do my due dilligence and then stamp some big ole company seal on the documents they provided me with? So I feel more confident in the documentation provided?

B) Do they exist solely to service large banks and corporations who control thousands of property deeds worldwide and cannot afford to pay a staffer in every single city on earth just to perform title searches?

C) Or might they exist for some other reason that I am entirely unaware of?

I am not trying to be facetious. I am genuinely curious. As somebody who has never looked into the process of acquiring land in the past, they seem to be redundant as a service. I can't imagine how so many of them are still in business.



Take Detroit, MI for example.

There is a website called https://www.waynecountylandrecords.com (which is run by the city of Detroit) where I can go and pay them $6 for 15 minutes of access to perform as many property title searches as I can manage in 15 minutes. It costs $2 per page to print (download) documents from that database, up to a maximum of $10 per document.

That, or I could physically visit the land records office listed on their website and do the same thing in person. Although it would cost me a bit more money I believe.



So again my question is why would I spend more money with a title search company as opposed to performing the title search myself?

Is it simply because ""performing a title search"" requires the ability to circumnavigate a bunch of legal mumbo jumbo or even know where to perform the title search in the first place? I am quite distraught over the (what seem to me to be) unnessary complications involved in purchasing a property.

I'll be frank. I create and maintain extremely large computer databases for a living. So the idea of paying somebody $25+ to basically extract data from a database and then pass it on to me seems asinine.

The sole fact that a city like Detroit Michigan is placing a pay wall of $6 to even perform an online title search seems ludicrous to me as well. Seeing as it's in their best interest to give potential investors full and complete knowledge of any liens on the literally thousands of properties they are in need of having purchased by tax-paying individuals. For what? A few $100k in annual revenue for the City? But, I digress.

I do understand that it's literally a thousand+ year old system, so I carry on in search of knowledge.

If I absolutely have to go through a title search company to receive the full benefits of a title search, please explain why below.

Thank you for reading.

4237,4237,6756,"What are the disadvantages of ""puncture proof"" (or puncture resistant) tires?","Some people refer to tires that are more resistant to punctures as ""puncture proof"" tires.
For example: Specialized All Condition Armadillo Tyre

Even though these tires are not really puncture proof, they do reduce a lot the chances of puncturing. So the advantage is obvious.

Apparently, they're not too expensive compared to regular tires. So, I was wondering why people would choose not to use these more resistant tires. What are their disadvantages?
",b.roth,https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/users/131,"Though there no doubt are ""puncture-resistant"" tires that seek to accomplish that end by means of extra-thick rubber, for the past 15-20 years the standard for puncture resistance has been Kevlar belted tires, which look and ride like ordinary tires and weight essentially the same as ordinary tires (maybe a few grams more). 

The Kevlar belt under the tread increases puncture resistance by at least a factor 10, eliminating most common glass/thorn punctures, and also reducing the tendency of the tire to ""bruise"".

Price wise, my recollection is that they are about 30% more expensive than standard tires, but they likely last that much longer (plus save a lot on tubes), so the cost is pretty much a wash.  (The odd thing is that Kevlar-belted tires are so hard to find.)

Some people apparently confuse ""Kevlar belted"" tires with ""Kevlar bead"" tires.  The latter are ""folding"" tires and are supposedly desired because they are a hair lighter than metal bead tires, plus they can be folded and stuffed in a pannier.  But you can buy Kevlar belted with a metal bead (my preference, since folding tires are a PITA to install), and Kevlar bead tires are not necessarily Kevlar belted (in fact, most often not).

Update:  Last Saturday I had my first puncture in maybe 5 years (maybe 2000 miles), while finishing up a 35-mile morning.  Just got around to fixing it because it's been ungodly hot and humid. (Hitched a ride home the last two miles, since there was no way to fix the flat in 95-degree weather on a 4-foot shoulder in the sun with traffic whizzing by at 70 MPH.)

The culprit was apparently a construction staple that had pierced the tire just outside the belt, gone through the sidewall of the tube, and then punched a bigger hole in the inside diameter of the tube.

I do notice the tire is wearing a bit thin, so I'll probably have to replace it within a year or so.  I'm dreading trying to find a 700/35c road tire with Kevlar belt, though -- the catalogs are now full of off-road tires and cater even less to the touring market than they did 5-10 years ago.

This is a more or less minimal working example. Style file can be found here, and the bib file here.

EDIT 2

A workaround that worked for me (for now). The four questionmarks in question (hehe) were the result of missing year in the bib file. I have modified the custom_style.bst from

FUNCTION {format.date}
{ year ""year"" bibinfo.check duplicate$ empty$
    {
      ""empty year in "" cite$ * ""; set to ????"" * warning$
       pop$ ""????""
    }
    'skip$

to

I used the author instead of the title field because BibTeX otherwise would typeset the label V00 in the text.
The second pair of curly braces prevents BibTeX from breaking the ""author"" down in first name and last name.

2582,2582,4108,"GIN/GiST Full Text searches through openlayers, geoserver and postgres","I have a a web app that automatically maps recent tweets and allows you to search for certain keywords. it uses Postgres for the database, geoserver as the server, and openlayers as the cartographic library. Right now tweet keywords are done using the ILIKE query.

This works pretty well if the keyword i'm looking for is a commonly used word, like 'love' , 'friend', 'OMG', etc. but less common words like ""geospatial"" need to search through a lot more data in order to find the last n instances of the word. This is dead slow.

To combat my slowness I'm building a GIN index on my tweet field in postgres. Two days later and i'm still waiting for the index to complete. Once it's built though, I'll try a few queries using SQL view parameters and hopefully this will dramatically speed things up.

Even if this approach works though, it's not going to be all that useful if the index takes so long to create -- the maintenance of it will not be able to keep up will the incoming flood of data. I think I will try out the GiST index next and see how long it takes as I understand it is much faster to this build index. 

Beyond this, what can I do next? Do options like Solr work with Geoserver?? Are there any common approaches to this type of problem and data size/rate?

it is not too expensive for me (less than 200$) (otherwise I would have fancied a Teenage engineering OP1;

it is extremely portable (for the above commuting);
it can be played even without being plugged to a pc (otherwise I would have chosen this korg nano keyboard);
it can study some music theory with it;
in some six months I will be able to show some decent performance with it (so to say, I hope it has a bit of depth and is not just a toy).


Since (as I said), I know nothing of music and musical instruments, I would like to have someone savvy to 'validate' my points; alternative suggestions/idead would be appreciated, too!

6020,6020,9554,Do volcano blast changes earth's course?,"Volcano blasts are one of the most powerful calamities on earth. When they blast they release large amount of mass in the air just like a jet does. Does such a blast have any effect on the course of the Earth? Does it change the Earth's orbit in any way? If not then how big a blast is needed to do it? Would a full eruption of the Yellowstone Supervolcano do it?
",Dimensionless,https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/9023,"I do not think volcanic eruptions can change the course of the earth.

This is because whatever materials a volcano ejects ultimately land back to the ground, so the earth remains on its path. So no change in course/radius.

If, however, you can manage to create a blast which sends particles with such a force and such a speed that they never come back again (the speed will have to be $\geq 11.2 km/s$), then we can think about the change of course of the earth. Can Yellowstone do it?

But even if that DOES happen, the mass which it will be able to eject completely out of earth's gravitational field will be very less compared to the mass of the earth. So we can neglect and tiny change, since it's almost nothing. However, if a volcano could blast off even $1/10^{th}$s of the earth's mass, then we'd have some change in course/radius.



Addendum: I just thought of one thing though-
The material thrown up in a volcanic eruption emerges from inside the earth. When the eruption is over and the material is back on the ground, there has been a slight net displacement of the materials. What was first a few kilometres under the surface is now lying on the surface. Therefore, there may as well be a tiny change in course. 

HOWEVER, as pointed out before, the mass thrown up by a volcano is very very very less compared to the mass of the earth and the displacement of the material is very very less compared to the radius of the earth ($\approx 6400 km$), we can safely neglect this tiny change in course.
Even if there is a change, the radius of the earth's orbit around the sun is 150,000,000 km. A change in course by a fraction of a centimetre will make NO difference at all.



Addendum-2: Akash points out that the materials striking the ground don't apply the same force as the force at which the volcano erupts.   

That is not true. It may seem that the force is less, but that is because the materials are fragmented and a lot of the force is applied onto air too.
The force is distributed between all the particles and the air. When each particle strikes, it imparts its force to the earth. The air 'falls' back too, applying a force too. If you add up the forces, it will be equal to the force of the volcano.
Unless, of course, the materials are propelled out of the earth's gravitational field.

When they explode, they release a lot of substance in the air just like a jet plane. Does such an explosion have any effect on the operation of the earth? Will it change the earth's orbit in any way? If not, how big an explosion would it take? Can the full eruption of Huangshi super volcano be achieved?","I do not think volcanic eruptions can change the course of the earth.

This is because whatever materials a volcano ejects ultimately land back to the ground, so the earth remains on its path. So no change in course/radius.

If, however, you can manage to create a blast which sends particles with such a force and such a speed that they never come back again (the speed will have to be $\geq 11.2 km/s$), then we can think about the change of course of the earth. Can Yellowstone do it?

But even if that DOES happen, the mass which it will be able to eject completely out of earth's gravitational field will be very less compared to the mass of the earth. So we can neglect and tiny change, since it's almost nothing. However, if a volcano could blast off even $1/10^{th}$s of the earth's mass, then we'd have some change in course/radius.



Addendum: I just thought of one thing though-
The material thrown up in a volcanic eruption emerges from inside the earth. When the eruption is over and the material is back on the ground, there has been a slight net displacement of the materials. What was first a few kilometres under the surface is now lying on the surface. Therefore, there may as well be a tiny change in course.

I was wondering about the state of this sql dump if the users are still using the system. Could it cause any inconsistencies ?

Also, I would like to know if pg_dump is the best choice for taking backups in this case. Of course as the database grows the backup takes a lot of time which slows the overall process.

  I was wondering about the state of this sql dump if the users are still using the system


pg_dump relies on PostgreSQL's MVCC support to ask PostgreSQL to take a snapshot of the database state at a given point in time.

Changes made by concurrent transactions after the point where pg_dump gets its snapshot do not affect pg_dump, whether they're committed or not.

There are a few things that aren't necessarily consistent, like sequences, which continue to increase while pg_dump is running. But applications have to be prepared for gaps in sequences anyway, so this isn't considered to be a problem.


  Also, I would like to know if pg_dump is the best choice for taking backups in this case


No, you're way better off using WAL archiving and PITR for your purpose. Look into PgBarman and read the docs on continuous archiving.

You should still take logical dumps for disaster recovery, but it need not be an all-the-time thing.

Any filesystem-based backup takes too long -- just enumerating which files need to be copied takes a day. 
Acronis can do a disk image in 24 hours, but fails when it tries to do a differential backup the next day. 
DFS-R won't replicate a volume with this many files.


I'm starting to look at Double Take, which seems to be able to do continuous replication. Are there other solutions that can do continuous replication at a block or sector level -- not file-by-file over a WAN?

Some details:


The files are split up into about 75,000 directories.
99% of the daily change comes from adding new directories; existing files are rarely changed.

641,641,1013,Tool for automatically generating and laying out an entity relationship diagram?,"I've seen a lot of tools which can reverse engineer an ERD from an existing database, but I haven't been able to find one which is capable of automatically laying out the diagram in a reasonable way. Most of them just plop all the entities down on top of each other and call it a day. Some make an attempt at organizing the entities, but they don't do a very good job of it. 

Is there any tool out there that will reverse engineer the structure of an existing database, and then automatically lay it out in a way which is easy to understand and reveals the organization of the database? If I were to make such a tool, I'd have it minimize the length of lines connecting entities, minimize the number of lines which cross each other, and make groups of related entities stand out from each other. I'd also try to deduce which tables are lookup tables, which ones are mana-to-many intermediate tables, etc and lay out the entities such that these roles are obvious to a person looking at the diagram. 

I don't exactly have the funding to make the above, but I do have some funding to buy a tool like that if it's good. 

Edit: I should mention that I'm trying to diagram a database with 100+ tables, so I'd like to automate as much of it as possible. The database is not one I'm very familiar with, so I'm looking to learn from looking at the diagram rather than dumping what I know into a diagram (which seems to be what most diagramming tools are designed for).

  1 . Is each application pool equivalent to a .Net AppDomain?


No, an application pool may have several AppDomains. Each AppDomain represents a single running ASP.NET Application.  Many ASP.NET Applications may belong to a single Application Pool.


  2 . Or it is a equivalent to a .Net process?


Not quite.  See below.


  3 . How is Application pool related to IIS w3wp.exe?


An application pool represents a limited number of worker processes that may host a potentially larger number of applications.  This is similar to how a SQL Connection Pool shares a limited number of connections among an arbitrary number of requests.

By default, an Application Pool gets one Worker Process (w3wp.exe), and it's usually best to leave this setting alone unless you know what you're doing.  Still, an Application Pool can be configured to use any number of processes.

The Worker Process is actually the resource that's being pooled here, not the AppDomain.  There will always be the same number of AppDomains as there are ASP.NET Applications (unless one is in the middle of shutting down, or an application creates its own AppDomains), but the number of Worker Processes is independent; an Application Pool gives you a specific number of Worker Processes to handle requests for a specific number of AppDomains.

A setting of 1 (the default) for the number of worker processes in an App Pool means that all Applications/AppDomains in the pool share the same worker process.

Others have answered for the commercial and chartered sectors, which is increasingly being strangled due to regulation.  This answer will focus on the private sector.  

Where are these announced? 

The short answer is they are not announced, at least publicly like on a web site. Any kind of advertising or public communication kicks them into the charter or commercial spheres. When you know that a private pilot is planning to fly, you can ask if he wants to take you along.  It's that simple.

I think it's OK to exchange emails with somebody who already knows you and met you personally or through a club, but they are not going to warm up to somebody out of the blue.  Also in terms of 'where are these announced', some discretion can be in order. If you go around identifying your contacts by name on your Facebook page, it may not be appreciated and you're likely to find your emails unanswered after that.

If you know something is on a pilot's bucket list, like flying a Nanchang CJ-6 (a vintage two seater on many dream bucket lists), you can keep your eyes open for that kind of opportunity.  Whatever gets you talking to pilots and in the air is key towards empty leg travel.

Another example...  In 2018, there will be a competition to fly around the world in Bristol Bulldogs.  For people who live on the route and are aware that Bulldogs need to land for maintenance and fuel at the drop of a hat, there's an opportunity to offer some hospitality and a quick tour of your city. 

A really great calling card is the ability to speak different languages and to let people know you're happy to translate.  I have also done pet-sitting, baby-sitting, driving, tour guiding, and cabin clean up/dish-washing.  Having multiple passports also gives you a slight edge because you don't face visa issues. 

How can one travel this way?

Some important things to point out about this...


Timing.  If you haven't done it before, it's not going to happen overnight unless you're very lucky. It takes a long time to get oriented and to establish yourself as an enthusiast. 
Flexibility. You don't always go exactly when you want and where you want. Instead, you go where the pilot is going and that may leave you with additional transportation to reach your destination - or even stranded for a while.  For example, a flight into Heathrow or Gatwick would be extraordinarily rare; the general case is  they are headed for a private airport like Cotswold or even as far out as Humberside.  There are about 20  - 25 airports in the greater London area and home counties, but not every type of plane is cleared for their type of strip(s).  On the plus side and if you are younger, being 'stranded' at some random field gives the opportunity to hang around the terminal and meet pilots who might be flying to some place else (note: I never went 'total gypsy' myself, but have spoken with people who managed to hop respectable distances over the course of say, a year; others have found that the demands of being flexible became unpleasant as they got older). 
Regulations.  It's getting worse and worse.  Airpooler is now moribund because of US regulations.  BlackJet was supposed to have Uber's business model, but now appears to be offering very expensive pay-only arrangements to avoid being shut down.  And the EU has jumped in with stricter interpretation of Regulation 965/2014, which is making some pilots reluctant to do anything at all unless they know you well.

You can attend events and festivals, like the annual one at Shobdon Field where anybody can go and enjoy the event while expressing enthusiasm for the sport.
You can be a volunteer in Project Orbis, or raise donations in a challenge event.  The Corporate Angel Network also takes in volunteers for data entry (with no direct path to flying) but leading to a wealth of knowledge about flight schedules, pilots, fractional owners, private car operators, airports, and all the rest.  
Check out newly converted or upgraded airports like Conington. Check out their engineering and repair facilities, what kinds of certifications they offer. Even Wifi and broadband. It's all useful knowledge.


Finally, having some kit, like a Delorme Communicator or a Zulu class headset can be a tremendous help. Certainly the pilot will have his own, but it helps to establish you as a serious enthusiast who uses his own stuff.

Others have answered for the commercial and chartered sectors, which is increasingly being strangled due to regulation.  This answer will focus on the private sector.  

Where are these announced? 

The short answer is they are not announced, at least publicly like on a web site. Any kind of advertising or public communication kicks them into the charter or commercial spheres. When you know that a private pilot is planning to fly, you can ask if he wants to take you along.  It's that simple.

2825,2825,4498,Need help with a subsets problem,"With the set $X=\{1,2,...,n\}$, How many subsets of $X$ contain $1$? How many subsets of $X$ don't contain $1$?

My work: 
I know a set with $n$ elements has $2^n$ subsets. The way I tackled this problem was to make a finite set like {1,2,3} and tried to make some generalization from it. I made a decision tree diagram to figure out the different subsets. 

If $1$ was contained in the subset, then the different subsets with $1$ would be:
$$\{1,2,3\},\{1,2\},\{1,3\},\{1\} $$ 
which made me think there are four subsets. $2^n = 4$ which means $n=2$ but there are 3 elements in here so I generalized it as:
$$2^{n-1}$$
where $n \ge 1$ such that $n \in N $ is how many subsets of X that contain $1$.

And for the subsets of $X$ that don't contain $1$, the answer should come out the same as the previous question because, again, if I were to make a finite set like $\{1,2,3\}$, then the subsets without $1$ would be:
$$\{2,3\}, \{2\}, \{3\},  \{\emptyset\}  $$

which is also, $$2^{n-1}$$
where $n \ge 1$ such that $n \in N $ is how many subsets of X that don't contain $1$.

I think it makes sense in my head but I am still unsure. Am I understanding this problem correctly or am I completely missing it?

1910,1910,3042,Does scratched Teflon coated frying pans contain carcinogens which can cause cancer?,"Is it true that using scratched Teflon-coated pans contain carcinogens, and if so, can they be consumed through the food cooked in them?

E.g.


The deadly toxins from non-stick frying pans

",kenorb,https://biology.stackexchange.com/users/1195,"The question and link imply that if cooking with Teflon generates carcinogens that carcinogens then always lead to cancer. This is not always true. In some cases exposure to carcinogens may signal protective pathways. Oncogenesis and exposure to both genotoxic and non-genotoxic carcinogens are not always positively correlated. Cooking with Teflon influences how you cook, and it's how you cook that has the greatest effect on the levels of carcinogens in food.

Cooked food contains carcinogens in the form of reactive oxygen species. This is related more to the heat its cooked at than the type of cookware used. Carcinogen exposure in the heating of biological material is an interesting subject.

Carcinogens can be classified in 2 categories (1):


Genotoxic carcinogens (Reactive Oxygen Species/ROS)
Non-genotoxic carcinogens (PFOA is thought to be here)


Genotoxic carcinogens facilitate the formation of cancer through alterations in a cell's DNA. 

Non-genotoxic '...carcinogens have no direct interaction with DNA; they are believed to cause tumors by disrupting cellular structures and by changing the rate of either cell proliferation or of processes that increase the risk of genetic error. (1)'

The molecular mechanism most often thought of for cancer formation is genotoxic oncogenesis, damage to DNA. Here, genotoxic oncogenesis often involves a reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS may generate free radicals which, when reacting with other molecules, generate more free radicals. Another example of a reaction involving free radicals is a fire. Human cells contain genes for antioxidant enzymes, like glutathione and superoxide dismutase, which catalytically converts the free radical superoxide into hydrogen peroxide. 

The abundance of ROS in our cells has 2 components:


Production of ROS
Depletion of ROS by upregulation of antioxidant enzymes


Intracellular levels of ROS positively regulate levels of antioxidant enzymes like glutathione and superoxide dismutase (2). This means that more oxidative stress leades to more protection from ROS by antioxidant enzymes. This is why exercise, while increasing ROS levels, actually protects against them.

ROS are also produced during the cooking of food, especially meat (3). This applies to any type of cookware, any method of heating of any food: protein, carbohydrates, fats. 


'For example, it only takes a few hours at 70C to have the same extent of autoxidation which at room temperature requires months (4)'


Intracellular ROS are unavoidable. They are produced by normal metabolism, exercise, cosmic radiation, during the consumption of food. Balancing this are endogenous antioxidant enzymes. The antioxidant power of glutatione exceeds any known nutritional supplement (5). 

Exercise is an extremely effective upregulator of antioxidant enzymes, eclipsing any antioxidant supplement or change in cookware. Regular physical activity will most likely be the best prevention one can take against ROS induced genotoxic oncogenesis.

After I had installed most of the regular Windows applications I was using in Windows 7, I started on a getting-acquainted tour of the new OS and its ""ModernUI""apps.

The generic file type icons displayed in the Photos app really puzzled me, but a lot of Internet searching finally led to the solution: any installation of a recent version of the open source office suite ""LibreOffice"" changes the Windows registry of common graphics file types in an undesirable way, so that they are treated as a document rather than a picture.

There is a very long thread about the problems and solutions at http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows8_1-pictures/windows-81-photos-app-does-not-show-any-photos/5b1740bc-d87d-4d07-afe5-c1a60cdecd55?page=6&amp;msgId=9cdf0542-aab0-4a0b-85aa-e9f6d40b64fc

The simplest solution presented was a registry file which has to be reapplied every time LibreOffice is upgraded. The file must contain the following text and be named with a .reg suffix, then double click on it to load it into the registry. You may have to log out and back in, or even restart the computer--I can't remember which I did to get it to work.

4900,4900,7798,Paying for mortgage points vs investing that money,"First time home buyer here.

So I've been reading about points and how an up-front payment can save you money in the long term.  At first, the numbers seem pretty convincing.  For example, pay $5000 upfront for a whopping saving of $20,000 over 30 years.  

... But if you took that $5000 and invested it, wouldn't you get a lot more than that over 30 years, even at a modest return rate of 6-7%?  Suddenly points seem worthless.

Is my math wrong?  Is there some other advantage regarding points that I'm missing?
",anon,https://money.stackexchange.com/users/3505,"Let me give you the benefit of my experience. I paid a bunch of points (4) when I bought my first house for similar reasons than you mentioned including:


Lower interest rate would result in savings over life of 30yr loan
I had a big capital gain from cashing out stocks for the house down payment and the points (as interest) would offset the tax liability.


Why I wish I hadn't:
(1) Interest rates plummeted (not as likely to happen today) and I wound up refinancing the loan within the fist 10 years negating the savings that I would have had over the life of the loan. Also, it made me feel stupid for paying close to $5K to knock 1% or so off the loan rate only to have an even lower rate offered to me with no points within a decade.

(2) I didn't take into account that I'm the type of person who would try to pay the loan off early, and I did. Way Early. So even if I hadn't refinanced, the extra points were really a waste of money.

(3) In the US, at least, you can't always deduct ALL of the money you paid in points in the first year. You may have to spread that deduction over several years.

(4) You are right about the alternative being better (investing the points), since the benefit of paying them is at most 1-2% on your loan, you don't even need a 6-7% return to make it a better deal to invest them. HOWEVER, I get skeptical when people compare paying interest to returns on invested money like that. If you don't pay the points will you actually invest that money for the 30 years (or whatever the term of the loan is)? It's easy to say that when you are talking theoreticals, but $5k in your pocket is also pretty tempting when the deal is done.

127,127,202,Is it code-legal to have a circuit breaker box within a storage room?,"I am currently in the process of planning a room remodel to convert an existing bedroom into a home office and storage room.  One thing that makes this conversion a little bit tricky, is the existence of a breaker box at the rear corner of the room.

As you can see in the image below, we plan to have the back 5' of the room become a storage area (there would be 2' deep shelving units along the back wall, stopping short of the breaker box, we would use this area to store Christmas decorations, misc. stuff, etc..).  I know it is illegal to place a breaker box in a closet that will store clothes or other combustibles.  So my questions would be: 1) how would one define a storage room vs. a closet (i.e.- could this be classified as a walk in closet somehow?) and 2) with > 36"" clearance in front, and 30"" around, would this be legal?


",MarkD,https://diy.stackexchange.com/users/346,"National Electrical Code (NEC) typically defines rooms and areas based on the ""intended"" use of the area. They do not provide a definition for a ""storage room"", but they do provide a definition for a ""clothes closet"".


  Clothes Closet. A non-habitable room or space intended primarily for storage of garments and apparel.


To answer the rest of your question, we'll have to take a look at Article 110.  Since section 110.26 of the NEC is a bit long, quoting the entire text here may not be considered ""fair use"" so instead I'll summarize it for you.


  National Electrical Code 2008
  
  ARTICLE 110 Requirements for Electrical Installations
  
  II. 600 Volts, Nominal, or Less
  
  110.26 Spaces About Electrical Equipment. Sufficient access and working space shall be provided and maintained about all electrical
  equipment to permit ready and safe operation and maintenance of such
  equipment.


110.26(A)(1) Depth of Working Space.
This section says the depth of Working Space must be between 3 and 4 feet, ""measured from the exposed live parts or from the enclosure or opening if the live parts are enclosed"".  In a typical residential situation, the depth of Working Space will be 3'.

110.26(A)(2) Width of Working Space.
This section says the width of Working Space must be the width of the equipment or 30"", whichever is greater. And that there should be enough Working Space to allow the equipment door to open 90 degrees.

110.26(A)(3) Height of Working Space.
The Working Space must be clear from ""the grade, floor, or platform"" to the height of 6 1/2', or the height of the equipment whichever is greater. There is an exception to this which says:


  In existing dwelling units, service equipment or panelboards that do not exceed 200 amperes shall be permitted in spaces where the headroom
  is less than 2.0 m (61⁄2 ft).


This section also says that any other equipment associated with the electrical installation""located above or below the equipment, cannot extend more than 6"" beyond the front of the equipment.


  110.26(B) Clear Spaces. Working space required by this section shall not be used for storage. When normally enclosed live parts are
  exposed for inspection or servicing, the working space, if in a
  passageway or general open space, shall be suitably guarded.


Which means the equipment can be in an area used for storage, but the Working Space cannot be used for storage. The basic idea is if you draw a box on the floor in front of the equipment 30"" wide and 36"" deep, and then extend that box up 6 1/2', you'll have your ""Working Space"". As long as you keep this Working Space clear, you should have no problems.  However, there are a few more things to consider.

110.26(C) Entrance to and Egress from Working Space.  


  110.26(C)(1) Minimum Required. At least one entrance of sufficient area shall be provided to give access to and egress from working space
  about electrical equipment.


You'll have to check local building codes to determine what the ""sufficient area"" is, and then make sure you keep this area clear too. 

Another important consideration is lighting.

110.26(D) Illumination.
This is a section that is often overlooked in residential situations, and is often satisfied simply by having lights in the room where the service panel is installed.  Personally, I take this section seriously.  I recommend installing a dedicated circuit, consisting of a single switch and a single luminaire. Then installing it just above the equipment, as to provide adequate light for anybody working on the equipment.  Putting the luminaire on a dedicated circuit allows you to deenergize other circuits, while maintaining good lighting while servicing the equipment.

It's a good idea (though a bit overkill), to also provide emergency lighting near the equipment.  Installing a simple fixture like this near the equipment, ensures that you won't have to fumble in the dark to flip breakers if the power ever goes out.



This unit can be installed on the same dedicated equipment luminaire circuit. That way even if you have to switch off the whole panel to do work, you'll still have light.



tl;dr


Keep an area 30"" wide, 36"" deep, and 6 1/2' high in front of the equipment clear (Working Space).
Provide ""sufficient area"" for entrance to and egress from the equipment (see local building codes to determine ""sufficient area"").
Make sure the area has enough lighting.
Rooms are defined by intended use.

Let's say I decided to be a bad boy and use a non-prime as my hashing function - take 12.

$$ H = k \bmod \ 12$$

would result in a hash table with values $0, 12, 24 \dots $ in the first bucket, $1, 13, 25 \dots$ etc. in the second and so on.

",Pacerier,https://christianity.stackexchange.com/users/102,"No. It would not be a sin, necessarily, but simply an incorrect assumption. It may be a sin to teach this, however, because it is contrary to the teachings of Scripture, and you would be leading your brothers and sisters astray.

Consider what is said in Romans 3:27-28:


  27 Where, then, is boasting? It is excluded. Because of what law? The law that requires works? No, because of the law that requires faith. 28 For we maintain that a person is justified by faith apart from the works of the law.


If one has not faith, but only has works, it does not count for their salvation. That isn't to say that works are not important, as you can look at James 2:26:


  26 As the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without deeds is dead.


If one has faith, works will naturally follow. If one's faith does not produce works, then what is that faith? Our faith should be fruitful and produce works. This is actually analogous to the story of Jesus and the fig tree in Mark 11:12-14:


  12 The next day as they were leaving Bethany, Jesus was hungry. 13 Seeing in the distance a fig tree in leaf, he went to find out if it had any fruit. When he reached it, he found nothing but leaves, because it was not the season for figs. 14 Then he said to the tree, “May no one ever eat fruit from you again.” And his disciples heard him say it.


If we are the tree, and we have no faith, it will not produce fruit (works). If we are a tree producing fruit, however, God will bless us and we will feed many (figuratively or literally, depending on the work) with the fruit of our works.

Looking around, I found that the US form is actually the more traditional Anglo-Saxon way, but the British adapted to using the European form in the early 20th Century.

But I couldn't find a definitive discussion of the history of the different formats. Is it just conventional, or is there an official 'British date standard' (like with metric and imperial, for example).

  Today is Thursday, May 24th, 2012.


Now convert the month name to a natural number, and there you have your answer. What’s today’s date?  It’s May 24th.  Instead of writing May-24, we simply change the “May” to “5” and write 5-24 or ⁵⁄₂₄.  

That way it follows the natural language order and so requires no mental gymnastics to switch things around when speaking the date aloud.  Similarly “September 11th” gets written ⁹⁄₁₁, etc.   

The full spoken form with the year, “May 24th, 2012”, then becomes the written shorthand “5/24/2012”, or often just “5/24/12”.  “Christmas of 2001” can be, and somewhat annoying often is, written “12/25/1”, while “January 25th, 2012” becomes “1/25/12”. 

This isn’t usually any sort of problem because of universal consensus on how to interpret such things in the United States.  If you write day/month/year in America, you will not be understood.  Although I myself prefer the ISO notation, normal people do not use it in their daily affairs.

4095,4095,6533,Why does hand sanitizer leave your skin feeling cool?,"I noticed, and perhaps many others have too, that the application of hand sanitizer (mainly ethanol), leaves one's hands feeling rather chilly after application. 

What is responsible for this phenomena? Is it the high heat of vaporization of hand sanitizer? However, explanation doesn't hold water; water has a standard heat of vaporization of 40.65 kJ/mol while ethanol has a heat of vaporization of 38.56 kJ/mol. 

Could it be the low boiling point of ethanol? Hand sanitizer disappears (vaporizes) within seconds upon rubbing the hands together. Water, however, does not.

817,817,1294,Array Binding simple example doesn't work,"I'm very new to xaml and I'm trying to understand the Binding issue. I have a problem with the Array Binding. I created this very simple example: I have a stack panel with three images. Each image has a RotationTransform. Each Angle is obtained by an array element (the array is a DependencyProperty called Rotations). This is the xaml simple file:

&lt;StackPanel Orientation=""Vertical""&gt;

                Click=""Op_Click""/&gt;            
    &lt;/StackPanel&gt;


And this is my c# class:

public sealed partial class MainPage : Page
    {        
        public static readonly DependencyProperty RotationsProperty = DependencyProperty.Register(""Rotations"", typeof(double[]), typeof(MainPage),
            new PropertyMetadata(new double[3]));

        public double[] Rotations
        {
            get { return (double[])GetValue(RotationsProperty); }
            set { SetValue(RotationsProperty, value); }
        }

        private void Op_Click(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
        {
            Rotations[0] = 180;
            Rotations[1] = 130;
            Rotations[2] = 350;
        }

        public MainPage()
        {
            this.InitializeComponent();
            Rotations[0] = 20;
            Rotations[1] = 90;
            Rotations[2] = 180;
        }
    }


The binding works only the first time (at startup time). When I click on the button (changing the Rotations array) the binding doesn't work and it is completely ignored from my images. 

This is a very simple example, so it's clear that I miss something concerning the Binding issue.

3615,3615,5771,Should a call to action float in a long page?,"I was reading this excellent site http://www.goodui.org/ when one of the points made me think 


  Repeating your call to action is a strategy that is more applicable to
  longer pages, or repeating across numerous pages. Surely you don't
  want to have your offer displayed 10 times all on the same screen and
  frustrate people. However, long pages are becoming the norm and the
  idea of squeezing everything ""above the fold"" is fading. It doesn't
  hurt to have one soft actionable item at the top, and another
  prominent one at the bottom. When people reach the bottom, they pause
  and think what to do next - a potential solid place to make an offer
  or close a deal.
  
  


While I think this is a good solution in which you have a reasonably sized page where you can reach the top or bottom in three-four scrolls, what if you have a really long page. Do we really know if users will scroll all the way to the bottom and then make a decision ? In that case wont it be better to have a floating call to action button which allows them to do an action at any point of time ? 

Please do note I am not suggesting this button should hide any text or  content but it would float at the side where it is visible but not in the way.

583,583,910,Calculating pH of diprotic and amphoteric solutions,"I am trying to understand this problem and its corresponding solution (complete solution not shown)





First off, from the above one can see that the equilibrium constants when $\ce{H2ASO4-}$ donates and receives a proton are as follows:
\begin{aligned}
\ce{H2AsO4 &amp;&lt;=&gt; HAsO4^{2-} + H+} &amp; K_2 &amp;= 1.1 \cdot 10^{−7}\\
\ce{H2AsO4- + H+ &amp;&lt;=&gt; H3AsO4}    &amp; K_{-1} &amp;= 1.6 \cdot 10^{2}\\
\end{aligned}

However, if this is an amphoteric substance as the solution claims, shouldn't both $K_a$ values be comparable? It seems logical that if it is able to act as both an acid and a base, the equilibrium constants should at least be similar to each other. Instead, one is several order of magnitudes larger than the other? Why can this be true and $\ce{H2ASO4-}$ still be an amphoteric substance?



Next, how did they arrive at the statement


  We approximately have the equality relation: $$\ce{[H3AsO4]} = \ce{[HAsO4^{2−}]}$$


What is the evidence that shows this to be true? Isn't the $K_a$ value of the basic reaction ($1.6 \times 10^2$) much larger than that of the acidic reaction? Why should the concentrations be equal?



Finally, let's say you are calculating the pH for the diprotic substance $\ce{H2S}$, which undergoes the following diassociations:

$$\ce{H2S &lt;=&gt; H+ + HS-}$$
$$\ce{HS- &lt;=&gt; H+ + S^{2-}}$$

To find the pH you would assume that the first reaction is dominant, and that the effects of the second reaction consuming $\ce{HS-}$ are minimal, and then calculate the pH from there — right? 

However, why can't you treat $\ce{HS-}$ as an amphoteric substance (because it can both gain and lose a proton) and then calculate the pH as you would for an amphoteric substance (as seen in the image at the beginning)?
",1110101001,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/users/2142,"I'll address your questions in 3 parts: 

(A) Why amphoteric

(B) How to solve the problem without making unexplained assumptions

(C) Why the solution in the book uses the approximate equality
    $\ce{[H3AsO4]=[HAsO4^{2-}]}$.

PART (A)

An amphoteric species (molecule or ion) is one that can either gain a proton with relative ease, or lose a proton with relative ease. ""Relative ease"" means, for example, that it can happen in aqueous solution. If your species will gain a proton in the presence of enough $\ce{H3O+}$, and if it will lose a proton in the present of enough $\ce{OH-}$, it can certainly be called amphoteric.

Translated into equilibrium constants, if your species has a pKa between 0 and 14, and its conjugate acid (what you get when you protonate it) also has a (necessarily lower) $pK_a$ between 0 and 14, your species will act in aqueous solution as either as an acid (losing a proton in the presence of strong base) or as a base (gaining a proton in the presence of strong acid).

The $pK_a$ of (neutral) arsenic acid is between 2 and 3 (because the equilibrium constant for removing the first proton, $K_1$, is between $10^{-2}$ and $10^{-3}$). The $pK_a$ of the version that lost one proton, $\ce{H2AsO4-}$, is around 7 (from the value of $K_2$). So clearly $\ce{H2AsO4-}$ will gain a proton if the pH is below 1, say, and it will lose a proton if the pH is above 10. This justifies why it's amphoteric.

PART (B)

In a monoprotic acid like HF, all the F appears either as F$^-$ or as HF (two species). You can write down 1 equilibrium equation, a mass balance for F and a charge balance, and solve all three equations simultaneously; when you combine the three you get a quadratic equation that can be solved exactly.

But with a multiprotic acid, things get complicated fast. In this problem you have three equilibrium equations, plus the mass-balance and charge-balance equations.  That's 5 equations in 5 variables.

Fortunately it's possible to combine 4 of them easily, using only high-school algebra. They are the 3 equilibrium equations and the charge balance. This reduces the problem to two variables (the pH and the concentration of one of the arsenic ions) in two equations.

Let's write and combine the 4 equations. There are four arsenic species with varying charges; I'll call their concentrations $A_0,A_1,A_2,A_3$ -- the index denotes the charge (which is 3 minus the number of hydrogens). So $A_0=[\ce{H3AsO4}]$, $A_1=[\ce{H2AsO4-}]$, and so on.

By definition, $A_1[\ce{H^+}]/A_0=K_1$, or equivalently $A_0=A_1[\ce{H^+}]/K_1$. This relates two concentrations, $A_0$ and $A_1$. Similarly $A_1=A_2[\ce{H^+}]/K_2$ and $A_2=A_3[\ce{H^+}]/K_3$.

The important thing is that all these four concentrations are proportional and given one you can find all others if you know the pH. (We don't know the pH, but I'll address that in a moment.)

The charge balance (expressed in moles present in 1 L of solution) is simply 
\begin{equation} 0\,A_0+ 1\,A_1+ 2\,A_2+ 3\,A_3+K_w/[\ce{H^+}]= [\ce{H^+}]+0.1. 
\end{equation}
On the left we have the negative charges, on the right the positive ones. Notes:


The concentration of each arsenic species is multiplied by its charge, obviously.
On the left side, $K_w=10^{-14}$ is the dissociation product of water, and $K_w/[\ce{H^+}]$ represents the concentration of OH$^-$; it will turn out to be negligible, but we don't know that a priori, and including it doesn't make the problem any harder.
The 0.1 on the right comes from Na$^+$ ions; being an alkali metal, sodium does not exist in water solution except in ionic form, so we know [Na$^+$] exactly. This explains something that will be important later: The 0.10 M solution of $\ce{NaH2AsO4}$ is exactly what you obtain by dissolving 0.10 moles of NaOH in one beaker, 0.10 moles of $\ce{H3AsO4}$ in another, and mixing the two, assuming the combined volume is 1 L.


Now we express the left side of (1) in terms of just two
concentrations, $A_3$ and $\ce{[H^+]}$: $$
\begin{aligned}A_1+2\,A_2+3\,A_3&amp;=(\ce{[H^+]}/K_1)\,A_2+2\,A_2+3\,A_3\\
&amp;=(\ce{[H^+]}/K_1+2)\,A_2+3\,A_3\\
&amp;=(\ce{[H^+]}/K_1+2)(\ce{[H^+]}/K_2)\,A_3+3\,A_3\\
&amp;= \bigl((\ce{[H^+]}/K_1+2)(\ce{[H^+]}/K_2)+3\bigr)\,A_3
. \end{aligned} $$

The last line is the key; it allows us to relate the concentration of one arsenic
species to the pH.  With this (and moving the $K_w/\ce{[H+]}$ to the
right)
the charge balance becomes
$$ \bigl((\ce{[H^+]}/K_1+2)(\ce{[H^+]}/K_2)+3\bigr)\,A_3
=\ce{[H^+]}+0.1 -K_w/\ce{[H+]}$$
or again
$$ A_3=
=\frac{\ce{[H^+]}+0.1 -K_w/\ce{[H+]}}{\bigl((\ce{[H^+]}/K_1+2)(\ce{[H^+]}/K_2)+3\bigr).}$$

This look complicated, but it's easy to put into a spreadsheet. The last step is this: The right [H$^+$] is the one that, with $A_3$ calculated as above, obeys the mass balance, $$ A_3 + A_2 + A_1 + A_0 =0.1.$$

At this point we could declare the multiple-choice problem solved, by cheating a bit: take the various proposed values of  [H$^+$] and see which one works.  For answer (a) the value of the sum $ A_3 + A_2 + A_1 + A_0$ is 0.62; for (b) it is  0.128; for (c) it is 0.10165, and for (d) it is 0.100002.  So the best answer is (d).

What if you didn't have multiple choice? Then you'd want to draw a graph or a table, taking (say) every integer value of pH and connecting them.  Here is such a graph: 



The horizontal axis is pH and the vertical one is total arsenic concentration.  The correct pH is where the vertical coordinate is exactly 0.1, and you can get a good idea of its value by eyeballing, or solve by successive approximations.

Note that this method allows you to solve with no more effort the following problem: what is the pH when you add 0.1 mol/L of $\ce{NaH2AsO4}$ (as in the original problem), plus 0.05 mol/L of $\ce{H3AsO4}$?  The only difference is that now you'll be looking for the point on the graph where the vertical coordinate is 0.1+0.05 = 0.15, instead of 0.1.

PART (C)

Why does the book say that $\ce{[H3AsO4]=[HAsO4^{2-}]}$, approximately? And is this a good approximation?

The equality comes from the claim that the ""dominant reactivity"" of $\ce{[H2AsO4-]}$ is $$\ce{2\,H2AsO4- \leftrightharpoons H3AsO4{}+HAsO4^{2-}}.$$ If $\ce{H2AsO4-}$ exchanges protons only with itself, and not with, say, water, then every proton lost by one $\ce{H2AsO4-}$ ion means a proton gained by another $\ce{H2AsO4-}$, and the result is that $\ce{[H3AsO4]}$ and $\ce{[HAsO4^{2-}]}$ are generated in equal amounts.

So given the claim about ""dominant reactivity"", the equality is true, and by the way, the equality implies that the pH is the average of $pK_1$ and $pK_2$. (This follows, by taking logs, from the analysis that I'm guessing your book gives right after the part of the solution you quoted.)

The problem with the claim is that it does not follow from the amphoteric nature of $\ce{H2AsO4^-}$ alone. It requires two additional conditions: You're starting from only $\ce{H2AsO4-}$, and in relatively high concentrations. I'll illustrate why these conditions are necessary:

(1) You have to start with only $\ce{H2AsO4-}$ (plus a counterion that doesn't participate further, like Na$^+$). If you started with some $\ce{H3AsO4}$ in addition, you wouldn't have the equality $\ce{[H3AsO4]=[HAsO4^{2-}]}$, even approximately. Or, to use the example you gave, if you start with H$_2$S the amphoteric character of HS$^-$ wont help you calculate the pH of the resulting mix. On the other hand if you started by dissolving NaHS alone, it would.

(2) You have to start with a strong solution. If the original question had specified a 0.1 mM solution instead of a 0.1 M solution, the resulting H$^+$ concentration would not be $2.5\times 10^{-5}$ anymore but $3.3\times 10^{-6}$, and the equality $\ce{[H3AsO4]=[HAsO4^{2-}]}$ would be off by a factor of 60!

I hope this helps answer your very interesting and perceptive questions.  Don't hesitate to ask for further clarification if necessary!

(A) Why amphoteric

(B) How to solve the problem without making unexplained assumptions

(C) Why the solution in the book uses the approximate equality
    $\ce{[H3AsO4]=[HAsO4^{2-}]}$.

PART (A)

An amphoteric species (molecule or ion) is one that can either gain a proton with relative ease, or lose a proton with relative ease. ""Relative ease"" means, for example, that it can happen in aqueous solution. If your species will gain a proton in the presence of enough $\ce{H3O+}$, and if it will lose a proton in the present of enough $\ce{OH-}$, it can certainly be called amphoteric.

Translated into equilibrium constants, if your species has a pKa between 0 and 14, and its conjugate acid (what you get when you protonate it) also has a (necessarily lower) $pK_a$ between 0 and 14, your species will act in aqueous solution as either as an acid (losing a proton in the presence of strong base) or as a base (gaining a proton in the presence of strong acid).

The $pK_a$ of (neutral) arsenic acid is between 2 and 3 (because the equilibrium constant for removing the first proton, $K_1$, is between $10^{-2}$ and $10^{-3}$). The $pK_a$ of the version that lost one proton, $\ce{H2AsO4-}$, is around 7 (from the value of $K_2$). So clearly $\ce{H2AsO4-}$ will gain a proton if the pH is below 1, say, and it will lose a proton if the pH is above 10. This justifies why it's amphoteric.

PART (B)

In a monoprotic acid like HF, all the F appears either as F$^-$ or as HF (two species). You can write down 1 equilibrium equation, a mass balance for F and a charge balance, and solve all three equations simultaneously; when you combine the three you get a quadratic equation that can be solved exactly.

But with a multiprotic acid, things get complicated fast. In this problem you have three equilibrium equations, plus the mass-balance and charge-balance equations.  That's 5 equations in 5 variables.

Fortunately it's possible to combine 4 of them easily, using only high-school algebra. They are the 3 equilibrium equations and the charge balance. This reduces the problem to two variables (the pH and the concentration of one of the arsenic ions) in two equations.

Let's write and combine the 4 equations. There are four arsenic species with varying charges; I'll call their concentrations $A_0,A_1,A_2,A_3$ -- the index denotes the charge (which is 3 minus the number of hydrogens). So $A_0=[\ce{H3AsO4}]$, $A_1=[\ce{H2AsO4-}]$, and so on.

By definition, $A_1[\ce{H^+}]/A_0=K_1$, or equivalently $A_0=A_1[\ce{H^+}]/K_1$. This relates two concentrations, $A_0$ and $A_1$. Similarly $A_1=A_2[\ce{H^+}]/K_2$ and $A_2=A_3[\ce{H^+}]/K_3$.

The important thing is that all these four concentrations are proportional and given one you can find all others if you know the pH. (We don't know the pH, but I'll address that in a moment.)

The charge balance (expressed in moles present in 1 L of solution) is simply 
\begin{equation} 0\,A_0+ 1\,A_1+ 2\,A_2+ 3\,A_3+K_w/[\ce{H^+}]= [\ce{H^+}]+0.1. 
\end{equation}
On the left we have the negative charges, on the right the positive ones. Notes:


The concentration of each arsenic species is multiplied by its charge, obviously.

&amp;= \bigl((\ce{[H^+]}/K_1+2)(\ce{[H^+]}/K_2)+3\bigr)\,A_3
. \end{aligned} $$

The last line is the key; it allows us to relate the concentration of one arsenic
species to the pH.  With this (and moving the $K_w/\ce{[H+]}$ to the
right)
the charge balance becomes
$$ \bigl((\ce{[H^+]}/K_1+2)(\ce{[H^+]}/K_2)+3\bigr)\,A_3
=\ce{[H^+]}+0.1 -K_w/\ce{[H+]}$$
or again
$$ A_3=
=\frac{\ce{[H^+]}+0.1 -K_w/\ce{[H+]}}{\bigl((\ce{[H^+]}/K_1+2)(\ce{[H^+]}/K_2)+3\bigr).}$$

Are you willing to burn a bridge?


Typically, as lead PI you are responsible for the execution of the entire project, not just your portion, and therefore have a responsibility to your funding agency to appropriately manage your subcontracting collaborators.  If the funding agency has instead decided to execute independent contracts to each of the PIs in the grant, then it is largely out of your hands and there is little that you can (or should) do.

Assuming you are lead PI, then if the contract (not the proposal) has requirements in its statement of work that they are not meeting by the given milestone deadlines, then you have much more leverage and a clear case for a ""shape up or get defunded"" conversation.  Similarly, if the funding agency is exerting strong oversight (e.g., in the USA, DARPA often threatens de-funding unless you meet strong milestones by particular frequent deadlines or regularly outperform other research teams; NSF has a much looser oversight process that often just wants to see that something interesting is being accomplished) then you have a strong case that their failure to perform is directly imperiling the whole research project.  In either case, as lead PI you have both the right and the responsibility to cancel their funding and redirect it to better accomplish the research tasks that you are being held accountable for.  

If the contract doesn't have accountable goals and you aren't being held accountable for their behavior, however, then it is more just a moral offense to you, and you have much less basis on which to legitimately defund your colleagues.

2431,2431,3878,Understanding the static keyword,"I have some experience in developing with Java, Javascript and PHP.

I am reading Microsoft Visual C# 2010 Step by Step which I feel it is a very good book on introducing you to the C# language.

I seem to be having problems in understanding the static keyword. From what I understand this far if a class is declared static all methods and variable have to be static. The main method always is a static method so in the class that the main method exists all variables and methods are declared static if you have to call them in the main method. Also I have noticed that in order to call a static method from another class you do not need to create an object of that you can use the class name.

What are the advantages of declaring static variables and methods?

When should I declare static variable and methods?
",Nistor Alexandru,https://programmers.stackexchange.com/users/52164,"The static keyword in C# is refering to something in the class, or the class itself, that is shared amongst all instances of the class.  For example, a field that is marked as static can be accessed from all instances of that class through the class name.

public class SomeObject
{
    //Static Field
    static int Foo = 3;

    //instance field
    private int _Foo2 = 4;

    //instance property
    public int Foo2{get{return _Foo2;}set{_Foo2 = value;}}


    //static constructor
    public static SomeObject CreateSomeObject(int fooValue)
    {
        SomeObject retVal = new SomeObject();

I can honestly say that I have never used a class marked as static with the exception of creating extention methods (Quick tutorial on extension methods).

Anyways, there are specific design patterns for utilizing static methods, such as factory pattern and singleton pattern, but the important thing to remember is that static methods and constructors do not deal with any specific instance of a class (unless you pass one in).  So utilizing static methods is more of a stateless implementation of a methods, e.g. to do calculations or to do a comparison between objects. The ""Main"" method you are refering to is always static, but to see it from a different point of view, see this article.

To follow up with this, here is how the difference between static and instantiated methods, fields and properties are called.

public static void Main(string[] args)
{
    //This is a static method that starts a thread in an application
    // space.  At this point not everything actually has to be static...

    //Here is an instantiation with a parameterless contruction
    SomeObject obj = new SomeObject();

    //Here is an instantiation using a static contructor (factory)
    SomeObject obj2 = SomeObject.CreateSomeObject(3);

    //Getting field value from static field
    // Notice that this references the class name, not an instance
    int fooValue1 = SomeObject.Foo;

    //Getting property value from instance
    //  Note that this references an object instance
    int fooValue2 = obj2.Foo2;

    //Instance method must be called through an object
    obj2.AddSomething(4);  //if default constructor, would return 8

    //Static methods must be called through class name

1284,1284,2026,Squid proxy: how to link inbound IPv4+port to outbound IPv6,"I'm trying to setup a squid proxy that will accept multiple inbound connections on one IPv4 across a range of ports, and for each port connection to connect out on a unique IPv6 address.

I've named each port connection, and designated an ACL based on the connection name, and then I've tried to define an outgoing IPv6 for each. The script below works, in that it accepts connections on the different ports and routes out via IPv6 however, all outbound connections use the same IPv6 (user5) even though there are different ipv6 defined per user - the wierd bit is that even if I comment-out that user5 IPv6 from squid.conf, it still gets used for outbound connections.

721,721,1142,How to describe the differences in skewed data with same median but statistically different distribution?,"I am comparing length of stay after laparoscopic and open appendectomy in over 160000 patients. LOS is typically a skewed variable so I use the median and interquartile range and ranksum test to describe the result, which is 2, IQR 2-3 and 2, IQR 2-4, p&lt;0.0001. So there is a highly significant difference but it does not show that well in the median and IQR. 

The difference in length of stay is very small. This finding is a negative finding but still interesting as it goes against what most people think about LOS after laparoscopic appendectomy. That is why I want to report on the difference in LOS which is not evident if I only report median and IQR with p-value.

The arithmetic mean (3.1 vs 2.8 and a difference of 0.3 days) is not recommended as the distribution is skewed. I wonder if any other measure could be used like, geometric mean (2.5 vs 2.3, difference 0.2 days) or harmonic mean (2.1 vs 1.9 days, difference 0.2 days)?  When can I use geometric mean or harmonic mean? 

I am inclined to use the harmonic mean which comes closest to the median and gives a difference of 0.2 days. Is this incorrect?

Different approaches was proposed for modelling using quantile or Cox-regression. 

I proposed poisson regression but ended up with negative binomial regression as the data showed evidence of overdispersion. This allowed me to compare the unadjusted difference of 0.3 days with difference after adjusting for age, sex, perforated appendicitis and period, which came down to a difference of only 0.05 days between the two surgical methods.

I created the following procedure to insert all records from my XML string into my table which works well so far. 

Can someone tell me how I have to change this so that it only inserts a record as new if the itemID (every record in my XML has this as well) does not yet exist in my table, column itemID - otherwise it should update the existing record with the new data from the XML.

5725,5725,9068,Why would a sump pump cycle when pumping large amounts of water?,"In my septic system, I have a sump pump that pumps the liquid into the drainage field. We have a tank alarm in this tank with the pump, but someone (not sure if it was me or someone else) forgot to turn back on the alarm one time. So now that 1000 gallon tank is over flowing. The pump circuit has been blowing for me at the fuse box. It seems to blow the circuit based on getting a bunch of rain. I'll do a separate question for that.

My question is this. I can hear the pump run for a bit (I haven't kept track of the time) then stop. After a while it will start again. Is there a safety or something that would cause the pump to not run until there is no water left? This happens no matter if the float is hooked up or I am just plugged in straight. Or could it be the drainage field is full of water and needs to seep out so there is room for more?

I know the tank isn't empty cause shortly after the pump stops, water starts seeping out of the lid again. (and the alarm light is still on).

you must extend BaseInputConnection and wrap the original webview's InputConnection
don't use InputConnectionWrapper as it will cause other problems
you need to subclass a second method: commitText

1177,1177,1850,1/4 to 1/8 jack problem,"I was planning to record months ago, with my electric guitar, and yesterday I got myself a guitar rig software and bought some 1/4 to 1/8 adapter jack so that I can plug in unto my laptop's mic hole.

Whenever I plug my guitar cable to the 1/4 to 1/8 adapter then to the laptop I can't hear any sound (past the clicking sound you hear) but when I plug the cable almost halfway of the adapter's body (before the clicking sound) I can hear sound when I play and there's some loud buzzing sound involved.

Any explanations as to why this is happening?

Sounds like (haw!) a mono-to-stereo problem. Look at the 1/4 inch plug. How many parts? The tip connector and the sleeve right behind the tip? Now look at the 1/8 inch plug. Two sleeves?

If yes, you are shorting out one of the channels. Go back to the shop and look for a 1/4 mono to 1/8 stereo adapter, preferably with a short cord to take the load off the laptop's input.

Each hex cell has a height value used to determine if it's water or ocean. I'm trying to think of a good way to determine and label bodies of water.

But what about bodies of water like the Mediterranean? Bodies of water that are attached to larger ones (where ""seas"" and ""gulfs"" differ only by the size of the opening)?

Here's an example of what I'm trying to detect (the blue body of water in the middle of the image, which should be labelled differently from the larger body of ocean on the left, despite being technically connected):

What I am attempting to do, is to get hold of the values returned by ""df -h"", and to be able to store these values in a bash script array. The purpose is to combine it with other data (like the current timestamp) and output this to a new file/overwrite an existing file. 

The following two commands give me what I want on the commandline, but I cannot for the life of me load the output into an array that I can iterate over.

The followng gives me the disk utilization in percent for each disk: 

df -h | grep -vE ""^Filesystem|shm|boot"" |  awk '{ print +$5 }'


And the following gives me the disk path: 

df -h | grep -vE ""^Filesystem|shm|boot"" |  awk '{ print $6 }'

5381,5381,8547,Can't verify signature in JAVA but success in .NET,"We have old system using .NET 3.5 (run on Windows Server 2003 32bits) to verify e-receipts from our customers (all use SHA1RSA algorithm as agreement). We store their certificates in database in Base64 string. Old code look like that:

//Store certificates
String certificateEncodeBase64 = Convert.ToBase64String(byteArrayCertificateFile);

//Verify signatures

//Hash algorithm SHA-1
HashAlgorithm hashAlgrothm = new SHA1Managed();
//Data
byte[] data = System.Text.Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(request.DataInUTF8);

//Verify using algorithm RSA
RSACryptoServiceProvider pubKey = (RSACryptoServiceProvider)certificate.PublicKey.Key    
bool vr = pubKey.VerifyData(data, hashAlgrothm, signature);


Nothing issues except the performance is not good. That's why we want to move to new system using Java 1.7 (run on Windows Server 2012 64 bits). Our new code look like that:

//Using the same DB store certificates

//Verify signatures using Bouncy Castle JCE Provider

//Hash data using SHA-1
byte[] data_ = request.getDataInUTF8().getBytes(""UTF-8"");
MessageDigest messageDigest_ = MessageDigest.getInstance(""SHA-1"", ""BC"");

//Signature

byte[] buffer = new BASE64Decoder().decodeBuffer(certEncodeBase64);
ByteArrayInputStream byteArrayCertificateInputStream = new ByteArrayInputStream(buffer);
Certificate certificate = certificateFactory.generateCertificate(byteArrayCertificateInputStream);
//Verify using algorithm RSA
Signature verifyEngine = Signature.getInstance(""RSA"", ""BC"");
verifyEngine.initVerify(certificate);
verifyEngine.update(hashed);
result = verifyEngine.verify(signature);

The documentation suggests that you should probably be using SHA1withRSA as the signature algorithm. This is further indicated by the signature vs. expected.

Net","We have old system using .NET 3.5 (run on Windows Server 2003 32bits) to verify e-receipts from our customers (all use SHA1RSA algorithm as agreement). We store their certificates in database in Base64 string. Old code look like that:

//Store certificates
String certificateEncodeBase64 = Convert.ToBase64String(byteArrayCertificateFile);

//Verify signatures

//Hash algorithm SHA-1
HashAlgorithm hashAlgrothm = new SHA1Managed();

Nothing issues except the performance is not good. That's why we want to move to new system using Java 1.7 (run on Windows Server 2012 64 bits). Our new code look like that:

//Verify signatures using Bouncy Castle JCE Provider

//Hash data using SHA-1

Certificate certificate = certificateFactory.generateCertificate(byteArrayCertificateInputStream);
//Verify using algorithm RSA
Signature verifyEngine = Signature.getInstance(""RSA"", ""BC"");
verifyEngine.initVerify(certificate);
verifyEngine.update(hashed);

1315,1315,2079,Persistent Connection Attempts By Akamai Technologies,"I have seen this question asked in different places, but have never seen a satisfactory answer:

On different computer builds, ASUS/GIGABYTE/MSI, I constantly have outgoing connections to XXX-XXX-XXX.deploy.static.akamaitechnologies.com over HTTP Port 80, and if the connection attempts are denied, the network card (or at least internet connectivity) stops working... LAN connections still appear to work. The outgoing connections occur on every restart, and must be allowed for the network card to function properly. If the attempts are denied, the system must be restated so that the connections will be attempted again and can be allowed.

This post suggests narrowing down an offending application, but I don't see how akamai technologies can be so intertwined in so many systems, cut-off connectivity if not allowed, etc. Something about it feels like unauthorized (or at least unwanted) information transfer, at the very least a phone-home, but I have no Wirshark captures to confirm this :)

My primary guess after looking at all the symptoms: the connection attempt is trying to see if there is internet connectivity, and if the attempt fails Windows assumes there is none... But this sounds really, really dumb.

$(x,y) \subseteq Ker(\phi)$ is obvious, but to prove the reverse inclusion, my idea is to take a polynomial $p(x,y) \in Ker(\phi)$ and to perform Euclidean division of $p(x,y)$ with $y$ and $x$ in $(\mathbb{Q}[x])[y]$ and $(\mathbb{Q}[y])[x]$ respectively.

2030,2030,3236,Do dice finish resolving before yielding Tokyo?,"When does yielding occur in relation to dice resolution? Simultaneously? After all dice have resolved? After attack dice are resolved?

For example (A for attack die, H for heart):

Alice is outside Tokyo, Bob is inside. It is now Alice's turn.
Alice rolls: 3, 3, 3, A, A, H
? Handle VP and hearts?
Alice attacks Bob
Bob chooses to yield


Now consider the possibility Alice has a single shrink ray token, so she only rolls 5 dice:

Alice is outside Tokyo, Bob is inside. It is now Alice's turn.
Alice rolls: 3, 3, 3, A, H
? Handle VP and hearts?
Alice attacks Bob
Bob chooses to yield


She must choose if the heart is applied to heal for one, or if it will remove the shrink ray token. In this case, order of resolution for the attack/yield and heart matters (more/less information for Alice &amp; Bob, inability to heal in Tokyo). Is there an order to the dice resolution (eg hearts then attacks), or is the yield not declared until after all dice have resolved?
",thegrinner,https://boardgames.stackexchange.com/users/3101,"It is my opinion that the dice indicate what happens to you at your current location. A heart dice would indicate that you healed, if your location permits it. 

This is partially supported by the fact that one must take all damage rolled even if one cedes Tokyo. You should similarly be able to use all hearts even if you are forced to take Tokyo. There's absolutely no mention or implication of any other possibility.

No, it doesn't. According to the FAQ on BoardGameGeek, removing a bad counter counts as healing and is thus equally forbidden in Tokyo, so the order does not affect the choice.

A heart dice would indicate that you healed, if your location permits it. 

This is partially supported by the fact that one must take all damage rolled even if one cedes Tokyo. You should similarly be able to use all hearts even if you are forced to take Tokyo. There's absolutely no mention or implication of any other possibility.

4325,4325,6890,WD Black 2.5 sata drive slow on windows 8. Sector size is 4k. What gives? 40MBps write,"WD Black 2.5 sata drive slow on windows 8. Sector size is 4k. What gives? 40MBps write.
This is a brand new WD black scorpion 500gb drive, on a brand new Zotac Zbox Nano CI320, quad core with 4gb of ram and Windows 8.1 x64.

Take a look at the pic and see from left are two USB 3.0 external drives and the last is my internal sata C drive that is showing issues. SMART scan came back A-ok! Kind of clueless here.



Update Back with some better news, after uninstalling the drive in device manager, booting into safemode then out again, I got this and confirmed it through about 4 more of the tests:
*note: the dip in data speed towards the end was from me doing something else with the drive while testing.


Update Tested again after 20 minutes since test above, it's back to slow 40mbps write speed :(
Testing on another system now! Then RMA if need be.

As it stands now: Sometimes getting full speed, mostly getting capped 40MBps write :(

Could someone please take a look at the SMART data and tell me if anything looks off to you?


Well guys, I think I've finally figured it out. It seems to have been a temp issue. I took some action to reduce temps, and attached two big solid copper blocks with thermal paste to the label side of the hdd. Temps now are going from 50c-60c variably. I'm probably going to make use of my eSata port on this thing, and relocate the internal drive to an external enclosure and eventually put in an SSD in the near future. :) My guess was the drive was going into a low power mode to reduce temps. That's the only thing I can think of.

It would show faster, almost normal write speed for a short while after boot (the system has been turned off for a few hours before that). Then only the write speed will start fluctuating and then go slow again. If this is the case here I would test on a different system to confirm the results and if there is no change - go for RMA.
However if it's performing as expected in safe mode for a long period of time, you should dig into Windows. It could be a driver, but it could also be a process. It could also be due to insufficient power, but that usually happens with external drives.

Obviously this depends on a multitude of factors, including the kinds of creatures in your deck, the kinds of non-creatures you have available, and the overall composition of the block you're drafting. Nonetheless, what's a good baseline for the number of creatures in a draft deck? And how should I decide if I need to run more or fewer creatures than the baseline?

Non-creature bombs (such as equipments, token generators),

3262,3262,5200,Angular $http promise not resolving,"I am currently working on building a login flow in AngularJS 1.3.  My problem is that the promise return from an $http call is not resolving the code inside of its '.then'.

I am working to handle error messages that come back from the server, specifically to handle any 401 errors which are returned when the user has input the wrong username or password.  However, when a 401 is returned, the .then never resolves itself and the code within them never runs.

The relevant code is as follows:

The controller for the login form as a login function on its scope, as follows:

$scope.login = function() {
    $scope.authError = null;

    // Try to login
    var promise = session.login($scope.user);

    promise.then(function(loggedIn) {

        // THIS CODE NEVER RUNS

        if ( !loggedIn ) {
            $scope.authError = localizedMessages.get('login.error.invalidCredentials');
        }

    }, function(x) {
        $scope.authError = localizedMessages.get('login.error.serverError', { exception: x });
    });
};


I have a session factory that takes care of the login and other session based needs.  The code for login is:

login: function(credentials) {
    var $http = $injector.get('$http');
    var url = ENV.apiEndpoint + ""/sessions"";

    var newSession = $http.post(url, credentials);

    return newSession.then(function(data) {
        session.set(data.token);

        //THIS CODE ONLY RUNS ON A SUCCESS RESPONSE

        if(session.isAuthenticated()) {
            closeLoginModal(true);
        }

        return session.isAuthenticated();
    });
}


I have placed comments in the code where the problem is. I am at a loss as to why this code isn't working.  From my understanding of promises, then 'then' should resolve no matter what the response was, success of error.  

I have an interceptor running, but I have tried disabling it with no luck to the end result.

Am I missing something?

523,523,824,Prove that any real function defined on a real open interval has at most countably many simple discontinuities.,"This is problem 17 in baby Rudin's chapter on continuity. He has a hint to use triplets of rationals that bound each simple discontinuity on the left, right, and in between the values of the limits from the left and right. It seems like this can be weakened to just rationals to the left and right. 

Simple discontinuities are those in which the limit from the left and right exist, so there must be intervals to the left and right of a simple continuity on which no other simple discontinuity can exist. More precisely, let $c$ and $c'$ be simple discontinuities for $f$ on $(a,b)$ and consider the limit, $l$, of $f$ approaching $c$ from the left:

$\forall \epsilon &gt;0, \exists \delta&gt;0 : c-x&lt;\delta \Rightarrow |l-f(x)|&lt;\epsilon$

but $ \exists \epsilon '&gt;0 \forall \delta ' &gt;0 : |c'-x|&lt;\delta ' \Rightarrow |f(c')-f(x)|&gt;\epsilon '
\\ \therefore \epsilon = \epsilon ' , \delta ' = \delta \rightarrow \leftarrow
$

Therefore, you can make an injection from the set of simple discontinuities to a subset of rationals by associating each simple discontinuity with one rational in the aforementioned ""free"" interval to its left; from there compose with the map from rationals to integers to show countable. Is this argument correct?
",user2303321,https://math.stackexchange.com/users/84960,"
  so there must be intervals to the left and right of a simple continuity on which no other simple discontinuity can exist.


That is incorrect. Consider an enumeration $r_n$ of the rationals, and let

$$f(x) = \sum_{\substack{n \in \mathbb{N}\\r_n &lt; x}} 2^{-n}.$$

Then $f$ is a strictly monotonic function that has a jump discontinuity in every rational number.

However, as the points of discontinuity approach any fixed $y \in \mathbb{R}$, the jumps tend to $0$, in fact, the sum of all jumps in the discontinuities $\neq y$ contained in a neighbourhood of $y$ tends to $0$ when the neighbourhood shrinks to a point.

[EDIT - 06/29/2012]

I believe you have your PHP OOP logic incorrect, but I could be wrong. You're defining a property in a child class which extends a parent class. You then call the parent constructor inside the child constructor. 

The code you provided shows that you assign the child class property $plugin_basename, but then you don't do anything with it after that.

I'm assuming you're trying to set a property $plugin_basename for the parent class to handle. However, if that's the case, then you need to either define the property within the parent class, OR you need to call the parent method which makes use the property $plugin_basename. 

If that's NOT the case, then you need to be sure you make use of the property $plugin_basename, within the child class, AFTER it's been assigned like so: $this-&gt;child_class_method_name($this-&gt;plugin_basename);

You could access the parent class method which handles the property $plugin_basename, and pass the property assigned by the child class to the parent class method like so: $this-&gt;parent_class_method_name($this-&gt;plugin_basename);

I'm not really too certain how you have your plugin setup, given the minimal amount of code you provided. 

If you could provide more of an idea of what you do with the property $plugin_basename, after it's been assigned, I could possibly be of more assistance.

My problem with this equation is that I don't know the moment of inertia and I'm not exactly sure how to calculate it.

Is my approach to this problem correct?

",user,https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/27600,"The moment of inertia, $I$, is, of course, given by 

$$I = \sum m_i r_i^2$$

where the sum is over every bit, $i$, of the object with mass, $m_i$, and at a distance, $r_i$, from the axis of rotation.

You might need to calculate this by integration. 

$$I = \int_x ~r(x)^2 \rho dx$$

where

$$m = \int_x \rho dx$$

You integrate along the pendulum in infinitessimal steps of $dx$ and $r(x)$ is the function that determines $r$ as a function of $x$  and $\rho$ is density so $\rho dx = dm$, where $dm$ is the infinitessimal bit of mass at $dx$.

It oscillates with only a small amplitude, so I think the motion is harmonic, so I try to use the equation $$t = 2 \ PI (\ sqrt {(\ frac {I support} {MGK})} $$, where k is the distance from the point of rotation to the center of mass. The problem with this equation is that I don't know the moment of inertia or how to calculate it.","The moment of inertia, $I$, is, of course, given by 

$$I = \sum m_i r_i^2$$

where the sum is over every bit, $i$, of the object with mass, $m_i$, and at a distance, $r_i$, from the axis of rotation.

You might need to calculate this by integration. 

$$I = \int_x ~r(x)^2 \rho dx$$

where

$$m = \int_x \rho dx$$

You integrate along the pendulum in infinitessimal steps of $dx$ and $r(x)$ is the function that determines $r$ as a function of $x$  and $\rho$ is density so $\rho dx = dm$, where $dm$ is the infinitessimal bit of mass at $dx$.

4328,4328,6893,jQuery AJAX IE - skipped functions ajax,"$(""#multiselect"").hide();

Above 2 functions inside the $(""#list"").click() block are being skipped for some reason in IE, not FF, Chrome

$(""#list"").click(function() 
{           
    var selection = $(this).val();

    $(""#multiselect"").hide();

        success: function (json) 
        {

            $(""#multiselect"").show();

            //parse json
        } 
    });//json
});


What's going on:

There is a button #list and a container #multiselect_container which holds #multiselect which is a select box of it's container's size.

When #list is clicked, the select box is hidden and the container beneath it is shown, with a loading bar.

When the ajax call is finished the loading bar is removed and the select box is shown again.

In Firefox this works perfectly fine. In IE it does not.

Things that I have tried:


$('#list').ajaxComplete(function() {}); in the success section
Sleeping the php file for 3 seconds. Same results, except with a delay.
Removing the ajax block, those 2 calls are made properly.
caching is not the issue, ajax calls are being made

4624,4624,7334,Another instructor is pushing me out of the classroom right after my class ends,"I am a graduate student in math in my final year, and for several years have been teaching at my department as a lecturer. This semester, in the same lecture hall there is another lecture that starts 20 minutes after my class ends. It's taught by another instructor from my department. I usually have many students coming to office hours and there are also students asking questions immediately after lecture. Due to other activities, I cannot have office hours right after the lecture this semester and can only stay for about 15 minutes to answer questions.

Many times in the past I had a similar situation and never had any issues with it. This semester the instructor who is teaching right after often arrives 20-15 minutes before her class starts and tells me immediately that I have to go with my students somewhere else. 

I make sure to leave the blackboard clean and take all my stuff away from the instructor's desk before she arrives, but I do believe that I have a right to stay in the classroom after my lecture for at least 5-10 minutes. There is no vacant classroom around, and I don't have time to go with students to my office, which is in a different building.

Last time the instructor told me in front of my students that I don't understand ""simple things"" and that I am ""playing games"". When I was talking to one of my students, she stood very close to us and clearly demonstrated that she wanted us out. I tried to explain her that I couldn't go anywhere else due to my time constraints, but she didn't want to listen to me. I really don't understand what ""simple"" things she meant and what ""games"" I am playing. 

We leave the board clean. She doesn't need to set up a projector. She can still talk to her students before her class starts, if she wants to (even though it seems like her students don't ask her any questions before their class). So, I don't see how I cause any disruption. 

I had met this woman many times before this semester, but we never talked. I didn't see her talking to other instructors/students much, and she seems to be quite reserved and a bit neurotic. She doesn't want to have any conversation with me regarding the issue.

I felt really offended after last class when she said those things to me in front of my students. What would you do in my case? 

Added later: There are no official rules regarding classroom occupancy between classes. Instructors are supposed to use common sense and be reasonable. For me using 50% of the break time seems reasonable to answer questions after lecture seems reasonable. I agree that for some people it may not.

I don't block the entrance to the classroom. A few students from the next class who come earlier always go ahead and take their seats as soon as my students start leaving the room. I also had one of the students from the next class listening to my explanation to one of those after-class questions and asking me further questions before their class (which is the same class as I am teaching, just a different section). Maybe the instructor got jealous, I don't know.

The entrance to the classroom is from its front (not back), so I do stay in the front. But it is a big lecture hall, and there is a plenty of space in front of the room (the board itself consists of 8 huge panels).

Also, during my career as a grad.student who is also teaching for the department, I have had several observations from experienced professors who are considered to be great teachers at the department and are in charge of undergraduate teaching policy. In my evaluations the fact that there are always several students approaching me with questions after class considered as very positive, meaning that students find me approachable. 

Thank you everyone for answers.

848,848,1350,Caucasus: end overland trip where I started without retracing my steps,"I'm looking into a Caucasus trip visiting Turkey, Georgia and Armenia. A return flight from IST is far cheaper than a multi-city flight, so I'd like to get back to Istanbul without going over the same route I came in (through Georgia, which as I understand seems to be the only way to get to Armenia from Turkey)

Given local neighbour relations, what path can I take that includes all three but doesn't repeat any part of the journey ?

To return from Armenia, I see two equally unreliable options: 


Getting an Azerbaijan transit visa and crossing Naxchivan, but the Armenia-Azerbaijan border is apparently closed, and I'm afraid an Armenian stamp in my passport could complicate this passage. The Armenia-Azerbaijan border is closed, so that settles this issue.
Getting an Iranian visa in Georgia then boarding the Tehran-Istanbul train. This is risky as Canadian-Iranian relations aren't super right now, I've heard of people being denied visas.

The only problem is how adventurous you are. Because there is only public transport across the major cross on the Black Sea.

I've crossed from Georgia to Turkey twice from Vale to Posof. It always feels like adventure. The first time I was hitchhiking solo and the second time I was hitchhiking with two Chileans I met in Tbilisi who had never hitched before. There were no other backpackers either time. The first Turkish town is not so close and there are no buses but I always got a ride pretty quickly because Turkish people are extremely hospitable and kind to travellers. This route continues on to Kars if that interests you. I got invited home by a local family for Iftar and to stay the night. They're even more hospitable during Ramadan! (-:

Just recently I learned that the border crossing at Kartsakhi is now open too so next time I would love to try entering Turkey that way.

If you're a bit hardcore but less hardcore than me you can ask around and probably hire taxis at the two remote border crossings, especially if you plan it in advance.

If you're a bit hardcore but less hardcore than me you can ask around and probably hire taxis at the two remote border crossings, especially if you plan it in advance.

5211,5211,8281,Shape of rotating rope (lasso problem?),"Let's take a wire or a rope. I usually do this with a chain or my scarf.

I fixate one end in my hand and apply rotation (by subtle movements of this endpoint like spinning a lasso). The rope gets into rotation and obtains certain bent shape:


Some part is missing because cellphone cameras ain't great for high-speed photos but I hope you can imagine all the scarf.

The question is: how can I calculate/predict this shape?

Although this problem doesn't seem that bizarre, I have never seen any solution. Nor I have found this question asked anywhere on internet... Must be because I just don't know how to formulate it without pictures.

Also by taking longer rope I get more than one bend:


I apoligize for the quality again. It is even harder to rotate this while taking picture. The form is not spiral, it is more like a shape in a plane that's rotating.

I'll be thankful for explanations, solutions, links or at least a correct formulation of this problem.

3421,3421,5445,Should you let users know if an email has been taken during registration validation?,"In many web applications, email is required to be a unique field, and users aren't allowed to register an account if their email already exists in the database.

When performing validation on the registration form, you would presumably check if an email has been taken, and let the user know if it has since they can either pick a different one or try to reset their password.

However, if you are providing this feedback, it seems like malicious users could test to see if users exist in the database.  Someone could plausibly test your site against leaked data from big-name hacks, and if the users are reusing their passwords across sites, then your site is potentially vulnerable.

The solution to this could be simply giving more generic feedback about what went wrong without specifically mentioning email, although that could be frustrating for the average user trying to sign up.  And if your sign up form simply requires an email and password, it is still pretty obvious that if any error is encountered it is likely that the email already exists in the database.

What is the best way from a security perspective to handle informing a user that an email has already been taken upon registration?
",IsThatQueeblo,https://security.stackexchange.com/users/68108,"An intuitive and simple solution is to make sure that an automated script (malicious script) cannot try to register with a list of e-mails in order to figure out which ones are registered.

In this way, even if few user e-mails are tried, a massive number cannot be checked. Note we are assuming strong CAPTCHA cannot be easily broken. 

But if it is super sensitive and you must hide who is registered at the target website even from human users, then finish the registration and do not show any error message to the user that the e-mail is already registered; and just inform the user at the end of the process that now they have to confirm the e-mail belongs to them, please go and check your e-mail; In the backend, if the e-mail is already registered, then do nothing; just send an e-mail to the owner of the e-mail and inform them: seems you tried to re-register at our service again, if you have forgotten you have an account with us, this is your username, and if you cannot remember your password, go to the password reset page.

4854,4854,7723,What magic items are there to capture or restrain someone?,"I'm looking for items to specifically address the strengths and weaknesses of the PC's.

For example, our wizard who has lots of teleport spells will be restrained with Dimensional Shackles.

Criteria for ""capturing"" a PC:


Effect doesn't end on a save

Restrained
Immobilized
Slowed
Cannot attack
Unconscious
Stunned
Dazed

You wont, as you have to explicitly shrink the database file to release space. Just deleting the records, SQL server wont release the space back to the OS.


  
  Since the database should not be this size. Is it still bad for me to shrink it?
  


It is generally a bad practice as databases should be presized properly. If you are 100% sure that your database is NOT going to be again this size, its OK for you to shrink the database (in your scenario).


  
  This is a production Database. If I shrink it will it cause downtime or lock the database?
  


Shrinking a database is a very IO intensive. Its advisable to shrink using DBCC SHRINKFILE during maintenance window or when there is minimal activity.


  
  In management studio you have two options, Database or Files. Given my situation what would be the best option?
  


You should use TSQL to do the shrink. (since you asked, shrinking FILE is the way to go instead of database). You can use shrink database in chunks - tsql script to do the shrink in chunks.

Remember that when you shrink, you are fragmenting your indexes.


  
  is there a rule on the percentage of free space a DB should have?
  


You can refer to Estimating Disk Space Requirements for Databases article. There is no fix rule, you have to take into account of how your database is expected to grow. You also have to take into account, autogrowth of your databases.

It is generally a bad practice as databases should be presized properly. If you are 100% sure that your database is NOT going to be again this size, its OK for you to shrink the database (in your scenario).


  
  This is a production Database. If I shrink it will it cause downtime or lock the database?
  


Shrinking a database is a very IO intensive. Its advisable to shrink using DBCC SHRINKFILE during maintenance window or when there is minimal activity.


  
  In management studio you have two options, Database or Files. Given my situation what would be the best option?
  


You should use TSQL to do the shrink. (since you asked, shrinking FILE is the way to go instead of database). You can use shrink database in chunks - tsql script to do the shrink in chunks.

Remember that when you shrink, you are fragmenting your indexes.


  
  is there a rule on the percentage of free space a DB should have?
  


You can refer to Estimating Disk Space Requirements for Databases article. There is no fix rule, you have to take into account of how your database is expected to grow. You also have to take into account, autogrowth of your databases.

1041,1041,1637,Where can I eat dishes that feature in western countries' Chinese restaurants?,"... apart from western countries like the Australia or the USA themselves.

During my visit to Taiwan, I wasn't able to find the dishes I'd typically encounter in a Chinese restaurant in Australia or the United States, such as sweet and sour pork, honey chicken, Mongolian lamb/beef, and fried ice cream.

I have two main theories on why this is. One is that Chinese restaurant food is totally made up, and has no similarity with food anywhere in the world. In which case, I'd better give up trying to find the right location. This seems to be the case with fried ice cream, which Wikipedia suggests is an artificial modern invention.

The other is that maybe I visited the wrong location. China is a big place, after all. Perhaps visiting another area, such as Inner Mongolia, would find me what I'm looking for, with dishes either the same as, or the un-modified version of what is served in western countries' Chinese restaurants.

The Wikipedia article on Chinese restaurant mentions:


  There has additionally been a consequential component of Chinese
  emigration of illegal origin, most notably Fuzhou people from Fujian
  Province and Wenzhounese from Zhejiang Province in Mainland China,
  specifically destined to work in Chinese restaurants in New York City,
  beginning in the 1980s.


As Fujian province is right next to Taiwan, and has had a major influence on it, it seems plausible that if some of the ""Chinese restaurant"" dishes were coming from Fujian, I would have seen them in Taiwan, but I didn't.

Where, if anywhere, can I find the dishes that feature in western countries' Chinese restaurants? Also, how should I identify the right kind of eatery in those countries?

3787,3787,6022,How to implement Many to many relationship for USERS TABLE in ruby on rails without using any extra table?,"I am a newbie to the Ruby on Rails but stuck at this interesting situation :

I have three Models with me :


User
Company
Project


I want to relate them in the following way :


Company has_many Users  
Users belong_to Company

Implemented via company_id column in USERS table

User.Company or Company.Users works fine.





Project has_and_belongs_to_many Users   
Users has_and_belongs_to_many Project

Implemented via has_and_belongs_to_many relation using in projetcs_users table

Project.Users or User.Projects works fine.




The real problem comes when I want them to join as following as well : 


Company belong_to Owners  (:through => User)
Owner has_one Company

---A company can have multiple owners but one user can own just one company. He can't be owner of multiple companies.

---A user may or may not be owner of a company but always belong to some company.
---A user cannot be part of two companies.
Project has_one Project_manager  (:through => User)
Project_manager belongs_to Projects

---A Project can have just one Project_manager but one can be project manager of multiple projects.


I am not able to figure out how the relationship should be defined in the Models. Also what should be the table structure for all three models.

My objective is to achieve :


Company.Owners

It can be done by : 

@owner = User.find(Company.owner_id) 
Project.Project_manager

It can be done by : 

@Project_manager = User.find(Project.project_manager_id)

We haven’t yet found MOSFETs having rated VGS>20V yet.

",Matt Mitchell,https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/71078,"We can make this work well for you.
But attention must be given to the changes required. 

You are trying to use the transistor in an unnecessary mode in order to attempt to eliminate a very common design requirement which simply needs to be faced.

ie you do not ""need"" a higher Vgs FEt - you just need to drive an otherwise suitable FET correctly by limiting Vgsmax to a voltage which is enough to drive the FET correctly worst case -but still less or much less than Vgs_absmax. 

In addition, you need to specify switching speed requirements and address them explicitly as part of your design. 

You ask (in a comment) ""If we are using the PMOS for fast switching applications (~10μs),..."" -> if you are using timings of the order of 10 uS (and you do not give any indication of switching speeds in your question) then the passive 30k R1 resistor is going to utterly mangle your switching waveforms. Without looking at the datasheet you can use a rule of thumb gate capacitance of 1 nF. That with 30k Rgs for turn off gives a time constant of 30 microseconds. Zener response times are far from your greatest problem.

Vgsmax of the MOSFET only needs to be safely greater than the maximum Vgs you need for full enhancement of the MOSFET under the worst case conditions of interest.
Very few MOSFETS need more than 12V Vgs to be driven as hard as is possible, so a Vgsmax rating of 20V is very acceptable.
By making R1 = R2 you reduce Vgsmax to about 12.5V. 

Looks at data sheet ...

VGs of 10V (actually -10V) is the maximum you need to fully drive the FET worst case.
Gate capacitance appears to be comfortable under 1 nF.
Better - use the gate charge curve at top right of page 6 to see what gate current you will need to remove the gate charge at the Vgs you wish to work at.
Note that they only specify Vgs up to 10V on this graph, and that gate charge is substantially higher at high Vgs levels.  

""At a guesstimate"", using 1k for R1 and R2 would probably achieve switching that is in the order of fast enough, and Vgsmax can probably be less than 10V allowing even smaller R1 - so lower RC time constant and less charge to remove as well.

It's not a marvellous GET - Rdson is 125 milliOhm typical at 10V Vgs, ~= 4A, 25 C. That mans you would get about 4 x 125 = 500 milliOhms Rds at 4A. That may be acceptable, but much better is possible at modest cost. 



To design this driver possible we need to know:

Maximum switched current.
Switch timing waveforms - on or off for how long?, what rise &amp; fall times needed and why?
What is the load? (resistive, inductive, heated filament, ...?)
Anything else important that will change the question when we know about it.



Note that FET gate voltages want to be kept well away from Vgs_abs_max. The gate to channel interface is an oxide layer whose thickness is measurable in ""atoms thick"" and can be broken down by a whiff of overvoltage if unprotected. Driving with say 10V abs max and then providing a say 12V or 15V reverse biased zener connected gate to source and physically close to the FET. With a load with any inductance, adding this zener  may transform reliability. This is because Millar coupling from Drain to gate can otherwise wreak overvoltage havoc on the gate oxide.

myJ2[n_] := 1/n* Total[RandomVariate[NormalDistribution[0, 1], n]^2]


This is basically an approximation to the gaussian integral. I want to plot this and the error graph (difference between the approximation and the exact value) at the same time. Using a random variable makes this difficult. I tried this:

DiscretePlot[{myJ2[n], 1 - myJ2[n]}, {n, 1, 1000}, Filling -&gt; None, Joined -&gt; True]


However, this is not quite correct, since the myJ2 function is called twice and hence gives different values due to the randomness. I improved this by using:

DiscretePlot[{x, 1 - x} /. x -&gt; myJ2[n], {n, 1, 1000}, Filling -&gt; None, Joined -&gt; True, PlotStyle -&gt; {Red, Blue}]

2459,2459,3922,Best practice for avoiding module / theme / profile name clashes?,"We currently have our code managed such that each site has its own theme and install profile. 
These have naturally evolved in such a way that the names of these items (and their directories) tend to be the same. 

For example, one site's theme and profile are both called 'dennis'

This causes problems with feature servers, and (I'm suspecting) with Aegir.

Now... it's relatively easy to rename either of these (although, for various reasons it's noticeably easier to rename the profile). Is there any sort of best practice here, ie is it normal to call the theme dennis_theme, or the profile dennis_profile? Should I apply this convention to both, or just to one?

200,200,321,Are there any disadvantages to encrypting the password hash?,"Is encrypting the password hash in database more secure than storing only the hash?

Suppose we store encrypted SHA-256 result with AES instead of hash directly. Is this a good protection from a situation in the future when someone will break one of the algorithms?
",Piotr Müller,https://security.stackexchange.com/users/61366,"First of all, every stored password should be hashed with a different pseudo-random salt.  Second, SHA-256 is not appropriate for storing passwords; instead, you want to use a key stretching algorithm, as has already been mentioned.  There is a lot more detail at Crackstation.

An encrypted hash is also called a keyed hash, and the key is sometimes called a ""pepper.""  There need not be a separate encryption step.  Instead, the secret key is part of the input to the hash function.  That can improve security somewhat.  There are two ways attackers can get a copy of your password hashes.  One is to compromise the storage mechanism, as with SQL injection.  In that case, a keyed hash can make it effectively impossible to retrieve plaintext passwords from the hashes because the key can be compiled in to a program or otherwise kept outside the password storage mechanism.  The other way is to compromise the OS itself.  In that case, the key is compromised, and is no longer an impediment against attempts to attack the passwords.

So, the short answer is yes, but you have to do the underlying work right, first.

1446,1446,2279,UIView should catch tap event but pass on moving events,"I have two views, one above another as a child.
View1--->View2 (View1 has View2 as a child)

How can I code this functionality?
1) if user TAPed on View2 - so the proper message tapped: sent to View2;
2) if user just moving finger over the View1(including View2) - events passed to View1 so it can handle touchesBegan: and so on. 

So what I am trying to code is make one function ""[View2 tapped:...]"" if touch was short, and another function([View1 touchesBegan:..] and so on) if touch is moving.

In my case if I move finger over View2 - it never passes events to View1.

P.s. I did not rewrite hitTest or anything.

249,249,402,Interacting with openCPU,"I've stumbled across an awesome open source project called openCPU.org and I'm tremendously excited about the project.  As a research scientist trying to create a website hosting my work, I would love nothing more than to be able to run R on the cloud to have my scripts run in real time and show up on my webpages.  So a big time thanks to Jeroen for making this project happen.

With that, onto my question.

How the heck do I interact with openCPU?

I can put an example function into ""run some code"" at:

http://public.opencpu.org/userapps/opencpu/opencpu.demo/runcode/

And retrieve a PNG image of my code, which is great!

But how do I do that in my own webpage, or via a URL?

I can get the object of my original code upload from this page, something like: ""x3ce3bf3e33""

If it is a function similar to:

myfun &lt;-function(){

x = seq(1,6.28)
y = cos(x)
p = plot(x,y)
print(p)
# also tried return(p)
}


Shouldn't I be able to call it via:

http://public.opencpu.org/R/tmp/x3ce3bf3e33/png

What about with input variables? e.g.:

myfun &lt;-function(foo){

x = seq(1,foo)
y = cos(x)
p = plot(x,y)
print(p)
}


I feel that perhaps there is something I am missing.  How do I specify ""GET"" or ""POST"" with the url?

EDIT

Ok in response to @Jeroen below, I need to use to use POST and GET with the API.  Now my question is extend to the following issue of getting PHP to interact with it correctly.  

Say I have the code:

&lt;?php

$foo = 'bar';
$options = array(
    'method' =&gt; 'POST',
    'foo' =&gt; $foo,
    );
$url = ""http://public.opencpu.org/R/tmp/x0188b9b9ce/save"";
$result = drupal_http_request($url,$options); // drupal function
?&gt;


How do I then access what is passed back in $result? I am looking to get a graph.  It looks like this:

{
    ""object"" : null,
    ""graphs"" : [
        ""x2acba9501a""
    ],
    ""files"" : {}
} 


The next step will be to GET the image, something along the lines of:

$newurl = ""http://public.opencpu.org/R/tmp/"".$result[""graph""].""/png"";
$image = drupal_http_request($newurl);
echo $image;


But I don't know how to access the individual elements of $result?

EDIT #2

Ok guys, I've gotten this to work, thanks to the answer below and to multiple other help sessions, and a lot of smashing my head against the monitor.

Here we go, done with cURL

&lt;?php

$ch = curl_init();
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_URL, 'http://public.opencpu.org/R/tmp/x0188b9b9ce/save');
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POST, 1); // Method is ""POST""
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, 1); // Returns the curl_exec string, rather than just Logical value
$result = curl_exec($ch);
curl_close($ch);
$new = json_decode($result,true); // $result is in 'json' format, decode it
$get = $new['graphs'][0]; // the 'hashkey for the image, ""x2acba9501a"" above

$img = 'http://public.opencpu.org/R/tmp/'.$get.'/png'; // link to the png image

echo &lt;&lt;&lt;END  // use this to display an image from the url
&lt;a href=""$img""&gt;
&lt;img src=""$img""&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
END

?&gt;

",Solar Nick,https://stackoverflow.com/users/1457857,"OpenCPU uses HTTP POST to execute functions, and HTTP GET to read/render objects and graphs. You could start with saving your function to the temporary store, and then calling it from there. A basic example is given in the ""/R/tmp API"" chapter of the interactive manual. If you click the red demo buttons named save a function, get the function and call the function it will work you through the steps. 

Basically in the first step you do a HTTP POST to the identity function to save your function in the store. This is also what is being done in the third form of the running code example page that you found. So I just copied your code there and then it returned me the object x0188b9b9ce.

To inspect if everything went OK, you can then read this object using HTTP GET. For example, open this url to read the source code of your function:

http://public.opencpu.org/R/tmp/x0188b9b9ce/ascii


Alternative outputs are for example to get the function as an RData file:

http://public.opencpu.org/R/tmp/x0188b9b9ce/rda


Important is that HTTP GET never executes functions. It just looks stuff up, and returns it in the output format that you requested. So now that you're convinced your function is there in the store we want to run it. To do this you need a HTTP POST again. For example to obtain a PDF, you can do

POST http://public.opencpu.org/R/tmp/x0188b9b9ce/pdf
POST http://public.opencpu.org/R/tmp/x0188b9b9ce/svg
POST http://public.opencpu.org/R/tmp/x0188b9b9ce/png


If the function you calling takes arguments, you include them as parameters to the HTTP POST request. When you want to include the output in your webpage, usually you only want to use HTTP POST in combination with the /save output type. So you would use jquery or whatever to do:

POST http://public.opencpu.org/R/tmp/x0188b9b9ce/save


Which might return something like this:

{
    ""object"" : null,
    ""graphs"" : [
        ""x2acba9501a""
    ],
    ""files"" : {}
}


This indicates that your function has been executed successfully, and it created a plot (yay!). The graphic was saved to the tmp store. So you can now obtain the graphic and embed it in your page using HTTP GET:

http://public.opencpu.org/R/tmp/x2acba9501a/png
http://public.opencpu.org/R/tmp/x2acba9501a/png?!width=900&amp;!height=500

2,2,2,Maximum protusion length for through-hole component pins,"I'm working on a PCB that has through-hole components on both sides of the board. The ""top"" side of the board is mounted flush to a Delrin plastic block (the only top-side component is a gas sensor that is fed air samples through hose fittings in the plastic block).

The flush mounting means that I have to add grooves to the plastic block to accommodate the soldered pins of the bottom-side components. Assuming a standard 0.062"" thickness FR4 board, how deep do I need to make the grooves in the plastic block? The only thing I could find is this NASA workmanship standard that states 0.5mm to 2.29mm, but I'm not sure if that will always hold true.
",Joe Baker,https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/10157,"Do you even need grooves?  We make several products using through-hole components that are intended to mount using VHB double-sided foam tape.  The boards are 0.062"" thick double-sided with PTH and we use a table-top vertical belt sander to bring the component leads almost flush with the solder mask.  In other words, the solder mask isn't touched by the sand paper but the leads are all sanded flat and sitting just proud of the solder mask.

This works well for small boards.

For what it's worth, there are commercial machines available that use a rotary saw blade to do the same thing.  The board is held horizontal in a mounting / clamping system on the base and the saw motor is vertical on a sliding X-Y mechanism.  The saw blade simply cuts all of the leads almost flush with the board surface.  

This system is suited for boards of all sizes but especially for those boards larger than can be handled easily to be sanded with the belt sander.

Also note that these techniques are suitable only for PC boards with plated-through holes.

369,369,582,Shape of rotating rope (lasso problem?),"Let's take a wire or a rope. I usually do this with a chain or my scarf.

I fixate one end in my hand and apply rotation (by subtle movements of this endpoint like spinning a lasso). The rope gets into rotation and obtains certain bent shape:


Some part is missing because cellphone cameras ain't great for high-speed photos but I hope you can imagine all the scarf.

The question is: how can I calculate/predict this shape?

Although this problem doesn't seem that bizarre, I have never seen any solution. Nor I have found this question asked anywhere on internet... Must be because I just don't know how to formulate it without pictures.

Also by taking longer rope I get more than one bend:


I apoligize for the quality again. It is even harder to rotate this while taking picture. The form is not spiral, it is more like a shape in a plane that's rotating.

I'll be thankful for explanations, solutions, links or at least a correct formulation of this problem.
",Džuris,https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/12727,"This is not a complete solution but I'm making it a community wiki so that others can supplement and correct it.

Frédéric Grosshans is almost correct in the above, but misses a crucial part of the problem: the rope may coil around the axis. The general method of assuming a stable equilibrium shape and minimising the (effective) potential energy in a rotating frame is a good one, but perhaps one should be wary of assuming that such a stable equilibrium even exists.

Pressing on, we parametrise the rope as $(z(l), r(l), \phi(l))$, and the potential energy is: $$U = \int_0^L dl \; \rho \left(\frac{1}{2} \omega^2 r^2 - g z\right)$$ where $\rho$ is the density per length (apparently irrelevant in the end, but we will keep it to make sure that the units are sane) and we take the convention that $z$ increases downwards.

The constraint is that each small element of the rope must be at a fixed length, so we introduce a Lagrange multiplier field (this is a field theory in 1D!): $$L = \rho \left(\frac{1}{2} \omega^2 r^2 - g z\right) + \frac{1}{2}T\left(r&#39;^2 + z&#39;^2 + r^2 \phi&#39;^2 - 1\right)$$ where $T$ is the Lagrange multiplier field (the name will become obvious, as will the random factor of 1/2).

Pushing through the Euler-Lagrange equations yields:
$$\begin{align*}
\rho g + (Tz&#39;)&#39; &amp;= 0 \\
\rho \omega^2 r + T r \phi&#39;^2 - (Tr&#39;)&#39; &amp;= 0 \\
(T r^2 \phi &#39;)&#39; &amp;= 0 \\
r&#39;^2 + z&#39;^2 + r^2 \phi&#39;^2 &amp;= 1
\end{align*}$$

The first equation encodes the meaning of $T$ as the tension in the rope. We may integrate it and obtain the quite obviously sensible $$Tz&#39; = \rho g (L - l)$$ (using the boundary condition that $T = 0$ at $l = L$) which simply encodes that the vertical component of the tension must balance the weight of the rope below. 

The remaining equations are 1st order in $z$ and 2nd order in $\phi$ and $r$. We have the coordinate setting equations that $z(0) = 0$ and $\phi(0) = 0$. There is a genuine extra parameter $r(0)$ which dictates the radius of the driving force at the top. However, one still needs another boundary condition for $r$ and $\phi$ (or possibly their derivatives) for the problem to be well posed. In addition, the condition for $T$ leads to a tricky integral equation, since the natural boundary condition is that $T(L) = 0$, and one would then need to integrate this to obtain the boundary at $l = 0$. 

Finally, I should mention that this partial solution as it stands has one serious deficiency which may or may not be connected to the boundary condition problem above: the equations are symmetric for $\omega \rightarrow - \omega$, so apparently an available solution would have the rope pointing forwards of the rotating force. But perhaps this is a maximum of the energy rather than the minimum.

In any case, the problem seems highly non-linear, and I would be surprised (and delighted) if an analytic solution is possible. One might hope however that there are easy to understand regimes (apart from the trivial ones at $\omega = 0$ or $\infty$).

Think of the perspective as your vanishing point from basic drawing. Bigger numbers create a more dramatic vanishing point angle. They'll give you a closer more epic impression. Lower numbers will more accurately represent the geometry of your original object.

The next most disturbing group of mistakes is false string interpretation, affecting Lisp and VB (and others).  Then, SQL also seems to be affected by false-negative comment matching.

So, the affected languages do not show up very often.  That in itself doesn't mean that no one in charge could notice.  However, let's look at the tags of the people making StackOverflow (scroll down to the ""Tags"" section on their user pages):


Joel Spolsky seems to be mainly into VB, C++, C#, and SQL.  
Jeff Atwood is a C# guy.  None of the affected languages appear in his tags.
Jarrod Dixon does ASP.NET and C#.  There is one occurrence of VB.NET.
Geoff Dalgas does C# and ASP.NET.
Brent Ozar seems to be mostly interested in databases with SQL.

1608,1608,2526,Hyper-V virtual machine can't be migrated to a specific host in the cluster,"I have a three-node Hyper-V cluster running on Windows Server 2008 R2 which is working quite flawlessly: there are no errors, live migration works, all hosts can and will happily run all virtual machines, and so on.

But one specific virtual machinee is trying to make me go mad: it works on two nodes of the cluster, but not on the third one.

Whenever I try to move the VM to that node, be it in a live migration or with the VM powered off, it always fails. In the event log of the host these events are logged:

Source: Hyper-V-VMMS
Event ID: 16300
Cannot load a virtual machine configuration: General access denied error (0x80070005) (Virtual machine ID &lt;GUID&gt;)

Event ID: 21102
'Virtual Machine Configuration &lt;VM&gt;' failed to register the virtual machine with the virtual machine management service.


All other VMs can be moved to/from the offending host, and the offending VM can be moved between the other two hosts. Also, this is not a storage problem, because there are other VMs in the same cluster volume, and the host has no troubles running them.

What's going on here?

When the SMTP server gets back online, the background service will pick up the requests to send the emails and process accordingly.

Question: I now have a requirement to deliver text messages with high certainty, but also to give feedback about a wrong phone number if that is possible. Should I have something like my mail queue to send text messages to my user phones or not?

I think it makes sense if we're talking about marketing messages, but what about text messages sent to users to verify their phone numbers?

What if their phone number is typed incorrectly? The phone API will tell me right away but if I put the request in the queue, I won't be able to let them know about it.

Rephrasing of the question: Should I care about the immediate feedback and loose the ability to deliver all SMS messages in case of temporary failure?
",Fabio Milheiro,https://programmers.stackexchange.com/users/1493,"Depending on the API for sending text messages, there are two possibilities for meeting those business requirements.


If there are separate API calls to verify a phone number and to send a text message, you can use a queue for the actual sending and verify the validity of the phone number just before you put the text message in the queue.
If there is only an API call to send a text message, which informs you about success/failure after the fact and where the failure codes are descriptive enough, you could send the message initially from the context of the user request.

4270,4270,6807,Why don't wifi managers remember mac addresses for hotspots to defeat the jasager attack?,"So I just learned about the jasager attack, via the wifi pineapple and it struck me immediately that it wouldn't work at all if network managers (privately) associated MAC addresses with hotspots and asked for explicit permission if you were going to connect to a new physical device.

Obviously this would be mildly irritating in public hotspots where devices change and hundreds of diverse locations share network names, but it would make home and work networks much harder to penetrate.

I haven't found any wifi managers that do this, or at least I haven't found information that any do.

My question: 


Am I missing something obvious? Would remembering MACs not actually increase security?
If it would, are there any network managers that do this? (I'm on Linux, but if there are tools for other OS's I think it's worth having them in the answers)

                Click=""Op_Click""/&gt;            
    &lt;/StackPanel&gt;


And this is my c# class:

public sealed partial class MainPage : Page
    {        
        public static readonly DependencyProperty RotationsProperty = DependencyProperty.Register(""Rotations"", typeof(double[]), typeof(MainPage),
            new PropertyMetadata(new double[3]));

        public double[] Rotations
        {
            get { return (double[])GetValue(RotationsProperty); }
            set { SetValue(RotationsProperty, value); }
        }

        private void Op_Click(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
        {
            Rotations[0] = 180;
            Rotations[1] = 130;
            Rotations[2] = 350;
        }

        public MainPage()
        {
            this.InitializeComponent();
            Rotations[0] = 20;
            Rotations[1] = 90;
            Rotations[2] = 180;
        }
    }


The binding works only the first time (at startup time). When I click on the button (changing the Rotations array) the binding doesn't work and it is completely ignored from my images. 

This is a very simple example, so it's clear that I miss something concerning the Binding issue.

this is a working approach that lets me specify the query of the sqlCommand

i wanted it to fit any entity and any model/object/table 

how could it be done ?

In the proposed HTML5 standard, there's the option of storing web application data in a local cache using a cache manifest. I am looking to use this technique for an offline tiled web map application and did a quick prototype here based on a standard install of Geoserver. 

I just ripped the OpenLayers client page that is generated from one of the default layers and changed the &lt;html&gt; tag to 

&lt;html xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" manifest=""cache.manifest""&gt;


And created the file cache.manifest which simply reads

CACHE MANIFEST

Which should, in my limited understanding of the matter, locally cache everything that loads from that URL: all tiles and the OpenLayers JS. In fact, upon first call in Firefox, it does ask me to allow local storage, but when I hit refresh - either online or offline - the page croaks stating that the OpenLayers object is not defined. Looks like it hasn't loaded the OpenLayers JS.

Using MEB with data on server with MacOS and Linux OS on the Target Server? One can only guess. Personally, if I had to port mysql data from one OS to another I would recommend this:


Run mysqldump from MacOS to sqldump.sql
Install mysql on Linux
Load sqldump.sql into Linux
Setup replication between servers

MacOS running mysql as Master
Linux running mysql as Slave



From here, just install MEB on the Linux Box (For free version, use XtraBackup) and run your MEB backups locally on the Linux.

89,89,148,How to fix a Macbook Pro trackpad where the mouse pointer is randomly moving?,"The trackpad on my Macbook Pro just started acting oddly. It's randomly clicking (which might cause me to switch programs), right-clicking and even once my screen even showed the swiping animation as if I was trying to switch to a different desktop.    

Part of me fears that this is some sort of joke hacking attempt (I know of a USB device you plug into someones computer and it randomly moves their mouse and types on their keyboard), but there is nothing plugged into my machine and I just turned off the Wi-Fi and watched as this web page tried to close, the mouse right clicked twice, highlighted a word and clicked ""Paste and Match Style"" in the Chrome right-click menu.
Also as I've been typing (with my Wi-Fi turned off) the mouse has randomly been clicking inside this question and changing where I am typing.  

I just plugged in a USB mouse which seems to work fine but the trackpad is now nearly useless. I can't even move the mouse cursor more than a few centimeters with it.

Is this a common issue?
EDIT
I think it is dying actually. I can now click but not move at all with the trackpad, while a regular mouse works fine.
EDIT 2
And now it seems to be working again. I turned on the option for ""Ignore Trackpad when Mouse is plugged in"" under Universal Access. I cleaned the trackpad with rubbing alcohol, I whined and complained for a few minutes to my dog, turned off the ""Ignore Trackpad"" setting, unplugged the USB mouse, and the Trackpad appears to be working mostly normally.
If I run my finger across it at the top or bottom portion of the mouse, it works, but there is a line horizontally across it (almost exactly where a physical trackpad button would end on the old trackpads) that is ""dead"".  The mouse stops moving, or moves sluggishly when hitting that spot and that ""spot"" goes across the whole trackpad.

I have had a similar problem a couple of years ago and I didn't have a special screwdriver (that I do have now) and I fixed a similar problem with a syringe with ethanol and squirted the ethanol in the crack around the touchpad.

I have seen many people suggest to change the touchpad, but you can try with a cloth and ethanol (remove the battery and charger if possible and wait for 30 min for the ethanol to evaporate).

How things should really work

There's a famous concept in programming called MVC, which stands for Model-View-Controller. The controller is irrelevant now, so I'll omit it, only discussing model and views:



There's always one model which represents the data or what needs to be persisted (stored). Then there are views - what the user see. Sometimes a user sees two views of the same data (think of a list of bars next to pins on a map), sometimes many users see each a view of the same model.

We assume that a user can edit the view, and the role of the MVC framework is ensure that once 1 view is updated all other views update as well.

With websites, there are quite a lot of layers between the model (which is stored and served by the server) and the view (which the user sees on their client browser), so it took us quite a few decades that get this update mechanism working on the web.

Early internet technology was based on the pull model - users had to perform an action, which would send a request to the server that holds the data and the server would respond with the data. So to get updates, users had to press or do something.

Nowadays, the need for a push model (the server pushes data the the clients, without them asking for it) is in high demand, and modern web technologies accommodate such need. One example is you may be looking at a question on this site, and suddenly get a notification that someone left a comment to one of your answers to another question - the notification just shows, even if you were just looking.

My point is, that with correct implementation using modern technology, whenever item X has changed, anyone watching it should be notified. One common problem in UX is that people got so used to dated technology that they take bad usability and how things work (or how things don't work) as a norm.

Should you show it to the users.

I honestly can't think of a single argument why not.

The most obvious reason to show it to users is that status of the system should be obvious to users. If something changes, and it doesn't reflect on the screen somehow, than the system status is no longer communicated to the user correctly.

Just consider someone spending 10 minutes to edit a form, only to get a message it was already deleted by the time they finish. It's a bit like the following phone conversation at the top of this post.

To summarise - you should always let the user know that the version they are looking at is no longer up-to-date. How you handle the various scenario (edited or deleted, for example) has to do with the business logic and the system in question.

To give one example, it happens sometimes that whilst you answer a question on this site, the original or the moderators delete it. Immediately you get a notification saying ""This post has been delete, no answers will be accepted"" and the ""Answer"" button becomes disabled. As no one has an idea what you'd like to do next, they keep you on the screen, but you can't do much on it other than going elsewhere.

Not all systems work that way. In many systems deleting an entity doesn't actually deletes it - it simply marks it as deleted and doesn't show anywhere; this open doors to alternative handling option.

As no one has an idea what you'd like to do next, they keep you on the screen, but you can't do much on it other than going elsewhere.

Not all systems work that way. In many systems deleting an entity doesn't actually deletes it - it simply marks it as deleted and doesn't show anywhere; this open doors to alternative handling option.

2821,2821,4490,Java ServiceLoader with multiple Classloaders,"What are the best practices for using ServiceLoader in an Environment with multiple ClassLoaders? The documentation recommends to create and save a single service instance at initialization:

private static ServiceLoader&lt;CodecSet&gt; codecSetLoader = ServiceLoader.load(CodecSet.class);


This would initialize the ServiceLoader using the current context classloader. Now suppose this snippet is contained in a class loaded using a shared classloader in a web container and multiple web applications want to define their own service implementations. These would not get picked up in the above code, it might even be possible that the loader gets initialized using the first webapps context classloader and provide the wrong implementation to other users.

Always creating a new ServiceLoader seems wasteful performance wise since it has to enumerate and parse service files each time. Edit: This can even be a big performance problem as shown in this answer regarding java's XPath implementation.

How do other libraries handle this? Do they cache the implementations per classloader, do they reparse their configuration everytime or do they simply ignore this problem and only work for one classloader?

1022,1022,1613,Lead Free Soldering and bad looking joints,"For years I've been soldering with normal Sn60Pb40 solder wire. But now I try to switch to lead free solder. In many forums over the internet I found the Amasan BF32-3 solder wire. It's a Sn95Ag4Cu solder wire with 3.5% flux. 

So I tried it and was very disappointed. Nearly every solder joint was looking different. Some of them were (partially) shiny; some (the most) of them were dull. And the worst thing was, that even with additional flux, the solder didn't flow like the leaded. So there is no way, I could solder fine pith SMD stuff with it.

I’m using a JBC soldering iron station with a C245-907 2.2mm chisel tip and tried different temperatures starting with 290°C to 360°C. The best results I get with about 315°C, with 350°C I got the worst results. I used the Amtech NC-559 Flux – the original, not the fake from china. 

Some other guys told me, that maybe the solder wire is not the best. That's why I'm looking for other soldering wires. But there are so many on market. Some with copper, some are Sn96.5Ag3.5 like the Amtech ASN96A3.5-0.50.

So can someone tell me, with what type of solder wire or what product I can get nice shiny solder joints. And yes, I now that dull joints were not a sign for a bad or even cold joint.

When I check out ""Links to your site"" in Webmaster Tools we have 11,387 links from Meetup.com. Is this harming us? After clicking through some of the links randomly I have discovered it is from one of our dealers that sells our products. He is sponsoring different groups and so the ad appears, the problem is he is linking back to our site and not his own. The anchor text is all the same it never changes. 
",Yamaha32088,https://webmasters.stackexchange.com/users/34786,"Your dealer may be doing a good job of promoting your product! You have to decide. I am assuming that he is making the exact same link (cut and paste) each time he sets up a meeting or makes a connection. If this is the case, he is very aggressive about selling. That may be good or that may be bad. That is up to you to decide.

Here is what I am assuming. On meetup.com there are 11,387 that all look exactly the same and of course, Google is concerned about unnatural linking. It is!

I am assuming that your dealer would be the only one to modify or remove the links. You will have to begin working with the dealer to remove these links. This is important enough that you may want to consider suspending their ability to sell your products while this is being fixed. Then I would do a manual review of the dealers practices. I am not saying that the dealer is a bad one. They may be, or just unaware of the consequences of linking the way they do. They have likely crossed over to spamming meetup.com. It may have been intentional, but I doubt it.

You will want to create or modify an existing page that defines these kinds of activity parameters that helps your dealers sell your product. I advise businesses in your situation to create a large variety of linking schemes, images, logos, and what not and make it a cut and paste option for re-sellers. You may also want to create varying marketing copy that they can use. Keep in mind that people tend to take just the top few of any choice you provide. This means that you will want to randomize your page so that selecting the top few will result in variety in the future.

You have to remove these links somehow. Work with your dealer to remove them. Remember that you attract more bees with honey! (Remember that bees are good, they fertilize crops.) Do what you can to be kind and gentle and assume the best intentions. But remove these links! Perhaps, the re-seller can provide log in details and your staff can help. Removing these links has to become priority one since it is effecting your ability to conduct business.

Being in accordance with, conforming to, or upholding the exact or primary meaning of a word or words.

Avoiding exaggeration, metaphor, or embellishment; factual; prosaic: a literal description; a literal mind.

",Mike,https://christianity.stackexchange.com/users/1743,"A literal interpretation is often in contrast to a symbolic or metaphoric interpretation.  A literal interpretation accepts the text as written to be historical and factual, while a metaphorical interpretation will often reject the historicity of a particular account and accept the moral or principle of the account.

This does not mean that literal interpretations force everything to be historical, like the parables of Jesus, but it accepts narrative as historical, poetry as poetry, and prophecy as prophecy.

When the Bible says God created Adam on the sixth day, a literal interpretation accepts that as historical and factual, while a metaphoric interpretation would likely see the whole creation account as unhistorical.

While you may only permit access to a specific service on your machine and so influence should be confined to a known quantity (such as serving a web page), there are no guarantees that there are no exploitable vulnerabilities in the application you are allowing to be accessed by external parties.   If a vulnerability exists and is exploited, the worst case is that someone else has control of your machine.  If they have control of your machine, then they can use it as a jumping point to probe other machines in your network for vulnerabilities.

This is why in corporate environments, efforts are made to ensure that any machine that will be directly accessed from the internet is segregated from the rest of the network via firewalls.  This can help limit the ability of an attacker to get further into the network.

So this is the risk you must accept, and help better define the risk, you would need to examine the history of the application being exposed - how frequently critical vulnerabilities are uncovered, and how quickly they are addressed.

Mitigation strategies you can employ are about reducing your exposure.  This can be done by only port-forwarding when you want to use the service, or closing the application when not needed.

4747,4747,7532,Another instructor is pushing me out of the classroom right after my class ends,"I am a graduate student in math in my final year, and for several years have been teaching at my department as a lecturer. This semester, in the same lecture hall there is another lecture that starts 20 minutes after my class ends. It's taught by another instructor from my department. I usually have many students coming to office hours and there are also students asking questions immediately after lecture. Due to other activities, I cannot have office hours right after the lecture this semester and can only stay for about 15 minutes to answer questions.

Many times in the past I had a similar situation and never had any issues with it. This semester the instructor who is teaching right after often arrives 20-15 minutes before her class starts and tells me immediately that I have to go with my students somewhere else. 

I make sure to leave the blackboard clean and take all my stuff away from the instructor's desk before she arrives, but I do believe that I have a right to stay in the classroom after my lecture for at least 5-10 minutes. There is no vacant classroom around, and I don't have time to go with students to my office, which is in a different building.

Last time the instructor told me in front of my students that I don't understand ""simple things"" and that I am ""playing games"". When I was talking to one of my students, she stood very close to us and clearly demonstrated that she wanted us out. I tried to explain her that I couldn't go anywhere else due to my time constraints, but she didn't want to listen to me. I really don't understand what ""simple"" things she meant and what ""games"" I am playing. 

We leave the board clean. She doesn't need to set up a projector. She can still talk to her students before her class starts, if she wants to (even though it seems like her students don't ask her any questions before their class). So, I don't see how I cause any disruption. 

I had met this woman many times before this semester, but we never talked. I didn't see her talking to other instructors/students much, and she seems to be quite reserved and a bit neurotic. She doesn't want to have any conversation with me regarding the issue.

I felt really offended after last class when she said those things to me in front of my students. What would you do in my case? 

Added later: There are no official rules regarding classroom occupancy between classes. Instructors are supposed to use common sense and be reasonable. For me using 50% of the break time seems reasonable to answer questions after lecture seems reasonable. I agree that for some people it may not.

I don't block the entrance to the classroom. A few students from the next class who come earlier always go ahead and take their seats as soon as my students start leaving the room. I also had one of the students from the next class listening to my explanation to one of those after-class questions and asking me further questions before their class (which is the same class as I am teaching, just a different section). Maybe the instructor got jealous, I don't know.

The entrance to the classroom is from its front (not back), so I do stay in the front. But it is a big lecture hall, and there is a plenty of space in front of the room (the board itself consists of 8 huge panels).

Also, during my career as a grad.student who is also teaching for the department, I have had several observations from experienced professors who are considered to be great teachers at the department and are in charge of undergraduate teaching policy. In my evaluations the fact that there are always several students approaching me with questions after class considered as very positive, meaning that students find me approachable. 

Thank you everyone for answers. 
",Lidd88,https://academia.stackexchange.com/users/31345,"You should first find out what is the standard convention for when you have to vacate the room.  Since the other instructor is in your department, you can take this up at the department level: talk to your advisor and/or a trusted faculty mentor about it.  

In my experience though this is often left a little fungible and people need to be reasonable about it.  In my opinion it is reasonable to expect to have access to the room five minutes before your class begins.  Ideally the previous instructor will have vacated the room at that point; if not, s/he should be occupying the room in a way which doesn't interfere with your own use of it.  (For instance, a lot of times students will not enter a room if an instructor is still writing on the blackboard.  It can be annoying to come to your class a few minutes before you want to start and find everyone waiting out in the hall.)

In the absence of a clear directive about how to split the time, it seems reasonable for the departing instructor to take half of the time, as long as they leave at least five minutes for the other instructor.  In your case 20 minutes is a very nice cushion (in my university it's 15 minutes), to the extent that I find it a little strange that the other instructor is arriving 15-20 minutes early.  What is she doing with that time?  Do more than a few students arrive that early?  If you are using the time to talk to your students and she's using the time for nothing, then I think you are morally in the right and should push back on it a bit.  You should be able to stay for the first half of the 20 minute break.

How should you do that?  As above, I would find out what other people do.  If the standard convention is that you can take those 10 minutes, then talk to the department head (or other departmental authority figure; e.g. whoever schedules the teaching) about it and get their support.  (You don't need to phrase it as a grievance or even identify the other instructor by name.)  Assuming you get backed, then you should pay a visit to the instructor in her office and explain that you looked into the matter, that you have a clear instructional purpose for how to use the time, and that the head (or whoever) has confirmed that this is a standard practice.  Definitely do this outside of the classroom so that you two can have the conversation you need to have not in front of the students and so that there is not a direct confrontation to be resolved.

In my opinion it is probably not worth trying to seek redress for your poor treatment by this instructor.  We are not obligated to be nice to each other; it's just better if we are.  If you respond to the treatment in a professional way and show that you are neither going to get pushed around nor retaliate in any personal or emotional way, then you're basically just rising above.  What some random person who you're only going to see for one more semester thinks of you isn't really so important, is it?  Especially if you're confident that you're in the right?

441,441,687,Can I use Ubuntu to diagnose hard drive or RAM problems in Windows?,"This may be a crazy question, but here goes...

My brother suggested that I could somehow use either a Ubuntu Live Boot CD or Flash drive or Kubuntu as a way to diagnose issues I'm currently having with my laptop. I'm running Windows 7 and for some reason my laptop has suddenly started freezing during Windows start up. This started immediately after I began seeing the hard drive light remaining on and my computer running very, very slowly - even though when I checked Task Manager it said that no applications or unusual processes were running at the time and CPU usage was 0%. Strange, I know.

I've used the Restore disks 3 times already, thinking maybe it was a virus, even though I run Norton 360 and it found nothing upon a full system scan. But every time I end up with Windows failing to start up at all, or it getting stuck on the ""Windows Starting"" screen for at least 15-20 minutes before it starts.

I'm at a total loss here. I'm thinking it is either a Hard drive issue or perhaps a RAM issue, but I am a total moron when it comes to the operational aspect of computers. I don't know where to begin. My brother said that if I used a flash drive of Ubuntu or Kubuntu and tried to boot from there that I would know immediately if it was my Hard drive because it wouldn't operate. I don't understand that since it wouldn't be operating off my hard drive, it would be running from the CD/flash drive.

Does anyone have any clues on what I can do to check this out? I'm tempted to buy a new hard drive and RAM, but would hate to buy something I can't return if they aren't the issue.

I'm stuck...any help would be very appreciated. Thanks so much and have a wonderful weekend.

From Storage Review:


  Rarely seen in a consumer SSD, Intel uses an array of capacitors to

From Intel:


  The Intel SSD 320 Series contains hardware- and firmware-based
  power-loss data protection features. The SSD includes a power-fail
  detection circuit, which  sends a signal to the ASIC controller in the
  SSD indicating there is an imminent drop in power level. Triggered
  by this, SSD firmware disconnects the input power from the SSD.
  
  The SSD then relies on its on-board power-loss protection capacitance
  to provide enough energy for  the SSD firmware to move data from the

3576,3576,5716,Why do different pain killers have different effects on people?,"I've noticed some pain killers working great for me, while others have no effect.

Works for me


Aspirin
APC &dagger;
Naproxen


Doesn't work for me


Paracetamol
Diclofenac
Tramadol


I doubt there is much of a placebo effect at work, since most of these either did or did not work when I first took them, without having expectations either way.

Whenever I have a head ache, I take an APC. I suspect it's actually the aspirin in there that does the job, since when I take just paracetamol, it doesn't do squat. As a kid I got children's aspirin, which worked.

I once had a severe back ache. I was prescribed diclofenac (a heavier variant than the over the counter one), which didn't work. I was then prescribed tramadol &mdash; same results. I then tried naproxen, which worked rightaway.

Why do some pain killers work while others don't?

Is there an underlying mechanism, that explains why some of these work while others don't? Does that predict if pain killers that I haven't used yet will work?

Please note that I'm not looking for medical advice on which pain killers to take; I'm just curious about how my body interacts with the various ones.



&dagger;: the one consisting of aspirin, paracetamol, and caffeine, not the one containing phenaticin. Think Excedrin.
",SQB,https://biology.stackexchange.com/users/6800,"Short answer: different people have different amount of active receptors. 
In treatment, combination scores of Pharmacodynamics and Pharmacokinetics determine the final effect of the drug. 
Receptors determine many effects of the drug in many pathways. 
Different people also sense pains differently (Psychology). 

Review answer

The purpose of treatment is to relieve pain and maintain function. 
Your question is biased. 
You cannot only concentrate on painkilling in maintaining health. 
These both are the reasons for the complains of the patient, not only the pain.

For instance, in rheumatoid arthritis, response to therapy can be quantitated using many measures including American College of Rheumatology system values ACR20, ACR50 and ACR70, which denotes the percentage of patients showing an improvement of 20%, 50% or 70% in a global assessment of signs (maintaining function) and symptoms (pains).

Each patient has own health, different from one another. 
Our body adapts to the environment and individual conditions of the body to maintain homeostasis. 
Receptors adapt for instance. 
They can be active or inactive - in short-run and long-run - again depending on the conditions at hand. 

Painkillers i.e. analgesics have different properties:


anti-inflammatory effect - acute and chronic conditions (inflammation is the major mechanism under many pathologies) e.g. nonsteiroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs, please, see this answer about the particular mechanisms and how different people have different effects from NSAID painkillers) and glucocorticoids (most) 
symptoms relieving specific drugs e.g. disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs)
anti-platelet effect - e.g. the older you get, the more platelets stick together.
anti-pyretic effect
...


which all can be toxic. 
Note that many drugs alone or/and as combination can work as painkillers i.e. pain relievers. 
Aspirin for instance has both anti-inflammatory and anti-platelet properties. 
However, it is rarely anymore used as anti-inflammatory. 
The anti-platelet property is dependent on the exact dosage of the administration. 
Aspirin's mechanism of action is to inhibit platelet COX which antiplatelet effect lasts 8-10 days (life of the platelet). 
In other tissues, synthesis of new COX replaces the inactivated enzyme so that ordinary doses have a duration of 6-12 hours. 
Please, review any Pharmacology -textbook for more info about aspirin.

Each these drug has own Pharmacodynamics and Pharmacokinetics


Pharmacodynamics answers to the question What drug does to the body? It stimulates some receptors, activates some pathways, ...
Pharmacokinetics - What does body do to the drug? It metabolises it (enzymes, receptors). It distributes it. It excretes it (kidneys, feaces).  


In treatment, you consider what is the target organ. 
You need to think what is causing the dysfunction and the pain. 
You try to restore the function and relieve pain. 
The component of drug needs to reach the target tissue e.g. your pancreas' beta cells do no produce insulin so your blood glucose is high. 
Complications of this are polyuria and eventually exodus if untreated. 
Insulin is injected into the fatty tissue. 
We do not have long-term acting insulin administered orally - our metabolism start to break the drug so it does not have wanted treatment. 
If insulin administered to the muscle, the time of action is too times less, again because muscle is metabolising the insulin i.e. a chain of peptides (protein).

No all symptoms and diseases have painkillers. 
For instance, prehemorrhoid and some types of itching related to  posthemorrhoids. 
However, for both, there are some special salvas for proplylaxis but they are not complete.

Now, you can start to read something in SuperBest's answer about host's physiological variables and addiction/tolerance which alters the mechanisms (receptors) of pathways in Pharmacodynamics and Pharmacokinetics.

In treatment, combination scores of Pharmacodynamics and Pharmacokinetics determine the final effect of the drug. 
Receptors determine many effects of the drug in many pathways. 
Different people also sense pains differently (Psychology). 

Review answer

The purpose of treatment is to relieve pain and maintain function. 
Your question is biased. 
You cannot only concentrate on painkilling in maintaining health. 
These both are the reasons for the complains of the patient, not only the pain.

For instance, in rheumatoid arthritis, response to therapy can be quantitated using many measures including American College of Rheumatology system values ACR20, ACR50 and ACR70, which denotes the percentage of patients showing an improvement of 20%, 50% or 70% in a global assessment of signs (maintaining function) and symptoms (pains).

Each patient has own health, different from one another. 
Our body adapts to the environment and individual conditions of the body to maintain homeostasis. 
Receptors adapt for instance. 
They can be active or inactive - in short-run and long-run - again depending on the conditions at hand. 

Painkillers i.e. analgesics have different properties:


anti-inflammatory effect - acute and chronic conditions (inflammation is the major mechanism under many pathologies) e.g. nonsteiroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs, please, see this answer about the particular mechanisms and how different people have different effects from NSAID painkillers) and glucocorticoids (most) 
symptoms relieving specific drugs e.g. disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs)
anti-platelet effect - e.g. the older you get, the more platelets stick together.
anti-pyretic effect
...


which all can be toxic. 
Note that many drugs alone or/and as combination can work as painkillers i.e. pain relievers. 
Aspirin for instance has both anti-inflammatory and anti-platelet properties. 
However, it is rarely anymore used as anti-inflammatory. 
The anti-platelet property is dependent on the exact dosage of the administration. 
Aspirin's mechanism of action is to inhibit platelet COX which antiplatelet effect lasts 8-10 days (life of the platelet). 
In other tissues, synthesis of new COX replaces the inactivated enzyme so that ordinary doses have a duration of 6-12 hours. 
Please, review any Pharmacology -textbook for more info about aspirin.

Each these drug has own Pharmacodynamics and Pharmacokinetics


Pharmacodynamics answers to the question What drug does to the body? It stimulates some receptors, activates some pathways, ...
Pharmacokinetics - What does body do to the drug? It metabolises it (enzymes, receptors). It distributes it. It excretes it (kidneys, feaces).  


In treatment, you consider what is the target organ. 
You need to think what is causing the dysfunction and the pain. 
You try to restore the function and relieve pain. 
The component of drug needs to reach the target tissue e.g. your pancreas' beta cells do no produce insulin so your blood glucose is high. 
Complications of this are polyuria and eventually exodus if untreated. 
Insulin is injected into the fatty tissue. 
We do not have long-term acting insulin administered orally - our metabolism start to break the drug so it does not have wanted treatment. 
If insulin administered to the muscle, the time of action is too times less, again because muscle is metabolising the insulin i.e. a chain of peptides (protein).

No all symptoms and diseases have painkillers. 
For instance, prehemorrhoid and some types of itching related to  posthemorrhoids.

1390,1390,2188,Migrate to new server 2008 file server but keep old server name (under domain AD),"i am moving to a new file server under Server 2008 Standard 32bit edition. I will refer to the older server as just ""server"", the new one i named as server2.

i have updated server2 and patched it. I have also joined the domain as member server and set up the raid structure. I have also moved the data over to the right spot. BUT here is what i am not 100% sure on.

The company wants to keep the old name of ""server"", i did not want to do that and was thinking of just making a cname alias in AD DNS forward lookup zone to point to the new ip address of server2 but you can reference it as server. In order to do the alias i would naturally remove or rename the old server or just unjoin it from the domain altogether.

I have read that you can just rename a computer to a previous name in AD as long as you have unjoined and removed it from the appropirate list under Active Directory? Can i just rename a server that is a member server in a domain? Do i have to change the sid or run newsid?

Just looking for some best practices.
thanks in advance.

This is a brand new WD black scorpion 500gb drive, on a brand new Zotac Zbox Nano CI320, quad core with 4gb of ram and Windows 8.1 x64.

Take a look at the pic and see from left are two USB 3.0 external drives and the last is my internal sata C drive that is showing issues. SMART scan came back A-ok! Kind of clueless here.



Update Back with some better news, after uninstalling the drive in device manager, booting into safemode then out again, I got this and confirmed it through about 4 more of the tests:
*note: the dip in data speed towards the end was from me doing something else with the drive while testing.


Update Tested again after 20 minutes since test above, it's back to slow 40mbps write speed :(
Testing on another system now! Then RMA if need be.

As it stands now: Sometimes getting full speed, mostly getting capped 40MBps write :(

Could someone please take a look at the SMART data and tell me if anything looks off to you?


Well guys, I think I've finally figured it out. It seems to have been a temp issue. I took some action to reduce temps, and attached two big solid copper blocks with thermal paste to the label side of the hdd. Temps now are going from 50c-60c variably. I'm probably going to make use of my eSata port on this thing, and relocate the internal drive to an external enclosure and eventually put in an SSD in the near future. :) My guess was the drive was going into a low power mode to reduce temps. That's the only thing I can think of.

If you're making light web apps with some logic, you probably don't need the more advanced math classes that many degrees require. If you're working with things that are a bit more processor heavy, than you're going to need more math. If you're doing work with any kind of scientific field, you'll really want to keep your calc references at hand.

Another place where you'll need math is if you want to write games. The second you want to move diagonally, you'll need to start doing some careful calculations so that you don't end up with characters that accelerate if the move to a block to the NE.

3928,3928,6265,Oracle.DataAccess.Client.BulkCopy - trying to cast varchar2 as number when it shouldn't,"I have a table (A)  that includes a column named confirmation_number.  It is defined as a varchar2(30) and contains something like SMITERI-2012-02-31-4567.

I have another table (B) that also includes a column named confirmation_number, and it is also a varchar2(30).

I have a stored procedure that extracts the data from A, performing some transformation on it, and it includes the confirmation number column.  

I use C# and ODP.Net to run the stored procedure and load a DataTable with it.  I then perform some additional transformations.  However, I never touch the confirmation number column.

Finally, I create an OracleBulkCopy object, set the column mappings, tell it to update Table B, and call loader.WriteToServer(dataTable).

I am getting the following error:

Input string was not in a correct format.
   at System.Number.StringToNumber(String str, NumberStyles options, NumberBuffer&amp; number, NumberFormatInfo info, Boolean parseDecimal)
   at System.Number.ParseInt64(String value, NumberStyles options, NumberFormatInfo numfmt)
   at Oracle.DataAccess.Client.OracleBulkCopy.PerformBulkCopy()


I have confirmed that the error occurs on the confirmation_number column, because if I don't load that column, the dataload succeeds.

Any ideas why the BulkCopy would be trying to turn a varchar(2) into a Number?

EDIT:
I have confirmed the following relevant issues:


This is happening on more than just the confirmation number.  This
appears to only be a problem on string columns - whether from a
string to a string or a string to an integer. 
This doesn't happen on every varchar2 column - last name and first name have no trouble.
This happens both on columns that have no null values (confirmation
number) and on columns that may have null values (street type).
Investigating the contents of the datatable at the moment before the
loader begins shows no difference in column definition between those
that successfully go in and those that do not.


I'm beginning to wonder if there's a bug in the BulkCopy itself and if I need to do this load using another utility.

This basic solution provides an effective way to dissuade customers from using this login page any longer by making it more apparent that there is another mechanism which should be used and provide them great messaging about your new and improved Site interface.

The idea is that the HTML fragment has some great messaging and then a bunch of line breaks to push the login control well off the bottom of the visible area of the page so that the user doesn't see it immediately.

I only try to have the node/entity callback url at hand to render entity or node content without any page.tpl.php or html.tpl.php involved, to use it somewhere else like for bootstrap modal, node_panels rendered into modals, or for custom scenarios to get most flexibility.

The reason that we simply multiply is that the results on successive tosses of the die are independent.  The die does not remember what results it has come up with in the past.

We can also get the result by using a counting argument. Imagine tossing a die $n$ times, and recording the results. So a record of $4$ tosses might read $4,5,4,1$.

There are $6^n$ possible records of the results of $n$ tosses, all equally likely.  There are $5^{n-1}$ records in which the first $n-1$ results are a non-$3$ and the last result is a $3$. So our probability is

2910,2910,4627,Should you let users know if an email has been taken during registration validation?,"In many web applications, email is required to be a unique field, and users aren't allowed to register an account if their email already exists in the database.

When performing validation on the registration form, you would presumably check if an email has been taken, and let the user know if it has since they can either pick a different one or try to reset their password.

However, if you are providing this feedback, it seems like malicious users could test to see if users exist in the database.  Someone could plausibly test your site against leaked data from big-name hacks, and if the users are reusing their passwords across sites, then your site is potentially vulnerable.

The solution to this could be simply giving more generic feedback about what went wrong without specifically mentioning email, although that could be frustrating for the average user trying to sign up.  And if your sign up form simply requires an email and password, it is still pretty obvious that if any error is encountered it is likely that the email already exists in the database.

What is the best way from a security perspective to handle informing a user that an email has already been taken upon registration?

1568,1568,2463,Why did Voldemort assume that no-one knew about Room of Hidden Things?,"Voldemort hid one of his Horcruxes inside Hogwarts. It seemed to be relying on security through obscurity as far as protecting it. But as we know, it ended up not being so secure because it wasn't so obscure - Harry Potter knew about the Room of Hidden Things.

My question is, the way Rowling describes this hints at the fact that Riddle had an assumption that very few people would ever stumble upon that room. *WHY???



First, let's show Harry's theory on what Voldemort was thinking, how and why:

Here's Harry understanding Voldemort's thinking in HP7 once he figured out where the Diadem was (bold emphasis mine):


  Tom Riddle, who confided in no one and operated alone, might have been arrogant
  enough to assume that he, and only he, had penetrated the deepest mysteries of
  Hogwarts Castle. Of course, Dumbledore and Flitwick, those model pupils, had never
  set foot in that particular place, but he, Harry, had strayed off the beaten track in his
  time at school – here at least was a secret area he and Voldemort knew, that
  Dumbledore had never discovered –


...and later on, with Harry explains the location to Ron/Hermione:


  “He hid it exactly where I had my old Potions book, where everyone’s been hiding stuff for centuries. He thought he was the only one to find it. Come on.”
  
  “And he never realized anyone could get in?” said Ron, his voice echoing in the silence.
  “He thought he was the only one,” said Harry.


.



Yet, from available evidence, that seems to be a completely wrong assumption, even at Voldemort's time. 

Let's examine that last quote again, with emphasis on other info available:


  “He hid it exactly where I had my old Potions book, where everyone’s been hiding stuff for centuries.” ...
  
  ...
  
  “And he never realized anyone could get in?” said Ron, his voice echoing in the silence.
  “He thought he was the only one,” said Harry. “Too bad for him I’ve had to hide stuff in
  my time... this way,” he added. “I think it’s down here... “ 
  
  They sped off up adjacent aisles; Harry could hear the others’ footsteps echoing through the towering piles of junk, of bottles, hats, crates, chairs, books, weapons, broomsticks, bats...


.

OK, so if there's a truckload (or train-load, by the description) of stuff in that room, isn't the only reasonable conclusion: ""the room is a fairly popular destination with plenty of people who've found their way there in the past, and therefore, likely, plenty who will in the future""? 

Doesn't matter what your arrogance level is, the evidence seems to point to only one conclusion - it's quite fine as a place to temporarily bury your dirt so teachers won't tag you for your misdeeds, but this is NOT the place to hide something that you want permanently safe! 

So why did Voldemort make such a moronic mistake?
",DVK-on-Ahch-To,https://scifi.stackexchange.com/users/976,"It is a pebble-on-the-beach approach - how many people are going to find the room, know that there is a diadem in there that is significant (and know what a diadem is, for that matter), be able to find it, and destroy it? Voldemort was relying on the anser being no-one, at least until such a time as he was powerful enough to not be bothered.

And remember that finding the Room of Requirement is not the same as finding the Room of Hidden Things. Finding the RoR is one challenge, but finding as the RoHT - reliably, so that you can come back to it - was a one in a million chance.

3361,3361,5363,Windows 7 batch search for email addresses,"Thanks in advance for your help. I have to do a task on my office computer which means I can't install any additional software, so I think a batch file might be the easiest way to do this even if it's not the most efficient (although I welcome other solutions that I might be able to do without installing software on my office computer). Also, please keep in mind that I have very little programming experience in your answers :)

Basically, I have a folder with a series of subfolders in it, each of these full of files of various types (text, emails, text-based pdfs, word docs). I also have a text file (or an excel column) with hundreds of email addresses in it. I want to use a batch file (or similar method) to run through each email address in the list and search against the contents of the various files in each folder like Windows Search does. Files which contain the search phrase should automatically be moved to a prespecified folder (possibly having to be renamed or put in a new subfolder as many of these files might have the same name). In the end, we should have one folder (as well as its subfolders) which contains no files which have any of the email addresses from the list in their contents, and another folder which only has files that has content containing the email addresses in their files (these can be in subfolders, or renamed, or whatever is most convenient, just not deleted).

(Since the list of email addresses is in Excel, another option I could entertain would be using some sort of VBA macro if that is capable of searching the contents of files within a folder recursively.)

I hope that this makes sense and I'm happy to clarify if it doesn't. Again, thanks for any help you can provide!

My first guess would be multithreading. For example, if you had your logic and render in the main loop, if logic takes a long time, you don't get anything rendered till it is done. With multiple threads, the render can be independant of the logic, and so evedn if the logic is bogged down, stuff still gets rendered, etc.

As per how to calculate it every 1/2 seconds, I am sure whatever libraries you are using contain the simple contraption of some sort of timing devices/timers, etc. Or, in the case the logic is threaded by itself, a sleep might also suffice.

The problem of ensuring the logic is completed by the time it must next be calculated might be tricky, depending on specifically what you are doing. You could: optimize the logic calculations, thread individual part of the logic (though I haven't actually used threads in a real application, so how to seperate but coordinate the logic, I don't know much on). Alternatively, perhaps you can either set a minimum calculation time (say 0.5 seconds) and give it as much time as it needs, or somehow otherwise coordinate the application to the time it takes.

I've been told the the proprietary drivers offer some extra protection from very short spikes (on power up and shutdown) in the current which laser diodes are very sensitive to and might be damaged from. But isn't the LM317 regulator taking care of that itself already?

949,949,1504,"Has Jesus ever directly said he would die as a voluntary sacrafice? If so, wasn't it double sense?","I know about mentioning Jesus died to redeem mankind in evangelical literature like:


  For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life. (John 3:16)


But I suspect these are only later interpretations. Has Jesus himself ever said his dead is a sacrifice?

If so, isn't double meaning in Greek? At least in Czech, English and German you could use the phrase ""he died for humans' sins"" in sense of ""because of"" - like cause of his death was humans' fault - fault of the Romans who crucified him.

(btw I think I understand the evangelical message so I'm not asking how christians get it today, so please don't make your interpretations of the direct Jesus' quote much distant)

Thank you.
",Probably,https://christianity.stackexchange.com/users/12541,"
  But I suspect these are only later interpretations. Has Jesus himself ever said his dead is a sacrifice?


Jesus's death is placed in the context of a Passover (Seder) meal, and since the meal is literally a liturgy, it must be completed or the participants defy the commandment of God. 

Anyway, Four cups must be drunk to complete the ceremony, and the Eucharistic cup Christ passed around at table was what the Jews call ""the cup of blessings,"" the third cup. However, any devote Jewish person would realize that the meal is then cut short, with Christ going to the Garden to pray while forgoing the fourth cup, meaning the meal was not completed. However, later on, in the Garden, Christ prays about ""letting this cup pass from me,"" which still indicates that Christ has the fourth cup in mind.

He is captured, and eventually sentenced, and again we hear ""Truly I tell you, I will not drink again from the fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God,"" another reference to the fourth cup. Notice how he refuses to drink the wine while he still hasn't suffered.

After his agonizing pain on the Cross, right before His death, Christ is given some sour wine, which He does drink ""And someone ran, filled a sponge with sour wine, put it on a stick, and gave it to him to drink (Mark 15)"" which St. John, an eyewitness, describes in more detail:


  A jar full of sour wine was standing there. So they put a sponge full of the wine on a branch of hyssop and held it to his mouth. When Jesus had received the wine, he said, “It is finished.” Then he bowed his head and gave up his spirit (John 19:29-30)


In all Gospel accounts, Jesus drank the wine and then died. That wine was the fourth cup which finished the Pasover meal.

And what do Jews call the fourth cup? The cup of Salvation, meaning that the Cruxifiction was a part of the Last Supper which ended in the cup of Salvation, bitter in more ways than one.

St. Mark and St. Matthew then go on to point out: ""And the curtain of the temple was torn in two, from top to bottom"" immediately after, which indicates that the relationship between God and Man was healed, He forgave Man, as forgiveness is the only way to continue a relationship. Thus, the Cruxifiction was for forgiveness.

In other words, all four Gospels teach that the Cruxifiction was for the forgiveness of sins. It is not a later interpretation (as if that is a bad thing anyway :shrug:).

Note:* I assume Markian priority in this article, although I disagree with it.

Note:** I also assume GJohn was written by an eyewitness. If you wish to believe otherwise (as the OP seems to implicitly believe), and instead see it as written by later Christians adding theological detail, that is fine. The point is that the Synoptics indicate the same events, although GJohn most clearly expresses the theological meaning, which are no less absent in the Synoptics, although they are not as clear. In a sense, one can see GJohn as a Gospel written to flush out more of the theological meanings of the other Gospels (which might be why GJohn is traditionally symbolized by an eagle, the bird that flies higher and sees farther than all other animals). Simply stated, the Synoptics, as well as the Old Testement, are the raw material which GJohn builds his theology.

5968,5968,9460,AES using derived keys / IVs. Does it introduce a weakness?,"I'm looking for an efficient way to encrypt multiple fields in a database with AES using a single global key, used throughout a large web application.

Obviously in order to re-use this key, a unique random IV is required for each field that is to be encrypted.

I'd rather not introduce more fields to the database to store each of these IVs, so the programatic approach seems to be to derive these IVs some how.

I'm toying with using either:

key = sha256(global_key + table_name)
iv = sha256(column_name + primary_key)


Or even simply:

key = global_key
iv = sha256(table_name + column_name + primary_key)


I'm leaning towards the former to generate per-table keys.

I've already read that the IVs do not need to be kept secret. So I'm working on the assumption that a derived key or IV (even if the algorithm becomes known), is no more insecure than any other non-secret IV, as long as the original key remains secret.

The question is:

Is there a fatal flaw in my approach? Am I introducing any serious weaknesses that, in the event that an adversary obtains a copy of the database, would make it easier for them to retrieve the plaintext data?

I realise that is potentially soliciting one word answers.

Suggestions for alternate / better schemes very much welcomed, as well as references to existing works and how they implement similar scenarios.

I found the TL783 high voltage adjustable regulator. But this can supply only 700mA output current.

I had forgot to tell the details.

Main purpose of this power supply is high precision sensor circuit.

Previously, when required 5V : Step down to 8v with a switching regulator first, then step down to 5v with linear regulator.
It is for the sake of stability of the power supply voltage.

When required 12V : Step down to 15V with a switching regulator first, then step down to 12V with linear regulator.

When required 24V : Step down to 27V with a switching regulator first, then step down to 24V with linear regulator.

This time required 75V and step down to 78v with a switching regulator first, then step down to 75V. I've tried...

1370,1370,2155,Idolatry in churches allowed?,"It is very frequent to see idols of Jesus or any biblical entities in  a Church , So is such idolatry allowed by  the bible,considering the following verses?


  ""You must not make for yourself an idol of any kind or an image of anything in the heavens or on the earth or in the sea"".
  Exodus 20:4


History tells us that:


  sometimes objects that God instructed to be made were turned into
  idols by the Israelites. The Book of Numbers contains a narrative in
  which God instructed Moses to make a bronze snake as part of
  addressing a plague of venomous snakes that had broken out among the
  Israelites as a punishment for sin. The bronze snake is mentioned
  again in 2 Kings 18; however, rather than remaining a memorial of
  God's providence, it became an idol that the people named and
  worshiped. Thus the bronze snake was destroyed in King Hezekiah's
  reforms.


More specifically in India I see Christians carry idols of Jesus and other biblical  entities with them kiss them and revere them too. Infact they allow the Hindus in the Church and let them perform worship in their way(Like putting incense sticks, offering flowers , foodstuff to the Idol of Jesus etc) as shown below a very common view in India. I studied in a Christian school for 10 years and i am yet to see Christians not doing these things.

I have seen the same on TV and in videos of people venerating the Idol of biblical entities.


",JesusBoughtIslam,https://christianity.stackexchange.com/users/3812,"You're operating under a misconception that these are idols. Most Christians don't worship these images, statues, etc. Instead, they are considered art, something that we  create because we love the subject, not the work of art.

Asking your question is like asking if looking at a painting of my wife means that I am allowed to cheat on her by devoting my affection to an image of her. I love her, not the painting of her. Christians love Jesus, not the statues of Him.

So, the answer id no, idolatry isn't allowed in Churches.  

Addressing the updates to the question, the things that people are ""venerating"" are likely ""Sacrementals"".


  Sacramentals are material objects, things or actions (sacramentalia) set apart or blessed by the Roman and Eastern Catholic
  Churches, the Eastern and Oriental Orthodox Churches, the Church of
  the East, the Anglican Churches, the Independent and Old Catholic
  Churches, and the Lutheran Churches to manifest the respect due to the
  sacraments, and so to excite good thoughts and to increase devotion,
  and through these movements of the heart to remit venial sin,
  according to the Council of Trent (Session XXII, 15).
  
  In Roman Catholicism, sacramentals such as Holy water, the crucifix or
  the Saint Benedict Medal are recommended as a means of protection
  against evil.


Again, the devotion is not to these things, but to the God they represent. There are, those that do worship them like idols, and many view the idea that these could protect us from evil as superstitious, the point remains that officially, these aren't idols. They aren't to be worshiped. They are reminders of the one we should be worshiping.

I tried Googling the answer to this question but failed to see usable numbers. This is most probably because it depends on the size of the holes and the type of metal being galvanized. So if anyone can give some numbers based on their experience, that would help a lot.

4719,4719,7487,Mechanical Equivalent of Heat,"Recently I have been looking up James Joule's experiment regarding the mechanical equivalent of heat.  After viewing some drawings of the apparatus, I assumed that the lines holding the weights would have to be attached to the drum.  They would then be allowed to fall completely through a certain distance until the lines were at full length and the mechanical motion of the fluid would have to be allowed to continue to flow, causing the weights to be pulled up a bit and drop again, oscillating up and down until the motion stopped and all of the mechanical energy from the weights would be transferred into the fluid.

However, upon watching some videos, (this video is about 14 minutes long; but, if you advance to about 5 min 30 sec, it will show the experiment in question.) I noticed that the weights were allowed to be stopped by a level surface (an external force) instead of doing what I have described above.  To me, this means the weights were still in motion and, therefore, still had KE that was not transferred into the fluid.  

Of course, the weights are moving very slowly, much more slowly than if they had been allowed to free-fall through the distance; so, their kinetic energy is very small compared to the potential energy they lost, meaning the vast majority of the potential energy was transferred into the fluid and into other, small energy losses.

Should I assume the speeds of the weights were small enough to ignore the KE in the weights?

The assumption seems to be that the potential energy lost by the falling weights was all transferred into the fluid.  However, in the experiments, the lines have to be wound back up and the weights dropped several times in order to make a measurable difference in temperature.  Each time the weights fall, they are stopped by an external force, meaning they have kinetic energy that is not transferred into the fluid after falling through a measured distance.  It seems to me that some of the potential energy from the weights is transferred into the fluid; but, some of it is transferred into the kinetic energy of the weights falling.

In the proposed HTML5 standard, there's the option of storing web application data in a local cache using a cache manifest. I am looking to use this technique for an offline tiled web map application and did a quick prototype here based on a standard install of Geoserver. 

I just ripped the OpenLayers client page that is generated from one of the default layers and changed the &lt;html&gt; tag to 

&lt;html xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" manifest=""cache.manifest""&gt;


And created the file cache.manifest which simply reads

CACHE MANIFEST
http://lima.schaaltreinen.nl:8080/


Which should, in my limited understanding of the matter, locally cache everything that loads from that URL: all tiles and the OpenLayers JS. In fact, upon first call in Firefox, it does ask me to allow local storage, but when I hit refresh - either online or offline - the page croaks stating that the OpenLayers object is not defined. Looks like it hasn't loaded the OpenLayers JS.

Why is this true?

My attempt:

We know that $$\lambda=\lim_{\rho \to \infty} \sup_{r \geq \rho} \frac{\log \log M(r)}{\log r}. $$

From the definition of the limit we have that for any $\varepsilon&gt;0$, there exists some $\rho_0&gt;0$, such that $$\left\lvert \sup_{r \geq \rho} \frac{\log \log M(r)}{\log r}-\lambda \right\rvert \leq \varepsilon ,$$ for every $\rho \geq \rho_0$. In other words $$\frac{\log \log M(r)}{\log r} \leq \lambda+\varepsilon $$ for every $r \geq \rho_0$. From here it is easy to see that $$M(r)\leq e^{r^{\lambda+\varepsilon}}, $$ for all $r \geq \rho_0$. I cannot see why $\lambda$ is the smallest number with this property.

You'll need to register your function:

$config = $em-&gt;getConfiguration();
$config-&gt;addCustomNumericFunction('INT', 'MyProject\Query\CastAsInteger');


Then you can use it:

SELECT e, INT(e.id) AS HIDDEN orderId FROM Namespace\Bla\MyEntity e ORDER BY orderId


PS: By adding the HIDDEN keyword, the alias orderId won't be in the results (and is only used for ordering).

568,568,892,How do I find wiper refills for my 2008 Nissan Frontier?,"I never had any trouble finding wiper blade refills for my 1998 Honda Accord or 2000 Toyota Echo.  They were inexpensive because all you bought was the rubber part of the blade.  The steel strips to reinforce them were retained from the original wipers.

When my 2008 Nissan Frontier passenger wiper blade edge separated from the rest of the wiper I started looking for a replacement.  Refills I found claiming to be for my Frontier were usually refills for an after-market replacement arm assembly and did not fit my stock wipers.  I did finally find a Trico refill for my passenger side (18-240, narrow profile) but their recommended driver's side refill (24-240) is the same profile but needs to be wider (9mm vs 7mm??)

Local auto parts stores all say they stopped carrying OEM refills.  I could get a new wiper arm but years ago when I did that I regretted the poor quality of the replacement and the way it never quite fit the window as well.

706,706,1116,Nikon D3000 Blurry Pictures. Focus Issue?,"Here are two examples:




Both pictures are in NEF format here.

The pictures have not been modified in any way except except for being resized and converted to PNG.

Just for kicks (and to prove I'm not crazy) I sharpened the butterfly image via ""unsharp mask."" It's not a pretty result but I just wanted to demonstrate ""sharp"" vs. ""blurred.""



Kind of annoying because I've ruined many epic shots with this odd focus problem.

My original Film SLR was a Minolta Dynax 505si Super 35mm (or in the same family, I think) and it performed marvellously. I used it for about 4 or 5 years all throughout high school and then (as an avid film photographer) begrudgingly made the switch over to digital in college. But the Minolta definitely gave me experience in photography and people genuinely enjoyed my photographs.

Early on, I don't know if I was just enamoured with the idea of vibrant digital images from an SLR or if I just didn't notice enough, but I don't remember a whole lot of images that came out blurry in the beginning. Maybe 60% of them (a liberal estimate). I accidentally deleted about a year's worth of early pictures so I'm unable to tell now.

The preview in the viewfinder doesn't appear to be blurry at all; then again, there's a huge different between the 3"" preview screen and my 20"" computer monitor.

Here are things I've tried:


Using a tripod (although, as you can tell, the issue is not a motion blur issue).
Tried different aperture settings (for example, the landscape image is f/22).
Tried different ISO.
Manual focus.
Auto focus.
Manually ""de-focusing"" the object (focusing behind it and focusing in front of it). Although, with the picture of the butterfly, this doesn't seem to be the case: it has varying depth of field and even the supposedly ""in-focus"" butterfly is out of focus.
Changing the ""sharpening"" property via the camera: Menu > Set Picture Control > (picture control -- e.g. ""Neutral"") > Sharpening
Went into a physical repair shop and they did test images. They didn't seem to find a problem, patted me on the head, and told me to be a good photographer and use the autofocus.
Letting someone else take the picture.
Chromatic aberration correction (typically through Digikam)
Different Lenses. The two below are using my AF-S Nikkor 18-55mm 1.3.5-5.6 G lens. I have a AF-S Nikkor 55-200mm 1.4-5.6G ED telephoto and get the same result (sometimes result is worse -- can post an example if needed).
And, oh, yeah, I even sent it into Nikon...three times. They said they fixed the problem. But, you know how those things go...


Oddly enough I've looked up reviews for my camera and both lenses and couldn't find many (if any) reviews stating blurry pictures for every picture.

A few thoughts:


Could whichever photo editing program I'm using be the cause of the blur? I used Linux so I've used Digikam (my favorite), F-Spot, and the Gimp.
Maybe it's normal for digital pictures to be blurry compared to film? Digital doesn't use crystals like film, so the opposite should seem true. I wonder this because a lot of work has gone into sharpening tools like unsharpen mask.


Sorry for the long post and various photo examples. Thanks in advance!

2688,2688,4289,How can adversarial game mechanics be added to a game?,"Some systems have the concept of an adversarial relationship between the game master and the players.

How could we change this to add hard game mechanics that would enforce fairness in encounter design? As an addenda, it would also be nice to see what games these mechanics come from and how easy they are to extract from the system they were built for.

We see that this is a ring homomorphism, as $$\phi(ab) = (ab + (XY)) = (a + (XY))(b + (XY)) = \phi(a)\phi(b).$$ So we have an injection of a field (not just an integral domain, and not just a homomorphism) into a commutative ring with zero divisors: $$(X + (XY))(Y + (XY)) = XY + (XY) = 0 + (XY) = (XY).$$
Like xyzzyx said in his answer, you can also find a surjective map from an integral domain to a commutative ring with zero divisors (eg. $\pi : \Bbb{Z}\twoheadrightarrow\Bbb{Z}/n\Bbb{Z}$, where $n$ is composite), so we can indeed find injective or surjective maps from an integral domain to a ring with zero divisors.

4770,4770,7572,Access PDF files from 'res/raw' or assets folder programmatically to parse with given methods,"Access PDF files from 'res/raw' or assets folder programmatically to parse with given methods

Explanation:

Right now this program accesses a file from a file manager that takes the selected files path and sets it to the 'mFilename' EditText field. The show PDF button listener below shows the String 'pdffilename' gets assigned the String contained in the 'mFilename' EditText field. The PdfViewerActivity is started and the String 'pdffilename' is passed as an Extra. In the onCreate() the intent is checked if null or not. This is where I think the change can/should be made. The String 'pdffilename' is assigned what you see below. What I want to do is store the PDF files in one of two ways... int the 'res/raw/example_folder/example.pdf' or in the assets folder. I want to assign 'pdffilename' programmatically with the path for where I am storing these PDF files. I have tried many different approaches all of which have either did not compile, caused errors, or caused a ""file: res/raw/example_folder/example.pdf does not exist!"".

So Basically...


I want to store PDF files in 'res/raw/folder_example/example.pdf' or the assets folder
I want to access these files from the code as in I do not need to use a file manager
Anyway that will solve this would be the biggest help, I am pretty good with Java, but I am by no means a superstar so please explain a little with your code

3805,3805,6048,Do delegates defy OOP,"I'm trying to understand OOP so I can write better OOP code and one thing which keeps coming up is this concept of a delegate (using .NET). I could have an object, which is totally self contained (encapsulated); it knows nothing of the outside world... but then I attach a delegate to it. 

In my head, this is still quite well separated as the delegate only knows what to reference, but this by itself means it has to know about something else outside it's world! That a method exists within another class!

Have I got myself it total muddle here, or is this a grey area, or is this actually down to interpretation (and if so, sorry as that will be off topic I'm sure). My question is, do delegates defy/muddy the OOP pattern?
",Dave,https://programmers.stackexchange.com/users/72130,"No. Encapsulation doesn't insist that an object ""not know anything about the outside world."" It generally says two things:


Other objects don't need to know how an objects does what it says it does.
All methods and attributes related only to serving a particular class are contained in that class.


The second point is often stated in various manners that can gives an impression that objects shouldn't rely on outside stuff; but this is a highly impractical understanding, if not an impossible one. Consider a really basic class:

class Document {
  public String Title;
  public String Body;
}


Even without any further definition, our Document class already knows about ""outside"" things: It knows about Strings! (String is an externally defined class.) And, ignoring the potential XSS issues for a moment, we might make a method that looks like this:

public String GetHtmlBlurb() {
  return ""&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;"" + Title.Substring(0, 60) + ""&lt;/b&gt; ""
    + body.Substring(0, 120) + ""&lt;/div&gt;"";
}


The Substring method doesn't exist in our Document definition either! It's an externally defined method in the String class! But, this is perfectly expected, acceptable, generally necessary OO code. With the exception of classes built exclusively around primitives (do primitives really even exist in .NET?), a class is defined in terms of other classes (external stuff, the outside world, etc.).

Regarding delegates, we could have similarly defined our Document to work with a variety of Body types we have no other information about. All we might require is some way of producing a substring wherein there are multiple ways of doing so (perhaps one version adds elipses in certain cases). All our Document cares about is the ability to call some method that claims to be a Subtring-like method.

class Document {
  public String Title;
  public Func&lt;Int32, Int32, String&gt; BodySubstring;

In brief: A delegate is just a reference to a method, rather than the full object we might otherwise include as a property. The difference is that our delegate doesn't require the object to be of a certain type: only that a particular method have a certain signature. Our class doesn't know what the object does and doesn't insist on knowing anything about it. So, in that respect, it actually knows less about ""the outside world.""

2554,2554,4066,How do I set up multiple printing defaults for one printer?,"I have a printer capable of printing high res photos on photo paper, and duplex documents on plain A4.

I have set the printer up twice (i.e. two separate printers pointing to the same URI) using the CUPS interface at http://localhost:631, once called Documents, once called Photos. For each of these instances I have set up the appropriate defaults (media type, size, print quality, duplex...). CUPS seems to remember these fine but applications (e.g. LibreOffice, EOG, firefox ... under Gnome Shell FWIW) seem to have some weird other default that bears no resemblance to either the defaults I set up, nor the last settings I used with any particular application.

It's a problem because there are so many settings to change that it adds a couple of minutes to each and every print job. Inevitably I forget one or two and end up having to reprint the job.

Seems there must be somewhere that these defaults get stored? Anyone shed any light on it?

4396,4396,6986,"D.C power supplies, regulated linear power supply question","Design giving the necessary ratings and characteristics the necessary for the transformer, bridge rectifier capacitor and regulator , a 12v , 2A regulated power supply .

the available mains supply is 230v+10% @50hz

so far I have : 

Regulator - Standard voltage regulator will require 2v to be maintained across it to prevent drop out , therefore input voltage should not drop below 14v 

Transformer - Va atleast  50% &amp; volt drop = 24v 

Capacitor - the minimum peak voltage to the regulator input 

(24-10%) x 1.414 - 2 = 28.8v

maximum peak voltage 

(24+10%+10%)x1.414-1.4 = 38.9v 

The minimum peak full hand voltage defines the minimum of ripple voltage 
(28.8-14) = 14.8

suitable reservoir capacitor ? 

I am uncertain if these figures are even correct , I think I am close but could do with some guidance 

thank you
",Chris,https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/77024,"As the comments to your question say, you need to find out a suitable capacitor value.  You can then see what the valley voltage of your ripple is, add in the voltage drop caused by the rectifier diodes, then arrive at the MINIMUM transformer secondary voltage.  You will then select the next highest available transformer secondary voltage, re-do all of the calculations, and finally find out how much heat that you need to get rid of.

Note that you need to design for the minimum available AC Mains voltage available when choosing the minimum secondary voltage.  You need to design for the MAXIMUM  AC Mains voltage when calculating how much heat will be generated.

Engineering is all about trade-offs.  If the available transformer secondary voltage is higher than you like, you can choose a smaller reservoir capacitor such that the worst-case ripple valley voltage is still above the regulator drop-out voltage.  This extra ripple translates into less heat wasted in the regulator.

Do note that you must NOT allow the ripple valley voltage to drop below the regulator drop-out voltage or the resulting regulated DC supply will have AC Mains ripple present in the output.  That can cause all manner of problems, especially in audio circuits.

Finally, pay attention to the ripple current rating of the reservoir capacitor when choosing a suitable part.  Note that the peak ripple current is substantially higher than the DC current output of the supply - the capacitor has to charge in only a small portion of the incoming AC sine-wave waveform.

2353,2353,3750,Call a chain of WebRequest.BeginGetResponse in sync'ed fashion,"I am writing a Portable Class Library to be shared by desktop and WP8. In the library there is a method to get data from a website, in which method a chain of web requests have to be made in synchronized way and in certain order, result from each response feeds the next request, only the final response is interesting to user.

I am a resident for tax purposes. Can I claim exemption under the India US Tax Treaty (21) ""Students and Business Apprentices From India""? So Do I have to file the 1040NR in spite for being a resident alien for tax purposes?

Could anyone site me IRS publications which clarifies this? I am looking through p519 and am lost :-/
",Lord Loh.,https://money.stackexchange.com/users/13083,"I was able to find several references that claim that the Indo-US treaty provision is limited to five years:

Here it says this (on page 20):


  Generally the treaty exemption for students is limited to the first
  five calendar years that the international student is in the U.S.
  However there is no set time limit for students from Belgium,
  Bulgaria, China, The Netherlands, and Pakistan.


However, I couldn't find any specific time limit neither in the treaty nor in the technical explanation. The explanation says:


  Thus, for example, an Indian resident who visits the United States as
  a student and becomes a U.S. resident according to the Code, other
  than by virtue of acquiring a green card, would continue to be exempt
  from U.S. tax in accordance with this Article so long as he is not a
  U.S. citizen and does not acquire immigrant status in the United
  States. The saving clause does apply to U.S. citizens and immigrants.


However, the treaty explicitly says this:


  The benefits of this Article shall extend only for such period of time
  as may be reasonable or customarily required to complete the education
  or training undertaken.


The reason for this last paragraph is to ensure that you don't artificially prolong your student status, and the 5 year limit may come out of the interpretation of this specific paragraph.

Similar paragraph exists in the US-China treaty, and the explanation for that treaty says this:


  These exemptions may be claimed only for the period reasonably
  necessary to complete the education or training. In some cases, the
  course of study or training may last less than year. For most
  undergraduate college or university degrees the appropriate period
  will be four years. For some advanced degrees, such as in medicine,
  the required period may be longer, e.g., seven years.


Based on this, it is my personal impression that if you're an undergraduate student and studying the same degree (and not, for example, finished your BA, and started your MS) - you are no longer eligible for the treaty benefit.

",Tamás,https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/users/482,"Riding with a larger tire in the front provides certain advantages. I do this for two reasons:

  If $A$ is an infinite set such that $A$ can be mapped onto $A\times 2$ then $|A\times 2|=|A|$


The problem is that we cannot necessarily choose from every fiber of $f$, so we cannot construct an injection from $A$ to $f^{-1}(A\times\lbrace 0\rbrace)$, which will prove the assertion.

While I'm on the topic, is it possible for a D-finite set to have such property? It is possible for a D-finite set to be surjected onto a larger set than itself, but what about that large?
",Asaf Karagila,https://mathoverflow.net/users/7206,"This is only a partial answer, but it's way too long to go in the comments.  I'll describe a permutation model (of ZF with atoms) that seems to give a counterexample $A$ for your statement.  It will be easy to see that $A$ maps onto $A\times2$, but I haven't proved that there's no bijection between $A$ and $A\times2$; all I can say is that it looks quite plausible.  If the example is correct, it will automatically transfer to ZF (without atoms) by the Jech-Sochor theorem.  So here's the model.

Start with a set $U$ of atoms in 1-1 correspondence with the product $2^\omega\times3$ of the Cantor set and the ordinal 3.  I'll write [x,i] for the atom that corresponds to the pair $(x,i)$, where $x\in2^\omega$ and $i\in3$.   Let $G$ be the group of those permutations of $U$ that leave the first component (in the Cantor set) of each atom unchanged.  So $G$ is the direct product of continuum-many copies of the symmetric group $S_3$.  To define the class of supports, let me first introduce the terminology ""thread"" for an $\omega$-sequence of atoms $[x_n,i_n]$ such that, for each $n$, $x_{n+1}$ is obtained from $x_n$ by deleting the first bit, i.e., $x_{n+1}(k)=x_n(k+1)$.  Let the supports be those subsets of $U$ that are covered by finitely many threads.  This choice of supports (along with the choice of $U$ and $G$) determines a permutation model $M$.

In $M$, let $A$ be the set of all the threads.  There is a surjection from $A$ to $A\times 2$, namely the map that sends any thread $T$ to the pair $(T',b)$ where $T'$ is obtained from $T$ by deleting its first term, say $[x_0,i_0]$, and $b=x_0(0)$.  (So $b$ is the one component in the real $x_0$ that is omitted when one forms $x_1$.)  This surjection is exactly 3 to 1, as it essentially just ""forgets"" the $i_0$ from $T$.  

I believe, but have not proved, that $M$ contains no injection from $A\times2$ into $A$.  The idea of the proof would be to assume there is such an injection, fix a finite number of threads that support it, and then look at what the injection could do with threads $T$ whose $x_0$ has no tail in common with anything from the support.

I further believe that the model would also work if I had used 2 instead of 3, but that the missing part of the proof will be easier with 3.  The point is that, with 2, each thread would support the ""complementary"" thread, consisting of the same reals $x_n$ but the other elements $i_n$ in 2. It would also support various ""mixtures"" of itself and the complementary thread.   With 3, a thread should support no threads other than itself and truncations of itself.

Going even further out on a limb, I also believe that the model would work if, instead of the whole Cantor space $2^\omega$, I used only the subspace consisting of the eventually periodic sequences of 0's and 1's and required threads also to be eventually periodic.  In this model, $A$ should be Dedekind-finite, thus answering the last part of your question.

4298,4298,6850,Idolatry in churches allowed?,"It is very frequent to see idols of Jesus or any biblical entities in  a Church , So is such idolatry allowed by  the bible,considering the following verses?


  ""You must not make for yourself an idol of any kind or an image of anything in the heavens or on the earth or in the sea"".
  Exodus 20:4


History tells us that:


  sometimes objects that God instructed to be made were turned into
  idols by the Israelites. The Book of Numbers contains a narrative in
  which God instructed Moses to make a bronze snake as part of
  addressing a plague of venomous snakes that had broken out among the
  Israelites as a punishment for sin. The bronze snake is mentioned
  again in 2 Kings 18; however, rather than remaining a memorial of
  God's providence, it became an idol that the people named and
  worshiped. Thus the bronze snake was destroyed in King Hezekiah's
  reforms.


More specifically in India I see Christians carry idols of Jesus and other biblical  entities with them kiss them and revere them too. Infact they allow the Hindus in the Church and let them perform worship in their way(Like putting incense sticks, offering flowers , foodstuff to the Idol of Jesus etc) as shown below a very common view in India. I studied in a Christian school for 10 years and i am yet to see Christians not doing these things.

I have seen the same on TV and in videos of people venerating the Idol of biblical entities.


",JesusBoughtIslam,https://christianity.stackexchange.com/users/3812,"It is right to warn people against the sin of idolatry when they are committing it.

Idolatry is forbidden in Bible in verses Ex. 20:4-5 and Ex.32:3. God forbad the worship of statues, but he did not forbid the religious use of statues.   

The use of objects for religious purpose is commanded by God as in Ex. 25:18-19:  


  Ex. 25:18 You are to make two cherubim of gold; you are to make them of hammered metal on the two ends of the atonement lid. 25:19 Make one cherub on one end and one cherub on the other end; from the atonement lid you are to make the cherubim on the two ends.   


Similar commands are also at 1Chr.28:18-19 and Ezekiel 41:17-18. In Num.21:8-9 God told Moses to make [a statue of] a fiery serpent, and set it on a pole; and everyone who is bitten, when he sees it, shall live.’ So Moses made a bronze serpent, and set it on a pole; and if serpent bit any man, he would look at the bronze serpent and live.  One had to look at the bronze statue of the serpent to be healed, which shows that statues could be used ritually, not merely as religious decorations.  

So God does not forbid the ritual use of religious images. the statues, paintings and other relics are mediums to recall the person or thing depicted and it helps to recall the life and examples of saints by looking at their pictures.   

All the three Abrahamic religions one way or the other use these mediums to strengthen their faith in one almighty God without breaking any of the command given by Him. As a corollary in other major  Abrahamic  religion i.e. Islam where it is strongly opposed to use of statues and pictures of Mohammed, it is an accepted practice to pray at Tombs of the saints (Pirs). Other acts like the use of pictures of religious shrines like Mecca and Rock of Dome is not at all considered as idolatry. Use of Moon and Star as a symbol of Islam and as also no:786 is very common in Islam. Even the veneration of printed verses from Koran is a common feature in Islamic faith. Many would also categorise the black stone in kaaba as the idol worship very much akin to Shiv lingam of Hinduism but it not taken as idol at all.  

It is when people begin to adore a statue or any of these mediums as god that the Lord becomes angry. Thus when people did start to worship the bronze serpent as a snake-god(whom they named “Nehushtan”), the righteous King Hezekiah had it destroyed (2Kings 18:4)

2660,2660,4233,call/cc implementation?,"I'm trying to find how call/cc is implemented. The best I've found is this Haskell snippet:

callCC f = Cont $ \k -&gt; runCont (f (\a -&gt; Cont $ \_ -&gt; k a)) k


Although this is not as simple as I want due to the Cont and runCont. I've also found descriptions of what it does, although never as clear as actual code.

So how is it implemented in its simplest form? I am tagging this with Scheme and Haskell as those are two languages I prefer.
",Pubby,https://stackoverflow.com/users/964135,"""Implementing call/cc"" doesn't really make sense at the layer you're working in; if you can implement call/cc in a language, that just means it has a built-in construct at least as powerful as call/cc. At the level of the language itself, call/cc is basically a primitive control flow operator, just like some form of branching must be.

Of course, you can implement a language with call/cc in a language without it; this is because it's at a lower level. You're translating the language's constructs in a specific manner, and you arrange this translation so that you can implement call/cc; i.e., generally, continuation-passing style (although for non-portable implementation in C, you can also just copy the stack directly; I'll cover continuation-passing style in more depth later). This does not really give any great insight into call/cc itself — the insight is into the model with which you make it possible. On top of that, call/cc is just a wrapper.

Now, Haskell does not expose a notion of a continuation; it would break referential transparency, and limit possible implementation strategies. Cont is implemented in Haskell, just like every other monad, and you can think of it as a model of a language with continuations using continuation-passing style, just like the list monad models nondeterminism.

Technically, that definition of callCC does type if you just remove the applications of Cont and runCont. But that won't help you understand how it works in the context of the Cont monad, so let's look at its definition instead. (This definition isn't the one used in the current Monad Transformer Library, because all of the monads in it are built on top of their transformer versions, but it matches the snippet's use of Cont (which only works with the older version), and simplifies things dramatically.)

newtype Cont r a = Cont { runCont :: (a -&gt; r) -&gt; r }


OK, so Cont r a is just (a -&gt; r) -&gt; r, and runCont lets us get this function out of a Cont r a value. Simple enough. But what does it mean?

Cont r a is a continuation-passing computation with final result r, and result a. What does final result mean? Well, let's write the type of runCont out more explicitly:

runCont :: Cont r a -&gt; (a -&gt; r) -&gt; r


So, as we can see, the ""final result"" is the value we get out of runCont at the end. Now, how can we build up computations with Cont? The monad instance is enlightening:

instance Monad (Cont r) where
  return a = Cont (\k -&gt; k a)
  m &gt;&gt;= f = Cont (\k -&gt; runCont m (\result -&gt; runCont (f result) k))


Well, okay, it's enlightening if you already know what it means. The key thing is that when you write Cont (\k -&gt; ...), k is the rest of the computation — it's expecting you to give it a value a, and will then give you the final result of the computation (of type r, remember) back, which you can then use as your own return value because your return type is r too. Whew! And when we run a Cont computation with runCont, we're simply specifying the final k — the ""top level"" of the computation that produces the final result.

What's this ""rest of the computation"" called? A continuation, because it's the continuation of the computation!

(&gt;&gt;=) is actually quite simple: we run the computation on the left, giving it our own rest-of-computation. This rest-of-computation just feeds the value into f, which produces its own computation. We run that computation, feeding it into the rest-of-computation that our combined action has been given. In this way, we can thread together computations in Cont:

computeFirst &gt;&gt;= \a -&gt;
computeSecond &gt;&gt;= \b -&gt;
return (a + b)


or, in the more familiar do notation:

do a &lt;- computeFirst
   b &lt;- computeSecond
   return (a + b)


We can then run these computations with runCont — most of the time, something like runCont foo id will work just fine, turning a foo with the same result and final result type into its result.

So far, so good. Now let's make things confusing.

wtf :: Cont String Int
wtf = Cont (\k -&gt; ""eek!"")

aargh :: Cont String Int
aargh = do
  a &lt;- return 1
  b &lt;- wtf
  c &lt;- return 2
  return (a + b + c)


What's going on here?! wtf is a Cont computation with final result String and result Int, but there's no Int in sight.

What happens when we run aargh, say with runCont aargh show — i.e., run the computation, and show its Int result as a String to produce the final result?

We get ""eek!"" back.

Remember how k is the ""rest of the computation""? What we've done in wtf is cunningly not call it, and instead supply our own final result — which then becomes, well, final!

This is just the first thing continuations can do. Something like Cont (\k -&gt; k 1 + k 2) runs the rest of the computation as if it returned 1, and again as if it returned 2, and adds the two final results together! Continuations basically allow expressing arbitrarily complex non-local control flow, making them as powerful as they are confusing. Indeed, continuations are so general that, in a sense, every monad is a special case of Cont. Indeed, you can think of (&gt;&gt;=) in general as using a kind of continuation-passing style:

(&gt;&gt;=) :: (Monad m) =&gt; m a -&gt; (a -&gt; m b) -&gt; m b


The second argument is a continuation taking the result of the first computation and returning the rest of the computation to be run.

But I still haven't answered the question: what's going on with that callCC? Well, it calls the function you give with the current continuation. But hang on a second, isn't that what we were doing with Cont already? Yes, but compare the types:

Cont   :: ((a -&gt; r)        -&gt; r)        -&gt; Cont r a
callCC :: ((a -&gt; Cont r b) -&gt; Cont r a) -&gt; Cont r a


Huh. You see, the problem with Cont is that we can't sequence actions from inside of the function we pass — we're just producing an r result in a pure manner. callCC lets the continuation be accessed, passed around, and just generally be messed around with from inside Cont computations. When we have

do a &lt;- callCC (\cc -&gt; ...)
   foo ...


You can imagine cc being a function we can call with any value inside the function to make that the return value of callCC (\cc -&gt; ...) computation itself. Or, of course, we could just return a value normally, but then calling callCC in the first place would be a little pointless :)

As for the mysterious b there, it's just because you can use cc foo to stand in for a computation of any type you want, since it escapes the normal control flow and, like I said, immediately uses that as the result of the entire callCC (\cc -&gt; ...). So since it never has to actually produce a value, it can get away with returning a value of any type it wants. Sneaky!

Which brings us to the actual implementation:

callCC f = Cont (\k -&gt; runCont (f (\a -&gt; Cont (\_ -&gt; k a))) k)


First, we get the entire rest of the computation, and call it k. But what's this f (\a -&gt; Cont (\_ -&gt; k a)) part about? Well, we know that f takes a value of type (a -&gt; Cont r b), and that's what the lambda is — a function that takes a value to use as the result of the callCC f, and returns a Cont computation that ignores its continuation and just returns that value through k — the ""rest of the computation"" from the perspective of callCC f. OK, so the result of that f call is another Cont computation, which we'll need to supply a continuation to in order to run. We just pass the same continuation again since, if everything goes normally, we want whatever the computation returns to be our return value and continue on normally. (Indeed, passing another value wouldn't make sense — it's ""call with current continuation"", not ""call with a continuation other than the one you're actually running me with"".)

All in all, I hope you found this as enlightening as it is long. Continuations are very powerful, but it can take a lot of time to get an intuition for how they work. I suggest playing around with Cont (which you'll have to call cont to get things working with the current mtl) and working out how you get the results you do to get a feel for the control flow.

The best I've found is this Haskell clip:,"""Implementing call/cc"" doesn't really make sense at the layer you're working in; if you can implement call/cc in a language, that just means it has a built-in construct at least as powerful as call/cc. At the level of the language itself, call/cc is basically a primitive control flow operator, just like some form of branching must be.

Of course, you can implement a language with call/cc in a language without it; this is because it's at a lower level. You're translating the language's constructs in a specific manner, and you arrange this translation so that you can implement call/cc; i.e., generally, continuation-passing style (although for non-portable implementation in C, you can also just copy the stack directly; I'll cover continuation-passing style in more depth later). This does not really give any great insight into call/cc itself — the insight is into the model with which you make it possible. On top of that, call/cc is just a wrapper.

Now, Haskell does not expose a notion of a continuation; it would break referential transparency, and limit possible implementation strategies. Cont is implemented in Haskell, just like every other monad, and you can think of it as a model of a language with continuations using continuation-passing style, just like the list monad models nondeterminism.

Technically, that definition of callCC does type if you just remove the applications of Cont and runCont. But that won't help you understand how it works in the context of the Cont monad, so let's look at its definition instead. (This definition isn't the one used in the current Monad Transformer Library, because all of the monads in it are built on top of their transformer versions, but it matches the snippet's use of Cont (which only works with the older version), and simplifies things dramatically.)

newtype Cont r a = Cont { runCont :: (a -&gt; r) -&gt; r }


OK, so Cont r a is just (a -&gt; r) -&gt; r, and runCont lets us get this function out of a Cont r a value. Simple enough. But what does it mean?

Cont r a is a continuation-passing computation with final result r, and result a. What does final result mean? Well, let's write the type of runCont out more explicitly:

runCont :: Cont r a -&gt; (a -&gt; r) -&gt; r


So, as we can see, the ""final result"" is the value we get out of runCont at the end. Now, how can we build up computations with Cont? The monad instance is enlightening:

instance Monad (Cont r) where
  return a = Cont (\k -&gt; k a)
  m &gt;&gt;= f = Cont (\k -&gt; runCont m (\result -&gt; runCont (f result) k))


Well, okay, it's enlightening if you already know what it means. The key thing is that when you write Cont (\k -&gt; ...), k is the rest of the computation — it's expecting you to give it a value a, and will then give you the final result of the computation (of type r, remember) back, which you can then use as your own return value because your return type is r too. Whew! And when we run a Cont computation with runCont, we're simply specifying the final k — the ""top level"" of the computation that produces the final result.

What's this ""rest of the computation"" called? A continuation, because it's the continuation of the computation!

(&gt;&gt;=) is actually quite simple: we run the computation on the left, giving it our own rest-of-computation. This rest-of-computation just feeds the value into f, which produces its own computation. We run that computation, feeding it into the rest-of-computation that our combined action has been given. In this way, we can thread together computations in Cont:

computeFirst &gt;&gt;= \a -&gt;
computeSecond &gt;&gt;= \b -&gt;
return (a + b)


or, in the more familiar do notation:

do a &lt;- computeFirst
   b &lt;- computeSecond
   return (a + b)


We can then run these computations with runCont — most of the time, something like runCont foo id will work just fine, turning a foo with the same result and final result type into its result.

So far, so good. Now let's make things confusing.

wtf :: Cont String Int
wtf = Cont (\k -&gt; ""eek!"")

aargh :: Cont String Int
aargh = do
  a &lt;- return 1
  b &lt;- wtf
  c &lt;- return 2
  return (a + b + c)


What's going on here?! wtf is a Cont computation with final result String and result Int, but there's no Int in sight.

What happens when we run aargh, say with runCont aargh show — i.e., run the computation, and show its Int result as a String to produce the final result?

We get ""eek!"" back.

Remember how k is the ""rest of the computation""? What we've done in wtf is cunningly not call it, and instead supply our own final result — which then becomes, well, final!

This is just the first thing continuations can do. Something like Cont (\k -&gt; k 1 + k 2) runs the rest of the computation as if it returned 1, and again as if it returned 2, and adds the two final results together! Continuations basically allow expressing arbitrarily complex non-local control flow, making them as powerful as they are confusing. Indeed, continuations are so general that, in a sense, every monad is a special case of Cont. Indeed, you can think of (&gt;&gt;=) in general as using a kind of continuation-passing style:

(&gt;&gt;=) :: (Monad m) =&gt; m a -&gt; (a -&gt; m b) -&gt; m b


The second argument is a continuation taking the result of the first computation and returning the rest of the computation to be run.

But I still haven't answered the question: what's going on with that callCC? Well, it calls the function you give with the current continuation. But hang on a second, isn't that what we were doing with Cont already? Yes, but compare the types:

Cont   :: ((a -&gt; r)        -&gt; r)        -&gt; Cont r a
callCC :: ((a -&gt; Cont r b) -&gt; Cont r a) -&gt; Cont r a


Huh. You see, the problem with Cont is that we can't sequence actions from inside of the function we pass — we're just producing an r result in a pure manner. callCC lets the continuation be accessed, passed around, and just generally be messed around with from inside Cont computations. When we have

do a &lt;- callCC (\cc -&gt; ...)
   foo ...


You can imagine cc being a function we can call with any value inside the function to make that the return value of callCC (\cc -&gt; ...) computation itself. Or, of course, we could just return a value normally, but then calling callCC in the first place would be a little pointless :)

As for the mysterious b there, it's just because you can use cc foo to stand in for a computation of any type you want, since it escapes the normal control flow and, like I said, immediately uses that as the result of the entire callCC (\cc -&gt; ...). So since it never has to actually produce a value, it can get away with returning a value of any type it wants. Sneaky!

Which brings us to the actual implementation:

callCC f = Cont (\k -&gt; runCont (f (\a -&gt; Cont (\_ -&gt; k a))) k)


First, we get the entire rest of the computation, and call it k. But what's this f (\a -&gt; Cont (\_ -&gt; k a)) part about? Well, we know that f takes a value of type (a -&gt; Cont r b), and that's what the lambda is — a function that takes a value to use as the result of the callCC f, and returns a Cont computation that ignores its continuation and just returns that value through k — the ""rest of the computation"" from the perspective of callCC f. OK, so the result of that f call is another Cont computation, which we'll need to supply a continuation to in order to run.

1789,1789,2841,Hibernate does not allow an embedded object with an int field to be null?,"Hibernate does not allow me to persist an object that contains an null embedded object with an integer field.  For example, if I have a class called Thing that looks like this

@Entity
public class Thing {

    @Id
    public String id;

    public Part part;

}


where Part is an embeddable class that looks like this

@Embeddable
public class Part {

    public String a;    

    public int b;

}


then trying to persist a Thing object with a null Part causes Hibernate to throw an Exception.  In particular, this code

Thing th = new Thing();
th.id = ""thing.1"";
th.part = null;
session.saveOrUpdate(th);


causes Hibernate to throw this Exception

org.hibernate.PropertyValueException: not-null property references a null or transient value: com.ace.moab.api.jobs.Thing.part


My guess is that this is happening because Part is an embedded class and so Part.a and Part.b are simply columns in the Thing database table.   Since the Thing.part is null Hibernate wants to set the Part.a and Part.b column values to null for the row for thing.1.  However, Part.b is an integer and Hibernate will not allow integer columns in the database to be null.  This is what causes the Exception, right?

So I am looking for workarounds for this problem.  I noticed making Part.b an Integer instead of an int seems to work, but for reasons I won't bore you with this is not a good option for us.  Thanks!

This works for us because our hibernate enabled application is the only thing that touched the database and so we can guarantee that b is null only when the part is null.

4915,4915,7826,How should hands that are EXTREMELY strong in one suit (10+ cards) be bid?,"I'm a bit of a bridge noob, but I'm kind of puzzled about this. Say I have a hand that is ridiculously strong in one suit, say at least 10 cards with all 4 honors (I'll use spades for the example suit). how should I bid? This is so many cards that almost nobody will be leading spades but me, so if another suit is trump, I'm flush out of luck.

Obviously I would want to end up playing a spade contract with a good potential for a slam, but if I open too high, say 5 spades, won't my opponents catch on pretty quickly and bid in their own suits or No-trump, just so my spades will be next to useless? They will likely have favorable distributions for their own suits since nearly all the spades are gone, which only worsens the fact. Then again, if I bid to low, my partner may not rebid, and while taking 12 tricks at a contract of 3S is obviously good, knowing you will have that many overtricks from the start seems kind of a waste.

Even if I held 12 or 13 spades, if I bid 7S, won't my opponents just bid 7NT and I'll never get to lead? How should hands with this heavy a distribution be bid to make the most of them?

(I've already said I'm not a very experienced bridge player, so if I'm making any glaring oversights don't hesitate in the slightest to bring them up.)



NOTE: I know these hands are extremely rare, but in all reality, every single possible hand is rare enough that studying bridge hands is actually quite useless because you'll never see the same hand again in your life...but we do it anyway because that's how we learn. Couldn't you tell anyone asking about a specific hand not to worry about it because it'll never show up again? :D
",Gordon Gustafson,https://boardgames.stackexchange.com/users/191,"If you have 10+ spades in your hand, you will never let a contract die out in 3S now, would you?

It really depends on the hand, but people play the following two conventions which might potentially be useful (of course, there might be others).


Namyats. This is to distinguish hands which are too strong for just preempting 4S. You show stronger hands by bidding 4D (taking spades as your suit), which you could potentially use here, though 10+ would probably be too strong. There are various followups which can be used to investigate slam.
4NT opening bid as Ace asking. Say you had AKQJxxxxxx, A,x,x. You could bid 4NT as asking for Aces, and bid the slam appropriately.


Anyway, hands with a 10+ suit are very rare and even experts have trouble with them (or rather, don't bother with them so much, because of the rarity).

As to your question about opponents taking out to their suit, why do you think that is likely to happen? It is quite risky for them to be bidding at the 5/6/7 level, without a running suit of their own. Your bidding at the 4/5/6/7 level would have taken out enough bidding space to make it unlikely they would be able to overcall easily (and find a fit). You seem to be also forgetting that you have a partner who could still hold some cards, and could easily double them and take them for a number. If they do bid, well, you can't help it, but I would say it is not as likely as you seem to think.



As to your edit.

Yes, any specific hand (down to the spots) is a low occurrence (in fact same chance for each hand!), but bidding systems are not geared towards finding the exact specific hand you have. Bidding systems are geared towards finding fits, distribution and strength with the ultimate goal of finding the right strain and level based on the scoring.

When talking about 'rarity', you should be thinking in terms of hand types rather than specific hands. So when someone says getting a 7 card spade suit is much more likely than getting a 10 card spade suit, they are not talking specific hands, but a set of hands. Take the set of all hands which have 7 card spade suit and the set of all hands which have a 10 card spade suit and compare the counts. 

When people say 10+ card suits are rare, they are talking about the whole set. 

You might never get the same hand dealt again, true, but the same hand type (say 15-17 balanced) might occur again frequently.

Bidding space is very limited, and trying to cater to rare hands can be inefficient use of that space.

4731,4731,7505,Will a spellcaster interrupted mid-meditation or -study have any spells?,"I've noticed that Wizards, Clerics, Druids, and most other spell-casting classes (With the exception of Sorcerers) spend at least 1 hour Studying or Meditating to regain their spells.

What I want to know is that if I (As the GM) used an encounter to interrupt the preparation time of the party halfway through, will the party have any spells available to utilise?  If they do, is there any RAW method to restrict which spells they will have? (Such as no spells requiring an attack roll, or spells that deal damage.)

Is there anything I can do to force a Sorcerer or other spontaneous caster to contend with the same issue?

Backstory:

I want to introduce a recurring villain, who will be involved as a plot device for quite a while before eventually transforming into a BBEG.  Said villain will have quite high DR-which will prevent melee characters from being able to kill him, but looking for a method to surprise the casters, forcing them to look for alternate methods to escape. (Particular villain has yet to be decided, but I don't think it would help the answer at all.)

I'm not looking to kill the PCs, at all.  Just want a way to scare them a bit, making them think about what they are actually doing.

I have considered an anti-magic field already, but I think this would lead the party to kiting, rather then looking outside the box.
",Nyoze,https://rpg.stackexchange.com/users/23186,"Officially, interrupting the 1-hour of meditation or study results in no spells prepared...

Each of the classes you mention has no provision for partial preparation of spells.


""Each cleric must choose a time when she must spend 1 hour each day in quiet contemplation or supplication to regain her daily allotment of spells.""
""A druid must spend 1 hour each day in a trance-like meditation on the mysteries of nature to regain her daily allotment of spells.""
""[A wizard]  must choose and prepare his spells ahead of time by getting 8 hours of sleep and spending 1 hour studying his spellbook.""


Using a strict reading of the rules as they are written, that's exactly how long preparing all of the appropriate caster's spells takes, and stopping early means no prepared spells. Yes, the day after the massive battle that exhausted all his spells, even Count Slimeheart, Archmage of the Drooling Tower, if interrupted 1 min. before finishing his hour of study, will find himself with no spells prepared.

But, as per Preparing Wizard Spells, a wizard


  [p]reparing some smaller portion of his daily capacity takes a proportionally smaller amount of time, but always at least 15 minutes, the minimum time required to achieve the proper mental state.


Thus, a wizard can choose beforehand after resting to prepare a fraction of his spells, yet it's up to the DM if the wizard who planned to spend an hour preparing but actually spent less time preparing has prepared some of his spells or none at all.

Likewise, as per Preparing Divine Spells, divine spell casters who prepare spells must meditate for at least 15 min. at their appointed or chosen time, but can also leave spell slots unfilled for filling later, taking 15 min. per quarter of spells.

(A clever wizard or divine caster of prepared spells may start preparing 25% of his spells in 15-min. bursts instead of 1-hour long stretches, or the DM can just assume every experienced caster does this. I'm going to go out on a limb and say that this isn't the default method of spell preparation because the default method of 1 hour and get 'em all makes bookkeeping easier and arguments fewer.)

...And sorcerers need only 15 min. to concentrate...

Although sorcerers lack many problems their more devout and studious compatriots possess...


  Unlike a wizard or a cleric, a sorcerer need not prepare her spells in advance. She can cast any spell she knows at any time, assuming she has not yet used up her spells per day for that spell level.


...the section Magic under Sorcerers and Bards says


  Each day, sorcerers and bards must focus their minds on the task of casting their spells. A sorcerer or bard needs 8 hours of rest (just like a wizard), after which she spends 15 minutes concentrating. (A bard must sing, recite, or play an instrument of some kind while concentrating.) During this period, the sorcerer or bard readies her mind to cast her daily allotment of spells. Without such a period to refresh herself, the character does not regain the spell slots she used up the day before.


So there's a 15 min. window during which a sorcerer still hasn't regained yesterday's used spell slots upon awakening from 8 hours rest, but then the sorcerer's ready to go. (Of course, there's also the 50/50 chance he's 1 entire spell level below other full casters, but that's beside the point.)

...So the the GM could make a house rule that such concentration takes longer than 15 min.

If made at the campaign's beginning, a house rule mandating that the sorcerer (and similar casters like the bard) must spend, instead, an hour concentrating upon awakening from 8 hours rest is reasonable. Although such characters often have hard enough lives, such characters are also usually full casters, so it's not as damaging a house rule as, for example, a house rule that somehow nerfs melee attacks. It's a burden, certainly, but it's not an excessive burden so far as house rules go.

However, a GM who makes such a house rule mid-campaign then attacks the party of sorcerers 16 min. into their preparation time is really just asking his players to leave.



An Aside: Please don't attack PCs while they're preparing spells. If you do, they'll try to do the same to the bad guys. You don't want to spend a whole afternoon making a wizard baddie only to have the baddie dead before his turn because the PCs interrupted him while he was studying, so don't do that to the PCs your players have been tinkering with for months either.

If you're afraid of the PCs downing the big bad evil guy early, don't use him! Send instead paid assassins, bound or allied creatures, created minions, simulacra, projected images, or fanatics. Have the baddie mail threatening letters containing a magic mouth or explosive runes. While the PCs aren't around, have the villain explode their home towns, frame them for crimes, damage their reputations, hurt their moms, ruin their NPC friends, and eat their pets.

Each of the classes you mention has no provision for partial preparation of spells.


""Each cleric must choose a time when she must spend 1 hour each day in quiet contemplation or supplication to regain her daily allotment of spells.""
""A druid must spend 1 hour each day in a trance-like meditation on the mysteries of nature to regain her daily allotment of spells.""
""[A wizard]  must choose and prepare his spells ahead of time by getting 8 hours of sleep and spending 1 hour studying his spellbook.""


Using a strict reading of the rules as they are written, that's exactly how long preparing all of the appropriate caster's spells takes, and stopping early means no prepared spells. Yes, the day after the massive battle that exhausted all his spells, even Count Slimeheart, Archmage of the Drooling Tower, if interrupted 1 min. before finishing his hour of study, will find himself with no spells prepared.

But, as per Preparing Wizard Spells, a wizard


  [p]reparing some smaller portion of his daily capacity takes a proportionally smaller amount of time, but always at least 15 minutes, the minimum time required to achieve the proper mental state.


Thus, a wizard can choose beforehand after resting to prepare a fraction of his spells, yet it's up to the DM if the wizard who planned to spend an hour preparing but actually spent less time preparing has prepared some of his spells or none at all.

Likewise, as per Preparing Divine Spells, divine spell casters who prepare spells must meditate for at least 15 min. at their appointed or chosen time, but can also leave spell slots unfilled for filling later, taking 15 min. per quarter of spells.

(A clever wizard or divine caster of prepared spells may start preparing 25% of his spells in 15-min. bursts instead of 1-hour long stretches, or the DM can just assume every experienced caster does this. I'm going to go out on a limb and say that this isn't the default method of spell preparation because the default method of 1 hour and get 'em all makes bookkeeping easier and arguments fewer.)

...And sorcerers need only 15 min. to concentrate...

Although sorcerers lack many problems their more devout and studious compatriots possess...


  Unlike a wizard or a cleric, a sorcerer need not prepare her spells in advance. She can cast any spell she knows at any time, assuming she has not yet used up her spells per day for that spell level.


...the section Magic under Sorcerers and Bards says


  Each day, sorcerers and bards must focus their minds on the task of casting their spells. A sorcerer or bard needs 8 hours of rest (just like a wizard), after which she spends 15 minutes concentrating. (A bard must sing, recite, or play an instrument of some kind while concentrating.) During this period, the sorcerer or bard readies her mind to cast her daily allotment of spells. Without such a period to refresh herself, the character does not regain the spell slots she used up the day before.


So there's a 15 min. window during which a sorcerer still hasn't regained yesterday's used spell slots upon awakening from 8 hours rest, but then the sorcerer's ready to go. (Of course, there's also the 50/50 chance he's 1 entire spell level below other full casters, but that's beside the point.)

...So the the GM could make a house rule that such concentration takes longer than 15 min.

If made at the campaign's beginning, a house rule mandating that the sorcerer (and similar casters like the bard) must spend, instead, an hour concentrating upon awakening from 8 hours rest is reasonable. Although such characters often have hard enough lives, such characters are also usually full casters, so it's not as damaging a house rule as, for example, a house rule that somehow nerfs melee attacks. It's a burden, certainly, but it's not an excessive burden so far as house rules go.

However, a GM who makes such a house rule mid-campaign then attacks the party of sorcerers 16 min. into their preparation time is really just asking his players to leave.



An Aside: Please don't attack PCs while they're preparing spells. If you do, they'll try to do the same to the bad guys. You don't want to spend a whole afternoon making a wizard baddie only to have the baddie dead before his turn because the PCs interrupted him while he was studying, so don't do that to the PCs your players have been tinkering with for months either.

If you're afraid of the PCs downing the big bad evil guy early, don't use him! Send instead paid assassins, bound or allied creatures, created minions, simulacra, projected images, or fanatics. Have the baddie mail threatening letters containing a magic mouth or explosive runes. While the PCs aren't around, have the villain explode their home towns, frame them for crimes, damage their reputations, hurt their moms, ruin their NPC friends, and eat their pets. Sending the BBEG into harm's way means the PCs should have a chance to end him. (And any method the GM uses to save the BBEG should eventually be accessible to the PCs!) If the only way to further the plot is a house rule that mandates sorcerers concentrate longer, it might be time to consider—sadly—a different plot.

The program computes the rectangles in some order and I want to show them in the reverse order. (It seems difficult to me to write the lines of C++ output to a file in reverse order.)

459,459,714,"How to find out the ""serviceability"" of a car?","One of my concerns before purchasing a car is how expensive repairs are going to be down the road. For example my car up until recently was a Volvo 850, and the air conditioner didn't work in it; the cost of getting it fixed was significantly higher than other cars because of the way the A/C unit is installed in the car, so I went on without air conditioning. Another example is the service light in the car - while the car had a standard OBD-II port which could read error messages, it required a special Volvo reader to reset the service light.

I know a lot of generalizations can be made about one make versus another, but those are obviously not allowed on this site (in fact, I hope this question is allowed at all...) - so that's not what I'm looking for. And I know there is a wide range of problems a car can encounter, and many of them are universal - replacing tires, for (a bad) example.

So, just like I can go to KBB and look up the recommended price of a car, is there someplace I can go to look up a make &amp; model of a car and see what proprietary, extra-expensive parts are in the car? Something that, for example, I could have put in the Volvo 850 and it would have told me about those above-mentioned peculiarities alongside undoubtedly a number of other proprietary bits that I didn't have problems with.

3077,3077,4898,Java 8 -- How do I calculate (milli)seconds from now using xsd:duration,"I feel like this question has been asked in one way or another, but I'm still not confident of my result.

I have an xsd:duration which will give me a desired expiration described in years, months, days, and seconds. I can collect the integer values of these parts with, for example, duration.getYears() or duration.getMonths().

Because my chosen db is Cassandra, I want to exploit the TTL option, which will automatically expire an inserted row after a specified number of seconds.

The critical part is getting from xsd:duration to an integer/long value of seconds which respects the Gregorian calendar (where 1 month from now is not simply 30.41 days, but 31).

At the moment, I'm using the following code:

LocalDateTime then = LocalDateTime.now().plusYears(duration.getYears()).plusMonths(duration.getMonths()).plusDays(duration.getDays()).plusHours(duration.getHours()).plusMinutes(duration.getMinutes()).plusSeconds(duration.getSeconds());
long ttlMillis = then.toInstant(ZoneOffset.UTC).toEpochMilli() - Instant.now().toEpochMilli();


Is there a quicker/cleaner way to do this?

I'm also not sure if I should worry about large durations... My particular use cases wouldn't call for anything larger that 2 years.
",blackstrype,https://stackoverflow.com/users/404750,"Informational note for all: 

You are talking about javax.xml.datatype.Duration, not java.time.Duration.

Your questions:

a) Is there a quicker way to do this (using Java-8)? Hardly. The designers of JSR-310-team responsible for the new date- and time library in Java-8 have not cared much about the bridge to the existing XML-classes in JDK. So there is no direct way to convert from xml-duration to any kind of JSR-310-duration.

Keep also in mind that the JSR-310-classes Period (with state consisting of years, months and days) and Duration (with state consisting of seconds and nanoseconds) are not really designed for representing an xml-duration (which has more units as seen in your code). So I doubt if we might see a well-defined bridge between JSR-310 and XML in the future (maybe only on millisecond base?). The sign handling is also completely different in JSR-310 and XML. So be cautious if you have negative sign in xml-duration.

b) Is there a cleaner way to do this (using Java-8)? Yes, a little bit. One thing to consider is: I would use the clock as time source for the actual instant only once and not twice as you have done it. Example for this (very) minor improvement:

Instant now = Instant.now();
LocalDateTime start = now.atOffset(ZoneOffset.UTC).toLocalDateTime();
LocalDateTime end = 
  start.plusYears(duration.getYears())
  .plusMonths(duration.getMonths())
  .plusDays(duration.getDays())
  .plusHours(duration.getHours())
  .plusMinutes(duration.getMinutes())
  .plusSeconds(duration.getSeconds());
long deltaInMillis = end.toInstant(ZoneOffset.UTC).toEpochMilli() - now.toEpochMilli();


Second thing to consider: The xml-duration class is designed for interoperation with java.util.Date. So you also have this short alternative:

Date start = new Date();
long deltaInMillis = duration.getTimeInMillis(start);


This alternative is not only much shorter, but is probably also more precise because it takes into account the millisecond part. According to the documentation you should only worry about the correctness if you have duration items in long range (excessing the range of int). Another topic is the relationship to any hidden timezone calculation. I have not seen any hint in the documentation, so this is maybe the only item which can make you worry (either local timezone? or UTC? - not tested).

c) Why worry about large durations? Even if your duration is larger than let's say some centuries possibly crossing the validity limits of historic gregorian calendar, you should keep in mind that xml-duration only uses the proleptic gregorian calendar, not the historical one. And LocalDateTime uses the same proleptic gregorian calendar, too. If such a large duration is related to any real data is another good question however.

806,806,1276,Specifying the keyboard layout for Chinese input,"I use both Chinese (pinyin) and Japanese (romaji) input and am used to having them mapped to a standard US keyboard layout. However my regional setting is Switzerland since I'm studying here and “internet services may vary according to region”. Strangely, the Japanese input uses the US keyboard layout, but Chinese uses a European layout (not sure what, but z and y are switched). (Irrelevant to problem).

My inputs are, in this order:

English (US)
German
Japanese (Kotoeri)
Chinese

As Tom pointed out, in Kotoeri's preferences the layout can be defined. The Chinese input however uses the last layout of a Latin input, in this case German.

There also doesn't seem to be an option to customise the order of these inputs. My workaround is to cycle backwards, but this obviously is a special case. If anyone has a better solution it would be appreciated.
",Steve Heim,https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/22390,"If it's what I think you're asking, you can set this, but it's really hard to find.  (It's not in the System Preferences app.)

On OS X in the Japanese interface, there's no ""Romaji"" input, but based on some screenshots I found, I'm assuming this is ""英字"" (eiji, i.e., halfwidth Latin characters).  All of the Japanese input methods use a system called Kotoeri (ことえり).  When a Kotoeri input method is selected, from the keyboard layout menubar menu in the top right, choose ""環境設定を表示"" (""Show Preferences"", maybe?), which is indented a bit under a ""Kotoeri"" heading.  (It disappears if you have a non-Kotoeri input method selected.)  There, you can choose a base keyboard input method for Kotoeri to use.

However, my regional background is Switzerland, because I study here, ""Internet services may vary from region to region."". Curiously, Japanese input uses the U.S. keyboard layout, while Chinese uses the European layout (I don't know what it is, but Z and y are exchanged). (not related to the problem).","If it's what I think you're asking, you can set this, but it's really hard to find.  (It's not in the System Preferences app.)

On OS X in the Japanese interface, there's no ""Romaji"" input, but based on some screenshots I found, I'm assuming this is ""英字"" (eiji, i.e., halfwidth Latin characters).  All of the Japanese input methods use a system called Kotoeri (ことえり).  When a Kotoeri input method is selected, from the keyboard layout menubar menu in the top right, choose ""環境設定を表示"" (""Show Preferences"", maybe?), which is indented a bit under a ""Kotoeri"" heading.  (It disappears if you have a non-Kotoeri input method selected.)  There, you can choose a base keyboard input method for Kotoeri to use.

would result in a hash table with values $0, 12, 24 \dots $ in the first bucket, $1, 13, 25 \dots$ etc. in the second and so on.

Essentially they are the same thing. I didn't reduce collisions and I didn't spread things out any better by using the prime number hash code and I can't see how it is ever beneficial.
",CodyBugstein,https://cs.stackexchange.com/users/4348,"If your hash function is of the form $h(k)=a\times k \mod m$ where $m$ is prime and $a$ is chosen at random, then the probability that 2 distinct keys hash to the same bucket is $1\over m$.

4457,4457,7073,What planets in the Romulan system survived the supernova?,"It was told that Romulus was devastated into pieces by the nearby star that went supernova. 

But what happened to Remus (and the Remans for that matter) or any other minor planets in that system?

From the Star Trek: Countdown comic series, Nero and his crew were mining in the Hobus system at the time the star went supernova.
",Jared,https://scifi.stackexchange.com/users/1338,"According to Memory Alpha the supernova was a nearby star, (but supposedly NOT the star Romulus and Remus orbited). This is never clearly explained or diagrammed so we can understand how this happened. (For this example we will assume it was the Romulan star which went nova to explain potential effects.)


  In 2387, a star close to Romulus went supernova, endangering the entire galaxy. Ambassador Spock created a red matter singularity which consumed the star, but not before the supernova reached Romulus, destroying the planet. (Star Trek)




Romulus (and presumably Remus) is destroyed in the supernova.

Given the explosion was clearly seen to engulf Romulus in a fiery wake, the star had to be relatively close, otherwise, the Romulans would have (and should have) been able to evacuate in a timely fashion.

Normally, any planets within the orbit of a star going supernova are more than likely destroyed in the resulting blast. Remus was the third planet in the Romulan star system so it was likely as destroyed as Romulus was.

In a normal supernova, the energy of the explosion is strong enough to strip away even the dense atmospheres of local gas giants, leaving only their metallic or compressed matter cores. Depending on the size of the star and the distance between the local stars, nearby star systems can be affected by gamma ray and other radiation effects.


  During this short interval of a star explosion, a supernova can radiate as much energy as the Sun is expected to emit over its entire life span. The explosion expels much or all of a star's material at a velocity of up to 30,000 km/s (10% of the speed of light), driving a shock wave into the surrounding interstellar medium. This shock wave sweeps up an expanding shell of gas and dust called a supernova remnant.


All supernova are not created equal but most will have devastating effects on their local star systems. This can include emissions of gamma ray pulses and other energetic radiations including dangerous cosmic rays.

However, learning about how pointer arithmetic works in the abstract will not make you good at using pointers in a real program.  When it comes time to take on a mess of 10K lines of code and make some changes to the pointer arithmetic, you will need to be able to reason at a very abstract level, making strategic decisions to balance different concerns about how your changes will affect the code.

455,455,709,What is it called when a music has two concurrent tempos,"I've recently watched a BBC documentary about the history of music and recall an episode where they talk about music that has two distinct tempos (and possibly time signatures) at the same time for different sets of instruments.

Still, I can't remember how this is called and who are the famous composers that composed that way (Stravinsky?).
",Arthur Rizzo,https://music.stackexchange.com/users/16830,"This sort of thing has been explored pretty deeply by, among other people, Conlon Nancarrow. He used player pianos to perform pieces which would most likely have been too complex for anyone to perform organically. One way in which he complicated things was that he used what he called a tempo canon. As discussed here, one such piece was his Study for Player Piano 41a. It used multiple voices, each with its own tempo and the ratios were on a strict, but irrational ratio. If the ratio between tempos was rational, it would line up, or converge, so that two notes could fall at the same time. However, if the ratio was irrational, they would never converge and dance around each other until the piece ended.

This basic concept, although the effect can be jarring, is really not very different from polyrhythms and polymeters. It's just obfuscated by using complicated ratios. For example, if you have a bar and a main voice hit four evenly spaced beats, you have the standard quarter note pulse in 4/4. You can fit 3 notes evenly into that same bar in a second voice and the second voice will be playing half-note triplets. For every four notes in the main voice and every three notes in the second voice, the voices will play together. That's your bar. And that's a polyrhythm. That would be a 4:3 ratio. I'm not sure that's how it's typically notated, but the idea translates. You can imagine how this can be seen as two voices at different tempos. Say maybe one voice in 4/4 at 120 and another voice in 3/4 at 90. They would line up the same way.

Here's another example. If your main voice plays 8 eighth notes before repeating and your second voice plays 7 eighth notes before repeating, they will line up every 56 (7×8) eighth notes. In other words, after your main voice repeats seven times and your second voice repeats eight times. That's a polymeter. Now you can see how these concepts can get mixed up. As the ratios get more complicated (ie 128:73) or less rational (ie √2:φ), the tempos line up less and less and the individual tempos will get closer and/or less distinguishable. That is where you cross the line into tempo canon territory.


  Note: I understand that 'irrational ratio' is a terrible oxymoron, but
  I can't think of better terminology. Also, this is just the one conceptualization of
  the multiple tempo idea. There is world music where this is done organically and many
  people have already mentioned other composers who have worked with the idea. But hopefully this helps.

He used player pianos to perform pieces which would most likely have been too complex for anyone to perform organically.

It used multiple voices, each with its own tempo and the ratios were on a strict, but irrational ratio.

  the app should store the token in a database along with the user_id

256,256,413,How to find bible verses?,"This is a question one of my Catechism students asked.  We were playing a Bible based board game where if you don't know the answer you look it up in the Bible.  That's pretty great, if you know how to find verses in the Bible.  

But, given a standard super thick, thin paged Bible with no tabs and characteristically ignoring the index page like one would expect an eighth grader might, what mnemonic and memorization devices do people use to find the relative position of certain books in the Bible?

(I'd prefer Catholic answers using Catholic Bibles, but any wisdom is appreciated)
",Peter Turner,https://christianity.stackexchange.com/users/4,"I learned this technique on Protestant Bibles but you could easily adapt it for any Bible. It works best if you have everyone use their own Bible so that they can see how the technique applies to the Bible they use most.


Psalms is usually at the center of most Bibles. If you're looking for Psalms you try to open to the middle of the book.
The New Testament tends to start around the last quarter of the Bible.
So let's say you're looking for John 3:16.

It's in the New Testament so it's in the last quarter of the Bible.
It's a Gospel so it's at the front of that last quarter.
Flip to about the last quarter of the book. If you land on John great.
If you landed somewhere else is it before or after John?



This also goes hand in hand with memorizing the order of the books which the best I can do is a song that I think I might still have somewhere on VHS but you can just hit up YouTube and find something your kids will like.

Even more helpful is understanding the sections of the Bible.


Law
History
Poetry &amp; Wisdom
Major Prophets
Minor Prophets
Gospels
Pauline Epistles
General Epistles
Prophecy


So from the example above, if the open the Bible to somewhere other than John it goes:


What book are you on?
Is it before or after John?


Is it Old Testament or New? If it's old you move back. New could be either way.
What section is it in? If it's a Gospel, which one? (in this case any one means move back slowly)
If it's not at least one of the minor prophets then you're probably way too far ahead.
Likewise if you landed in Revelation then you're too far back. (This actually happens because of maps and other stuff they cram into Bibles these days.)



It plays out like a game of 20 questions. Every time you move you repeat the steps. I don't remember it taking long for us to pick this up but, the more time they spend using an actual Bible with no search aids, the faster they'll get it.

Now I have 3 lines of code that do work as expected and all do the same thing purpose wise.

int num;
num = bar&lt;int&gt;(foo);
num = bar(new Func&lt;int, bool&gt;(foo));
num = bar((int i) =&gt; true );


My question is ""Why do I need to explicitly specify T for bar for the first example?"" The reason I wonder this is because the compiler turns the first two examples into the same line of code. Using ILSpy I see that the code compiles to this.

num = Program.bar&lt;int&gt;(new Func&lt;int, bool&gt;(Program.foo));
num = Program.bar&lt;int&gt;(new Func&lt;int, bool&gt;(Program.foo));
num = Program.bar&lt;int&gt;((int i) =&gt; true);


I don't understand why the compiler can't infer the type from the fact that I only have one function called foo, and it does fit the template so to speak. Now if I had created another function bool foo(bool i) I would understand if the compiler complained that there was some ambiguity and it didn't know which one I wanted and that I should specify the type argument explicitly.

This of course is just me being lazy, but it is just something I was expecting and was surprised when the compiler wasn't picking up my slack.
",BenVlodgi,https://stackoverflow.com/users/1812944,"I'm on the bus, so, short answer.

type inference of t requires knowing the formal parameter type of the delegate type in the argument.

conversion of the method group to the delegate type does overload resolution as though the method group was invoked with the arguments of the formal parameter types of the target delegate.

but those types are what we are trying to deduce!

this is circular reasoning, so type inference rejects it. A method group conversion requires that the formal parameter types be deduced from some other argument.

you have no other arguments.

so inference fails.

that the group contains only one method is irrelevant. It would be bizarre if adding more methods to the group caused inference to fail. The rule that a group of overloads is resolved through overload resolution is a sensible one, and that requires knowing the parameters. You don't get to run the inferences backwards just because a method group happens to be a singleton.

4289,4289,6833,Which Windows 7 to install?,"I have 2GB of RAM on my laptop, which is the max.  

Should I install 32 bit version or 64 bit version?
",AngryHacker,https://superuser.com/users/2805,"The biggest issue you should care about is drivers. 

Do 64bit drivers exist for your laptop? Check that before you do anything, as lot of hardware companies don't have any available. If you can't find Windows 7 drivers, usually the Vista drivers will work.

Ontop of that, if you are using your laptop for heavy-lifting applications that require a lot of memory, then 64bit is better. Though with 2gb of RAM it's barely going to make any difference for you, as 64bit excels because it can support more than the ~3gb limit of 32 bit windows. So the advantage is once you have more than 4gb of ram.

The heavy-lifting applications usually are 3D software: Maya, 3DS Max, or graphics applications such as Photoshop and Gimp. Also gaming on 64bit gives slightly faster framerates, though that's a product of the processor and motherboard not the operating system. Your existing games may not work on 64 bit Windows.

You are also likely to find some installers refuse to install on a 64bit version too, mostly from dumb installers looking at registry keys.

My choice would be stick with 32 bit Windows 7, as a laptop (atleast one that only has 2gb of RAM) is probably not going to be used for any of those applications, or gaming.

  Light grey text on a white background and small text size both lead to
  an increased orbicularis oculi activity and decreased blinking. These

  find similar indicators of eye fatigue with poor font quality or
  condensed letter spacing.


For examples of good color combinations with sufficient contrast I recommend reading this article on UX matters which has this to say on what contrast to choose for minimal eye strain.


  Ensuring the Readability of Text Through Contrast
  
  For backgrounds behind text, use solid, contrasting colors, and avoid
  the use of textures and patterns, which can make letterforms difficult
  to distinguish or even illegible. Choose combinations of text color
  and background color with care. Value contrast between body text and
  its background color should be a minimum of about eighty percent.
  
  Contrast with a white background
  
  Black text on a white background provides maximal value contrast and,
  therefore, optimal readability for body text. The contrast between
  charcoal gray (#333333) text and a white background is about eighty
  percent—thus giving minimally good value contrast. - 
  
  The following dark colors provide good to excellent contrast and
  legibility for text on a white background: 
  
  


The importance of contrast with regards to reducing eye strain is explained further in the article as highlighted below


  Contrast and Legibility “To provide the best legibility, ensure that text contrasts adequately with its background in both hue and
  value.”
  
  To provide the best legibility, ensure that text contrasts adequately
  with its background in both hue and value. When there is insufficient
  contrast between the hue or value of text and its background color,
  the text appears blurred or has a halo effect around it, making it
  difficult to read and resulting in eye strain.


That said the choice of text and size is also critical. To quote the above referenced eye magazine site article


  Designers usually try to use high quality text when readers are
  expected to read for any period of time, but using a comfortable text
  size is not always possible. In print, there is a trade-off between
  type size and the amount of text that can fit on a page. Nine-point
  type may be chosen because it is cost-effective, whereas eleven-point
  would be easier to identify visually and would reduce eye strain.
  Twelve-point text may be needed for good character definition on
  computer screens, because readers frequently sit further from a screen
  than from a printed page, but many Web pages specify small font sizes
  despite the fact that it costs no more to create additional or longer
  pages. Designers need to argue for larger text sizes to reduce the
  effects of eye strain.


From an Accessiblity standpoint I also recommend looking at W3C guidelines on recommended level of contrast


  1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum): The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for the
  following: (Level AA)
  
  
  Large Text: Large-scale text and images of large-scale text have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1;
  Incidental: Text or images of text that are part of an inactive user interface component, that are pure decoration, that are not
  visible to anyone, or that are part of a picture that contains
  significant other visual content, have no contrast requirement.
  Logotypes: Text that is part of a logo or brand name has no minimum contrast requirement.
  


You should also considering offering  a high contrast option which will allow users to work comfortably in low light situations. It would be a good idea to provide multiple options like how kindle handles it as shown below.


With regards the benefits of using the high contrast mode in dark rooms,I recommend looking at this snippet from this article


  However, using light text on a dark background also has its advantages
  for attracting less light in a dark room.


That said, while reversing color ensure this taken care of better readability


  When reversing colour out, eg white text on black, make sure you
  increase the leading, tracking and decrease your font-weight. This
  applies to all widths of Measure. White text on a black background is
  a higher contrast to the opposite, so the letterforms need to be wider
  apart, lighter in weight and have more space between the lines.


Lastly here are some articles on color schemes suitable for coding which might help you make your final decision (I know your application does not deal with users coding on it but the use case is similar here..)

Solarized color schemes help you code longer :To quote the article


  Solarized doesn’t just claim to be easy to read based on the
  designer’s personal preferences, though. Ethan Schoonover, the
  designer responsible for the project, clearly explains the rationale
  behind the decisions he made on the project site. The most prominently
  visible is the use of selective contrast:
  
  “On a sunny summer day I love to read a book outside. Not right in the
  sun; that’s too bright. I’ll hunt for a shady spot under a tree. The
  shaded paper contrasts with the crisp text nicely. If you were to
  actually measure the contrast between the two, you’d find it is much
  lower than black text on a white background (or white on black) on
  your display device of choice. Black text on white from a computer
  display is akin to reading a book in direct sunlight and tires the
  eye. Solarized reduces brightness contrast but, unlike many low
  contrast colorschemes, retains contrasting hues (based on colorwheel
  relations) for syntax highlighting readability.” White-on-black
  themes, popular among developers who want to reduce eye strain, are an
  improvement over black-on-white themes, but the contrast is still far
  too great.

  “On a sunny summer day I love to read a book outside. Not right in the
  sun; that’s too bright. I’ll hunt for a shady spot under a tree. The
  shaded paper contrasts with the crisp text nicely. If you were to
  actually measure the contrast between the two, you’d find it is much
  lower than black text on a white background (or white on black) on
  your display device of choice. Black text on white from a computer
  display is akin to reading a book in direct sunlight and tires the
  eye. Solarized reduces brightness contrast but, unlike many low
  contrast colorschemes, retains contrasting hues (based on colorwheel
  relations) for syntax highlighting readability.” White-on-black
  themes, popular among developers who want to reduce eye strain, are an
  improvement over black-on-white themes, but the contrast is still far
  too great.

2845,2845,4528,Interacting with openCPU,"I've stumbled across an awesome open source project called openCPU.org and I'm tremendously excited about the project.  As a research scientist trying to create a website hosting my work, I would love nothing more than to be able to run R on the cloud to have my scripts run in real time and show up on my webpages.  So a big time thanks to Jeroen for making this project happen.

With that, onto my question.

How the heck do I interact with openCPU?

I can put an example function into ""run some code"" at:

http://public.opencpu.org/userapps/opencpu/opencpu.demo/runcode/

And retrieve a PNG image of my code, which is great!

But how do I do that in my own webpage, or via a URL?

I can get the object of my original code upload from this page, something like: ""x3ce3bf3e33""

If it is a function similar to:

myfun &lt;-function(){

x = seq(1,6.28)
y = cos(x)
p = plot(x,y)
print(p)
# also tried return(p)
}


Shouldn't I be able to call it via:

http://public.opencpu.org/R/tmp/x3ce3bf3e33/png

What about with input variables? e.g.:

myfun &lt;-function(foo){

x = seq(1,foo)
y = cos(x)
p = plot(x,y)
print(p)
}


I feel that perhaps there is something I am missing.  How do I specify ""GET"" or ""POST"" with the url?

EDIT

Ok in response to @Jeroen below, I need to use to use POST and GET with the API.  Now my question is extend to the following issue of getting PHP to interact with it correctly.  

Say I have the code:

&lt;?php

$foo = 'bar';
$options = array(
    'method' =&gt; 'POST',
    'foo' =&gt; $foo,
    );
$url = ""http://public.opencpu.org/R/tmp/x0188b9b9ce/save"";
$result = drupal_http_request($url,$options); // drupal function
?&gt;


How do I then access what is passed back in $result? I am looking to get a graph.  It looks like this:

{
    ""object"" : null,
    ""graphs"" : [
        ""x2acba9501a""
    ],
    ""files"" : {}
} 


The next step will be to GET the image, something along the lines of:

$newurl = ""http://public.opencpu.org/R/tmp/"".$result[""graph""].""/png"";
$image = drupal_http_request($newurl);
echo $image;


But I don't know how to access the individual elements of $result?

EDIT #2

Ok guys, I've gotten this to work, thanks to the answer below and to multiple other help sessions, and a lot of smashing my head against the monitor.

Here we go, done with cURL

&lt;?php

$ch = curl_init();
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_URL, 'http://public.opencpu.org/R/tmp/x0188b9b9ce/save');
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POST, 1); // Method is ""POST""
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, 1); // Returns the curl_exec string, rather than just Logical value
$result = curl_exec($ch);
curl_close($ch);
$new = json_decode($result,true); // $result is in 'json' format, decode it
$get = $new['graphs'][0]; // the 'hashkey for the image, ""x2acba9501a"" above

$img = 'http://public.opencpu.org/R/tmp/'.$get.'/png'; // link to the png image

echo &lt;&lt;&lt;END  // use this to display an image from the url
&lt;a href=""$img""&gt;
&lt;img src=""$img""&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
END

  1 Kings 22:19-28
  
  19 Micaiah continued, “Therefore hear the word of the Lord: I saw the Lord sitting on his throne with all the multitudes of heaven standing around him on his right and on his left. 20 And the Lord said, ‘Who will entice Ahab into attacking Ramoth Gilead and going to his death there?’
  
  “One suggested this, and another that. 21 Finally, a spirit came forward, stood before the Lord and said, ‘I will entice him.’
  
  22 “‘By what means?’ the Lord asked.
  
  “‘I will go out and be a deceiving spirit in the mouths of all his prophets,’ he said.
  
  “‘You will succeed in enticing him,’ said the Lord. ‘Go and do it.’
  
  23 “So now the Lord has put a deceiving spirit in the mouths of all these prophets of yours. The Lord has decreed disaster for you.”
  
  24 Then Zedekiah son of Kenaanah went up and slapped Micaiah in the face. “Which way did the spirit from[a] the Lord go when he went from me to speak to you?” he asked.
  
  25 Micaiah replied, “You will find out on the day you go to hide in an inner room.”

I would very much like to use a hybrid, but I've had trouble making one that would work at early levels (we are starting at 1).

I don't want to be, just another striker, or just another tank.  

I do enjoy all classes, but enjoy tanks and healers that lean towards strikers the best.  

How can I make a hybrid character which is unique but not useless at low levels?

Any ideas on enclosures I can use to protect them from the weather?
",David I.,https://diy.stackexchange.com/users/21025,"You need to think this through more carefully.

First of all, Ft. Worth freezes every winter and some winters it gets really cold at night. Just last night it was below 15F. So, if you were to install your imaginary system it would have frozen solid and been destroyed (water expands when it freezes and it will rupture every single cannister, fitting, line and valve in the system when it does this).

Secondly, what do you mean by ""filtration""? Are you just talking carbon filtration to remove a little sediment, large-scale microbial filtration, osmotic water purification? There is a wide range of levels of filtration depending on how small the objects are that you want to remove. Anything less than an osmotic purifier is pretty much useless because they will pass through all dissolved solids and most pathogens (like e. coli etc). If you just want to get rid of some rust/dirt, then carbon is correct, but if you want to purify the water to any degree you will need osmosis.

Thirdly any filter reduces the water flow a LOT and takes pressure down to about zero. So that means that if you want to, say, take a shower, you will have to repressurize the water after you filter it. So, the filter puts the water in a large tank, then you have to have a high-power pump that will repressurize the water coming out of that tank. For a typical home you will need a tank at least as big as a water heater, and even then you will run dry more often than you think. I would probably have AT LEAST one water-heater-sized tank FOR EVERY PERSON in the household. If you have a 4-person household, that is a big tank, 200 gallons or more.

Finally, your filtration system has to produce water faster than you use it. A typical family uses about 400 gallons per day. As osmotic system capable of producing 400 gallons per day costs about $10,000 to $25,000 and is the size of an SUV. Starting to get the picture?

3393,3393,5411,How does Christianity deal with biblical criticism related to the Old Testament?,"As an orthodox Jew I have seen quite a stir lately regarding the topic of biblical criticism, specifically towards the Old Testament (Torah). 

I have perused several questions in this stack which seem to address this topic in general, and learned a lot about apologetics, but I have not seen answers that address some of the major claims of biblical criticism, especially as it pertains to the Old Testament. 

For example:


The story of Noah and the flood seems to be contradicted by archaeological evidence as well as having been 'borrowed' from earlier flood narratives such as the Gilgamesh story
Many of the portions of the Old Testament seem to be borrowed from earlier near eastern texts such as the Hammurabi code 
The notion that there are multiple authors (documentary hypothesis) of the Old Testament.


In short, how does Christianity deal with some of the major contentions of biblical criticism towards the Old Testament?



I apologize if any parts of my question offend any sensibilities to which I am unaware. 
",user5796,https://christianity.stackexchange.com/users/5796,"
Archaeology does not contradict a worldwide flood. There are different opinions on the matter. For more in-depth information watch these presentations as they present an alternate view. Especially presentations 2 (A Universal Flood) and 3 (Bones in Stones). The complete presentation can be seen here, they are by a Researcher and Professor in Zoology.
This is also a matter of opinion. Many different people could write about a different event and that does not necessarily mean they borrowed from one another. They merely wrote about the event. The Epic of Gilgamesh could just easily be a story ""based on true events."" Just like today's movies, much of it could've been made up just for entertainment value, or to fit into a certain belief system. One more thing about this. Just because they were written first, does not necessarily mean they are more truthful. The reason we believe that the Genesis account is truthful is because we believe that the whole Bible is inspired. Jesus spoke about Noah, Lot, Adam, and other Old Testament characters as historical figures, not simply characters from a fable.
Also along with what Narnian said about literary analysis that suggests that there were multiple authors, in the New Testament some of the writings are attributed to the people that we believe today. For example, Luke attributes the quotation from Isaiah to Isaiah; Luke 4:16-18.

4172,4172,6656,Creating a Bridged Network Connection in Terminal,"Okay, I'm struggling a bit here. I'm not all that good with Terminal and sorting out network issues using it but I've managed to scrape by so far.

Without using Internet Sharing (because controlling that via Terminal as per my question here doesn't actually seem to work in Yosemite) how can I share my internet connection from one interface (lets say en0) to another (again, lets say en1)?

I kind of understand that Internet Sharing creates a bridge (usually called bridge100) and then uses bootpd (I think) to establish a DHCP server and NAT to route all traffic from 192.168.2.xxx (which is the bridged network) through to your primary network.

4358,4358,6933,Why is it not dangerous to dissolve NaCl?,"$$\ce{H2O~(l) + NaCl~(s) -&gt;[\Delta] Na+~(aq) + Cl^{-}~(aq)}$$

When table salt is placed in water, it dissolves due to the polarity of water molecules. When solvation takes place, negatively polar sides of water molecules attach to $\ce{Na+}$ ions, and positively polar sides of water molecules attach to $\ce{Cl-}$ ions. The ions are then carried away by water molecules through diffusion. Since the sodium is now isolated from the chlorine, what keeps it from violently exploding with water in the following chemical reaction?

$$\ce{2Na + 2H2O -&gt; 2 NaOH + H2}$$

Also, since chlorine is poisonous, wouldn't that make drinking salted water extremely lethal?
",Daniel Pendergast,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/users/143,"[A really-good answer to this question should include quantitative evidence, but here is my hand-waving version...]

Solvated sodium ions ($\ce{Na+}$) aren't all that reactive.  Surrounded by a lot of polar water molecules, they're actually quite stable.  What you're thinking of is solid sodium (Na) which will ""react violently with water"" until it's all dissolved - dissolved that is, into stable sodium ions.

Same kind of logic applies to chlorine.  Solvated chloride ions ($\ce{Cl-}$) are stable and not nearly as poisonous as chlorine gas. (Note:  everything is poisonous at some level, i.e. ""the poison is in the dose"".  In saying chlorine gas is more poison, that really just means it is a more 'potent' poison:  it will kill at lower doses compared to chloride ions.)

Solid sodium and chlorine gas are at high energy states.  Since they can reach much lower energy states by ionzing in the presence  with water, the WILL break down and ionize in the presence of water

How to find the right tab id

Find the responsible tab container class. This is a child class of Mage_Adminhtml_Block_Widget_Tabs, in my case, Mage_Adminhtml_Block_Catalog_Product_Attribute_Edit_Tabs.

You'll find calls to $this-&gt;addTab(), usually in the methods _beforeToHtml(), or _construct(). The first parameter of addTab() is the tab id:

$this-&gt;addTab('labels', array(
    'label'     =&gt; Mage::helper('catalog')-&gt;__('Manage Label / Options'),

5331,5331,8470,How and when does SQL Agent update next_run_date/next_run_time values?,"I've been working on code in T-SQL to add new schedules to a SQL Agent job  using the sp_add_jobschedule proc in the msdb database.  When I add a new schedule (typically a run-once at a specific date/time) and immediately look at the values in sysjobschedules and sysschedules, I can see that the new schedule has been added and is tied to the job_id for my SQL Agent job. However, the values for next_run_date and next_run_time have 0 in them.  When I come back and look at them again in 2 or 3 minutes, they still show 0's in them.  However when I come back another 5 or 10 minutes later, it now correctly shows the date and time values corresponding to the next scheduled run.

So my questions are:


How often do these values get updated?
What process is it that updates these values?
If I were to add a schedule that was, say, 1 minute in the future, does that mean that the job will not run since the next_run_date/time haven't been updated yet?


Example of the code I use to add a new schedule:

exec msdb.dbo.sp_add_jobschedule @job_id = @jobID
                    , @name = @JobName
                    , @enabled = 1
                    , @freq_type = 1
                    , @freq_interval = 0
                    , @freq_subday_type = 0
                    , @freq_subday_interval = 0
                    , @freq_relative_interval = 0
                    , @freq_recurrence_factor = 0
                    , @active_start_date = @ScheduleRunDate
                    , @active_end_date = 99991231
                    , @active_start_time = @ScheduleRunTime
                    , @active_end_time = 235959


where @jobID is binary(16) that holds the job_id of the job in question, @ScheduleRunDate and @ScheduleRunTime are INTs with the date and time respectively.
",BBlake,https://dba.stackexchange.com/users/3898,"Short Answer

It looks like the data in msdb.dbo.sysjobschedules is updated by a background thread in SQL Agent, identified as SQLAgent - Schedule Saver, every 20 minutes (or less frequently, if xp_sqlagent_notify has not been called and no jobs have run in the meantime).

For more accurate information, look at next_scheduled_run_date in msdb.dbo.sysjobactivity. This is updated in real-time any time a job is changed or a job has run. As an added bonus, the sysjobactivity stores the data the right way (as a datetime column), making it a lot easier to work with than those stupid INTs.

That's the short answer: 


  It could be up to 20 minutes before sysjobschedules reflects the truth; however, sysjobactivity will always be up to date. If you want a lot more details about this, or how I figured it out...




Long Answer

If you care to follow the rabbit for a moment, when you call sp_add_jobschedule, this chain of events is set into motion:

msdb.dbo.sp_add_jobschedule == calls ==&gt; msdb.dbo.sp_add_schedule
                                         msdb.dbo.sp_attach_schedule

msdb.dbo.sp_attach_schedule == calls ==&gt; msdb.dbo.sp_sqlagent_notify

msdb.dbo.sp_sqlagent_notify == calls ==&gt; msdb.dbo.xp_sqlagent_notify


Now, we can't chase the rabbit any further, because we can't really peek into what xp_sqlagent_notify does. But I think we can presume that this extended procedure interacts with the Agent service and tells it that there has been a change to this specific job and schedule. By running a server-side trace we can see that, immediately, the following dynamic SQL is called by SQL Agent:

exec sp_executesql N'DECLARE @nextScheduledRunDate DATETIME 
  SET @nextScheduledRunDate = msdb.dbo.agent_datetime(@P1, @P2) 
  UPDATE msdb.dbo.sysjobactivity 
    SET next_scheduled_run_date = @nextScheduledRunDate 
    WHERE session_id = @P3 AND job_id = @P4',
N'@P1 int,@P2 int,@P3 int,@P4 uniqueidentifier',
20120819,181600,5,'36924B24-9706-4FD7-8B3A-1F9F0BECB52C'


It seems that sysjobactivity is updated immediately, and sysjobschedules is only updated on a schedule. If we change the new schedule to be once a day, e.g.

@freq_type=4, 
@freq_interval=1, 
@freq_subday_type=1, 
@freq_subday_interval=0, 
@freq_relative_interval=0, 
@freq_recurrence_factor=1, 


We still see the immediate update to sysjobactivity as above, and then another update after the job is finished. Various updates come from background and other threads within SQL Agent, e.g.:

SQLAgent - Job Manager
SQLAgent - Update job activity
SQLAgent - Job invocation engine
SQLAgent - Schedule Saver


A background thread (the ""Schedule Saver"" thread) eventually comes around and updates sysjobschedules; from my initial investigation it appears this is every 20 minutes, and only happens if xp_sqlagent_notify has been called due to a change made to a job since the last time it ran (I did not perform any further testing to see what happens if one job has been changed and another has been run, if the ""Schedule Saver"" thread updates both - I suspect it must, but will leave that as an exercise to the reader).

I am not sure if the 20-minute cycle is offset from when SQL Agent starts, or from midnight, or from something machine-specific. On two different instances on the same physical server, the ""Schedule Saver"" thread updated sysjobschedules, on both instances, at almost the exact same time - 18:31:37 &amp; 18:51:37 on one, and 18:31:39 &amp; 18:51:39 on the other. I did not start SQL Server Agent at the same time on these servers, but there is a remote possibility that the start times happened to be 20 minutes offset. I doubt it, but I don't have time right now to confirm by restarting Agent on one of them and waiting for more updates to happen.

I know who did it, and when it happened, because I placed a trigger there and captured it, in case I couldn't find it in the trace, or I inadvertently filtered it out.

CREATE TABLE dbo.JobAudit
(
  [action] CHAR(1),
  [table] CHAR(1), 
  hostname SYSNAME NOT NULL DEFAULT HOST_NAME(), 
  appname SYSNAME  NOT NULL DEFAULT PROGRAM_NAME(),
  dt DATETIME2     NOT NULL DEFAULT SYSDATETIME()

GO
CREATE TRIGGER dbo.schedule4 ON dbo.sysjobschedules FOR UPDATE
AS
  INSERT dbo.JobAudit([action], [table] SELECT 'U', 'S';
GO


That said, it is not hard to catch with a standard trace, this one even comes through as non-dynamic DML:

UPDATE msdb.dbo.sysjobschedules 
  SET next_run_date = 20120817, 
      next_run_time = 20000 
 WHERE (job_id = 0xB87B329BFBF7BA40B30D9B27E0B120DE 
 and schedule_id = 8)


If you want to run a more filtered trace to track this behavior over time (e.g. persisting through SQL Agent restarts instead of on-demand), you can run one that has appname = 'SQLAgent - Schedule Saver'...

So I think that if you want to know the next run time immediately, look at sysjobactivity, not sysjobschedules. This table is directly updated by Agent or its background threads (""Update job activity"", ""Job Manager"" and ""Job invocation engine"") as activity happens or as it is notified by xp_sqlagent_notify.

Be aware, though, that it is very easy to muck up either table - since there are no protections against deleting data from these tables. (So if you decided to clean up, for example, you can easily remove all the rows for that job from the activity table.) In this case I'm not exactly sure how SQL Server Agent gets or saves the next run date. Perhaps worthy of more investigation at a later date when I have some free time...

When I add a new schedule (usually run once on a specific date / time) and immediately view the values in sysjobschedules and sysschedules, I can see that the new schedule has been added and is associated with the job ID of my SQL agent job. However, there is a value of 0 in the next run date and next run time. When I come back in two or three minutes to see them again, they still show 0. However, when I come back in five or 10 minutes, it now correctly displays the date and time values corresponding to the next scheduled run.","Short Answer

It looks like the data in msdb.dbo.sysjobschedules is updated by a background thread in SQL Agent, identified as SQLAgent - Schedule Saver, every 20 minutes (or less frequently, if xp_sqlagent_notify has not been called and no jobs have run in the meantime).

For more accurate information, look at next_scheduled_run_date in msdb.dbo.sysjobactivity. This is updated in real-time any time a job is changed or a job has run. As an added bonus, the sysjobactivity stores the data the right way (as a datetime column), making it a lot easier to work with than those stupid INTs.

That's the short answer: 


  It could be up to 20 minutes before sysjobschedules reflects the truth; however, sysjobactivity will always be up to date. If you want a lot more details about this, or how I figured it out...




Long Answer

If you care to follow the rabbit for a moment, when you call sp_add_jobschedule, this chain of events is set into motion:

msdb.dbo.sp_add_jobschedule == calls ==&gt; msdb.dbo.sp_add_schedule
                                         msdb.dbo.sp_attach_schedule

msdb.dbo.sp_attach_schedule == calls ==&gt; msdb.dbo.sp_sqlagent_notify

msdb.dbo.sp_sqlagent_notify == calls ==&gt; msdb.dbo.xp_sqlagent_notify


Now, we can't chase the rabbit any further, because we can't really peek into what xp_sqlagent_notify does. But I think we can presume that this extended procedure interacts with the Agent service and tells it that there has been a change to this specific job and schedule. By running a server-side trace we can see that, immediately, the following dynamic SQL is called by SQL Agent:

exec sp_executesql N'DECLARE @nextScheduledRunDate DATETIME 
  SET @nextScheduledRunDate = msdb.dbo.agent_datetime(@P1, @P2) 
  UPDATE msdb.dbo.sysjobactivity 
    SET next_scheduled_run_date = @nextScheduledRunDate 
    WHERE session_id = @P3 AND job_id = @P4',
N'@P1 int,@P2 int,@P3 int,@P4 uniqueidentifier',
20120819,181600,5,'36924B24-9706-4FD7-8B3A-1F9F0BECB52C'


It seems that sysjobactivity is updated immediately, and sysjobschedules is only updated on a schedule. If we change the new schedule to be once a day, e.g.

@freq_type=4, 
@freq_interval=1, 
@freq_subday_type=1, 
@freq_subday_interval=0, 
@freq_relative_interval=0, 
@freq_recurrence_factor=1, 


We still see the immediate update to sysjobactivity as above, and then another update after the job is finished. Various updates come from background and other threads within SQL Agent, e.g.:

SQLAgent - Job Manager
SQLAgent - Update job activity
SQLAgent - Job invocation engine
SQLAgent - Schedule Saver


A background thread (the ""Schedule Saver"" thread) eventually comes around and updates sysjobschedules; from my initial investigation it appears this is every 20 minutes, and only happens if xp_sqlagent_notify has been called due to a change made to a job since the last time it ran (I did not perform any further testing to see what happens if one job has been changed and another has been run, if the ""Schedule Saver"" thread updates both - I suspect it must, but will leave that as an exercise to the reader).

I am not sure if the 20-minute cycle is offset from when SQL Agent starts, or from midnight, or from something machine-specific. On two different instances on the same physical server, the ""Schedule Saver"" thread updated sysjobschedules, on both instances, at almost the exact same time - 18:31:37 &amp; 18:51:37 on one, and 18:31:39 &amp; 18:51:39 on the other.

3289,3289,5243,"Is there a ""covariant derivative"" for conformal transformation?","A primary field is defined by its behavior under a conformal transformation $x\rightarrow x'(x)$:
$$\phi(x)\rightarrow\phi'(x')=\left|\frac{\partial x'}{\partial x}\right|^{-h}\phi(x)$$

It's fairly easy to see that the gradient of the field doesn't have this nice property under the same transformation, it gets a non homogeneous term. Still, is it possible to construct a derivative that would behave nicely under conformal mappings and give the usual derivative for Lorentz transformations? By adding a ""connection"" similarly as what is done in general relativity or gauge theories. And if not, why?
",Learning is a mess,https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/16890,"I) Here we discuss the problem of defining a connection on a conformal manifold $M$. We start with a conformal class $[g_{\mu\nu}]$ of globally$^{1}$ defined metrics 

$$\tag{1} g^{\prime}_{\mu\nu}~=~\Omega^2 g_{\mu\nu}$$

given by Weyl transformations/rescalings. Under mild assumption about the manifold $M$ (para-compactness), we may assume that there exists a conformal class $[A_{\mu}]$ of globally defined co-vectors/one-forms connected via Weyl transformations as

$$\tag{2} A^{\prime}_{\mu}~=~A_{\mu} + \partial_{\mu}\ln(\Omega^2). $$

In particular it is implicitly understood that a Weyl transformation [of a pair $(g_{\mu\nu},A_{\mu})$ of representatives] act in tandem/is synchronized with the same globally defined function $\Omega$ in eqs. (1) and (2) simultaneously.

II) Besides Weyl transformations, we can act (in the active picture) with diffeomorphisms. Locally, in the passive picture, the pair $(g_{\mu\nu},A_{\mu})$ transforms as covariant tensors

$$ \tag{3} g_{\mu\nu}~=~ \frac{\partial  x^{\prime \rho}}{\partial x^{\mu}} g^{\prime}_{\rho\sigma}\frac{\partial  x^{\prime \sigma}}{\partial x^{\nu}},  $$

$$ \tag{4} A_{\mu}~=~ \frac{\partial  x^{\prime \nu}}{\partial x^{\mu}} A^{\prime}_{\nu}. $$

under general coordinate transformations 

$$ \tag{5} x^{\mu} ~\longrightarrow~ x^{\prime \nu}~= ~f^{\nu}(x). $$

III) We next introduce the unique torsionfree tangent-space Weyl connection $\nabla$ with corresponding Christoffel symbols $\Gamma^{\lambda}_{\mu\nu}$ that covariantly preserves the metric in the following sense:

$$ \tag{6} (\nabla_{\lambda}-A_{\lambda})g_{\mu\nu}~=~0. $$

The Weyl connection $\nabla$ and its Christoffel symbols $\Gamma^{\lambda}_{\mu\nu}$ are independent of the pair $(g_{\mu\nu},A_{\mu})$ of representatives within the conformal class $[(g_{\mu\nu},A_{\mu})]$. (But the construction depends of course on the conformal class $[(g_{\mu\nu},A_{\mu})]$.) In other words, the Weyl Christoffel symbols are invariant under Weyl transformations 

$$ \tag{7} \Gamma^{\prime\lambda}_{\mu\nu}~=~\Gamma^{\lambda}_{\mu\nu}.$$ 

The lowered Weyl Christoffel symbols are uniquely given by

$$ \Gamma_{\lambda,\mu\nu}~=~g_{\lambda\rho}  \Gamma^{\rho}_{\mu\nu} $$
$$ ~=~\frac{1}{2}\left((\partial_{\mu}-A_{\mu})g_{\nu\lambda} +(\partial_{\nu}-A_{\nu})g_{\mu\lambda}-(\partial_{\lambda}-A_{\lambda})g_{\mu\nu} \right) $$
$$\tag{8} ~=~\Gamma^{(g)}_{\lambda,\mu\nu}+\frac{1}{2}\left(A_{\mu}g_{\nu\lambda}-A_{\nu}g_{\mu\lambda}+A_{\lambda}g_{\mu\nu} \right), $$

where $\Gamma^{(g)}_{\lambda,\mu\nu}$ denote the lowered Levi-Civita Christoffel symbols for the representative $g_{\mu\nu}$. 
The lowered Weyl Christoffel symbols $\Gamma_{\lambda,\mu\nu}$ scale under Weyl transformations as

$$ \tag{9} \Gamma^{\prime}_{\lambda,\mu\nu}~=~\Omega^2\Gamma_{\lambda,\mu\nu}.$$ 

The corresponding determinant bundle has a Weyl connection given by

$$ \tag{10} \Gamma_{\lambda}~=~\Gamma^{\mu}_{\lambda\mu}~=~(\partial_{\lambda}-A_{\lambda})\ln \sqrt{\det(g_{\mu\nu})}.$$

IV) Let us next define a conformal class $[\rho]$ of a density $\rho$ of weights $(w,h)$, who scales under Weyl transformations as

$$  \tag{11} \rho^{\prime}~=~ \Omega^w\rho $$

with Weyl weight $w$, and as a density

$$\tag{12} \rho^{\prime}~=~\frac{\rho}{J^h}$$

of weight $h$ under general coordinate transformations (5). Here

$$\tag{13} J ~:=~\det(\frac{\partial x^{\prime \nu}}{\partial x^{\mu}}) $$

is the Jacobian. 

Example: The determinant $\det(g_{\mu\nu})$ is a density with $h=2$ and $w=2d$, where $d$ is the dimension of the manifold $M$.

V) The concept of (conformal classes of) densities $\rho$ of weights $(w,h)$ can be generalized to (conformal classes of) tensor densities $T^{\mu_1\ldots\mu_m}_{\nu_1\ldots\nu_n}$ of weights $(w,h)$ in a straightforward manner. For instance, a vector density  of weights $(w,h)$ transforms as

$$ \tag{14} \xi^{\prime \mu}~=~ \frac{1}{J^h}\frac{\partial  x^{\prime \mu}}{\partial x^{\nu}} \xi^{\nu} $$

under general coordinate transformations (5), and scales as 

$$ \tag{15} \xi^{\prime \mu}~=~\Omega^w \xi^{\mu} $$

under Weyl transformations. Similarly, a co-vector density of weights $(w,h)$ transforms as

$$ \tag{16} \eta^{\prime}_{\mu}~=~ \frac{1}{J^h}\frac{\partial x^{\nu}}{\partial  x^{\prime \mu}} \eta_{\nu} $$

under general coordinate transformations (5), and scales as 

$$ \tag{17} \eta^{\prime}_{\mu}~=~\Omega^w \eta_{\mu} $$

under Weyl transformations. And so forth for arbitrary tensor densities $T^{\mu_1\ldots\mu_m}_{\nu_1\ldots\nu_n}$.

Example: The metric $g_{\mu\nu}$ is a tensor density with $h=0$ and $w=2$. The one-form $A_{\mu}$ is not a tensor density, cf. eq. (2). 

VI) Finally, one can discuss the definition of covariantly conserved (conformal classes of) tensor densities $T^{\mu_1\ldots\mu_m}_{\nu_1\ldots\nu_n}$. A density $\rho$ of weights $(w,h)$ is covariantly conserved if

$$\tag{18} (\nabla_{\lambda}-\frac{w}{2}A_{\lambda})\rho~\equiv~ (\partial_{\lambda}-h \Gamma_{\lambda}-\frac{w}{2}A_{\lambda})\rho~=~0. $$

A vector density of weights $(w,h)$ is covariantly conserved if

$$\tag{19}  (\nabla_{\lambda}-\frac{w}{2}A_{\lambda})\xi^{\mu}~\equiv~ (\partial_{\lambda}-h \Gamma_{\lambda}-\frac{w}{2}A_{\lambda})\xi^{\mu}+\Gamma_{\lambda\nu}^{\mu}\xi^{\nu} ~=~0. $$

A co-vector density of weights $(w,h)$ is covariantly conserved if

$$\tag{20}(\nabla_{\lambda}-\frac{w}{2}A_{\lambda})\eta_{\mu}~\equiv~  (\partial_{\lambda}-h \Gamma_{\lambda}-\frac{w}{2}A_{\lambda})\eta_{\mu}-\Gamma_{\lambda\mu}^{\nu}\eta_{\nu} ~=~0. $$

In particular, if $T^{\mu_1\ldots\mu_m}_{\nu_1\ldots\nu_n}$ is a tensor density of weights $(w,h)$, then the covariant derivative $(\nabla_{\lambda}-\frac{w}{2}A_{\lambda})T^{\mu_1\ldots\mu_m}_{\nu_1\ldots\nu_n}$ is also a tensor density of weights $(w,h)$.

418,418,649,What creates this strange flare and how to prevent it?,"I shot at a concert for the first time. The pictures were pretty good for the capability of my equipment, but on some shots, the light has a very strange flare. It isn't the usual rays, but some soft, non-symmetric form which I find quite strange, and, on most shots, distracting. 



On this image, you can see it just above Gino's head and also behind his back, to the right of the mic stand. I am not sure if the slight blue lines on the left side of the picture (they form a triangle aimed at Chris's head, maybe not visible on all monitors) are part of the problem or if they come from a different light source. 

What makes them appear, and how do I avoid them? 

I shot with a D90 with a 18-200 lens, no filters or hoods attached. The settings were quite strained (iso 3200, often at max length and max aperture for the length. This specific picture is 1/125, f 5.3, 95 mm). 
",rumtscho,https://photo.stackexchange.com/users/2099,"All cameras contain lenses which are actually comprised of several ""lens elements."" Lens flare is caused by non-image light which does not pass (refract) directly along its intended path, but instead reflects internally on lens elements any number of times (back and forth) before finally reaching the film or digital sensor



A good lens hood can nearly eliminate flare caused by stray light from outside the angle of view. Ensure that this hood has a completely non-reflective inner surface, such as felt, and that there are no regions which have rubbed off. Although using a lens hood may appear to be a simple solution, in reality most lens hoods do not extend far enough to block all stray light. This is particularly problematic when using 35 mm lenses on a digital SLR camera with a ""crop factor,"" because these lens hoods were made for the greater angle of view. In addition, hoods for zoom lenses can only be designed to block all stray light at the widest focal length.

Petal lens hoods often protect better than non-petal (round) types. This is because petal-style hoods take into account the aspect ratio of the camera's film or digital sensor, and so the angle of view is greater in one direction than the other.Placing a hand or piece of paper exterior to the side of the lens which is nearest the flare-inducing light source can also mimic the effect of a proper lens hood. 

Lens flare also depends on the lens used - fixed focal length (or prime) lenses are less susceptible to lens flare than zoom lenses. Other than having an inadequate lens hood at all focal lengths, more complicated zoom lenses often have to contain more lens elements. Zoom lenses therefore have more internal surfaces from which light can reflect.

Now for the Tavern Brawler feat it states that:


  You are proficient with improvised weapons and unarmed strikes.


And the rules for improvised weapons are:


  In many cases, an improvised weapon is similar to an actual weapon and can be treated as such. For example, a table leg is akin to a club. At the DM’s option, a character proficient with a weapon can use a similar object as if it were that weapon and use his or her proficiency bonus. An object that bears no resemblance to a weapon deals 1d4 damage. 


If the improvised weapon does not resemble a weapon, is simple, and is not heavy or two-handed, could a monk replace the d4 dice? For example if the monk is level 6 and has a unarmed attack of a d6, with a d6 dice instead?

1004,1004,1583,Is hacking back a valid security technique for companies?,"Recently it has come to light through the reverse engineering of hacking tools that there are vulnerabilities in them that could be exploited to take over an attackers computer during a remote hacking session. In other words, while they are hacking you, you could get into the system from which they are launching the attack to find out what they have managed to access, what the system is, or even p4wn it yourself. The goals would be damage control, deterrence, and ultimately being able to charge the perpetrator of the crime. 

Leaving aside the many legal, ethical, and moral considerations (if you are curious there's a debate recorded here), my question is whether hacking back using this technique has any value to a company. If it was ethical and legal would it be worth a company to invest in the systems and skills needed to make this work, or is it a waste of money? 

EDIT:
There's been several comments regarding leaving the legal and ethical considerations out of the question, so here's the explanation behind that. So far the discussion of hacking back in this manner has been discussed by lawyers, some shouting it is legal, and others saying it isn't. What they do agree on is that there's no case law, and until there is there will be no clear answer. Also, legalities vary from nation to nation, so the answer to legality is ""maybe"" and ""it depends where you are"". 

However so far none of the discussion I've seen has been among IT Security professionals who would be the ones to design, deploy, and run systems that would to the hacking back. The lawyers all seem to think that organizations would adopt the technique as a matter of course, but I am not in agreement with that and I would like to hear the views of my peers. This is why I've asked the question apart from legal and ethical aspects.

According to this question, a feature is a collection of stories.  One of the answers suggest that a feature is actually an epic.  

So are features and epics considered the same thing, which is basically a collection of related user stories?

Our project manager insists that there's a hierarchical structure:

Epic -> Features -> User stories

... basically all user stories must fall within this structure.  Therefore all user stories must fall under an umbrella feature and all features must fall under an epic.

To me, that sounds awkward.  Can someone please clarify how user stories, features, and epics are related?  Or is there an article that clearly outlines the differences?

However, I have no idea how to find the the multiplicity of the zeros at the origin. I'm really stuck.
",Luiz Meier,https://mathematica.stackexchange.com/users/10618,"General approach

If {x0, y0} is a root of a polynomial system {p1, p2} such that there is no other root of the form {x0, y1}, the multiplicity is given by the multiplicity of the zero x0 of the resultant

Resultant[p1, p2, y]


We can compute the multiplicity of this zero with

SparseArray[
   CoefficientList[Resultant[p1, p2, y] /. x -&gt; x0 + u, u]
 ][""NonzeroPositions""][[1, 1]] - 1


If a root {x0, y0} lines up with another root {x0, y1}, a linear transformation of the variables can always be found so that moves all the other roots off the line x = x0.  So in principle, this method can be applied to any system.

OP's example

In the OP's case, the command can be simplified a little since x0 == 0:

SparseArray[
   CoefficientList[Resultant[y^4 + 6 x^3*y + x^8, y^2 - x^3, y], x]
 ][""NonzeroPositions""][[1, 1]] - 1
(*
  6
*)


Comparison

I assume the OP wants a method, not just the answer.  (The OP's is simple enough to do, plug in x^3 for y, in one's head after all.)  We compare the NSolve method and @belisarius's Solve method with the Resultant method.

My original method was to use NSolve, which seems to work although the docs do not promise that it will, like this if we add Count as @belisarius did:

Count[NSolve[{p1 == 0, p2 == 0}, {x, y}], {x -&gt; 0.`, y -&gt; 0.`}]


Generalizing @belisarius's answer, I would get something like

Count[Solve[p1 == 0 /. #, x, Reals] &amp; /@ Solve[p2 == 0, y] // Flatten, x -&gt; 0]


which indeed yields 6 on the OP's example.

A more difficult example

Now let's consider the system with y^2 replacing y in the second polynomial:

p = {y^4 + 6 x^3*y + x^8, y^2 - x^3};


The two solve-based methods give different answers:

Count[NSolve[p == {0, 0}, {x, y}], {x -&gt; 0.`, y -&gt; 0.`}]
(* 9 *)

Count[Solve[p[[1]] == 0 /. #, x, Reals] &amp; /@ Solve[p[[2]] == 0, y] // Flatten, x -&gt; 0]
(* 10 *)


One solution gets counted twice in the Solve method, I guess, because the Resultant method yields

SparseArray[CoefficientList[Resultant[p[[1]], p[[2]], y], x]][""NonzeroPositions""][[1, 1]] - 1
(* 9 *)


Failure on repeated x0 - and the workaround

If we add some factors to the OP's system so that {x, y} = {0, 1} is a root, all the current solutions fail to yield 6:

p = {(y^4 + 6 x^3*y + x^8) (x^2 + (y - 1)^2), (y - x^3) (y - 1)};

Count[NSolve[p == {0, 0}, {x, y}], {x -&gt; 0.`, y -&gt; 0.`}]
(* 3 *)

Count[Solve[p[[1]] == 0 /. #, x, Reals] &amp; /@ Solve[p[[2]] == 0, y] // 
  Flatten, x -&gt; 0]
(* 8 *)

SparseArray[CoefficientList[Resultant[p[[1]], p[[2]], y], x]][""NonzeroPositions""][[1, 1]] - 1
(* 8 *)


Edit: Actually NSolve gets close, literally.  Numerical error leads to three of the roots being slightly off:

Count[Chop[NSolve[p == {0, 0}, {x, y}], 10^-50], {x -&gt; 0, y -&gt; 0}]
(* 6 *)


One can also use the Resultant method by transforming the coordinates so that the root {0, 1} is moved off the line x = 0:

With[{p = p /. {x -&gt; x + y, y -&gt; y}},
 SparseArray[CoefficientList[Resultant[p[[1]], p[[2]], y], x]][""NonzeroPositions""][[1, 1]] - 1]
(* 6 *)


Simply switching x and y also works in this case.



Orginal answer -- NSolve gives the correct multiplicity in V10

NSolve will return the multiplicity, which turns out to be 6 in this case:

NSolve[{y^4 + 6 x^3*y + x^8 == 0, y - x^3 == 0}, {x, y}, Reals]

1296,1296,2041,Mercedes SLK (R170) convertible top/trunk release,"I have a 1999 Mercedes SLK 230 (R170), with an interesting combination of problems:

A)  The hydraulics for the convertible top are low (to the point where the top won't even start to open anymore),

B)  The trunk latch is disconnected internally, so the trunk can't be opened.

If the top were still working, it can be opened partway to access the back of the trunk latch, and operate it manually...  or if the trunk would open, I'd have access to the manual release for the top.  But the combination of these two means I have no way to open either now.

So:  Are there any other tricks I can use in this situation?

One possible idea:  If I tear out the headliner (which I'd probably have to cut away, since the screws are only accessible with the top out), and disconnect the lines coming from the hydraulic pump, would this allow the top to move by hand?  This seems plausible, but I don't want to destroy my headliner on a hunch...  But, the only other idea I have at this point is drilling a hole behind the license plate to get to the latch, so I'm hoping to find another solution.

They were inexpensive because all you bought was the rubber part of the blade.  The steel strips to reinforce them were retained from the original wipers.

When my 2008 Nissan Frontier passenger wiper blade edge separated from the rest of the wiper I started looking for a replacement.  Refills I found claiming to be for my Frontier were usually refills for an after-market replacement arm assembly and did not fit my stock wipers.  I did finally find a Trico refill for my passenger side (18-240, narrow profile) but their recommended driver's side refill (24-240) is the same profile but needs to be wider (9mm vs 7mm??)

Local auto parts stores all say they stopped carrying OEM refills.  I could get a new wiper arm but years ago when I did that I regretted the poor quality of the replacement and the way it never quite fit the window as well.

5306,5306,8429,Best beginning programming language for someone interested in IT security,"Backstory:

At the moment I'm someone with very limited knowledge on computers and programming, but I would like to change that. I have discovered that I'm mainly interested in IT security and that I would especially like to learn more about that (not going to deny that Skyfall didn't have a part in this, but that's certainly not the main reason) as opposed to for example game/app development and such. I don't know exactly why, maybe it has something to do with the fact that I myself have been a victim of viruses and phising a couple of times.

Question itself:  

I have recently decided that I would like to learn my first programming language. This decision is seperate from my interest in IT security, but I would like my first language to be the language most useful for someone who wants to learn more about IT security. I feel this would be killing 2 birds with 1 stone. What would this language be and why?
",OmnipresentAbsence,https://security.stackexchange.com/users/20877,"To really understand IT security (and, more generally, computers), you will have to know how things go inside, so, sooner or later, you will have to learn assembly for one or two architectures (preferably more than two). The low-level exploit codes (e.g. for buffer overflows) don't make sense unless you know assembly. Then move on to C, which is very widespread and a usual target for such exploits. C is easy to learn if you know assembly. Once you know assembly and C, you can learn more complex languages (e.g. C# or Java); your understanding of the inner workings of the machine will guide you through the most ""magical looking"" features of such advanced languages. Following this path, you may then try scripting languages, where each language element hides an awful lot of computations.

This learning order, from low-level to high-level, is an ideal; I have yet to meet a single person who strictly adhered to it. In my own learning path, I started with Basic (""version 1.0"", from 1984) and then switched to assembly (on a 6809E CPU) because Basic was really too slow on my machine (a 1 MHz CPU does not have a lot of muscle). Later on, I learned Pascal, then C, and some more assembly. Afterwards, I did a lot of C, I touched many other languages (e.g. Caml, PostScript, Prolog, Objective-C, C++), some scripting (Unix sh, Perl...) and even more assembly (on several distinct architectures). Even later on, I did a lot of Java. Also tried Forth, Scheme, some more assembly. Lately, I have done some C# (which is very similar to Java), PowerShell, and suffered from an outbreak of VB.

What is to remember is that every language has its quirks; you will achieve the programming equivalent of enlightenment if you can see beyond the particularities of any specific language, and concentrate on the underlying algorithmics. Knowing a lot of languages and architectures will help you greatly. It will also highlight what language features are especially ""dangerous"" to use, by which I mean prone to trigger exploitable weaknesses. Conversely, if you stick to a single language, then you will only be a mediocre practitioner of programming and IT security.

Other learning paths exist and some people are happy with them. Many apprentice programmers begin with something high-level like Python and only later on try to see ""under the hood"" how the computer really does things. I tend to favour the low-to-high path because it is similar to the path that I followed myself, but there is no absolute necessity in that.

3177,3177,5062,Tool for automatically generating and laying out an entity relationship diagram?,"I've seen a lot of tools which can reverse engineer an ERD from an existing database, but I haven't been able to find one which is capable of automatically laying out the diagram in a reasonable way. Most of them just plop all the entities down on top of each other and call it a day. Some make an attempt at organizing the entities, but they don't do a very good job of it. 

Is there any tool out there that will reverse engineer the structure of an existing database, and then automatically lay it out in a way which is easy to understand and reveals the organization of the database? If I were to make such a tool, I'd have it minimize the length of lines connecting entities, minimize the number of lines which cross each other, and make groups of related entities stand out from each other. I'd also try to deduce which tables are lookup tables, which ones are mana-to-many intermediate tables, etc and lay out the entities such that these roles are obvious to a person looking at the diagram. 

I don't exactly have the funding to make the above, but I do have some funding to buy a tool like that if it's good. 

Edit: I should mention that I'm trying to diagram a database with 100+ tables, so I'd like to automate as much of it as possible.

Kosher salt is less soluble and less dense than table salt.

The large crystals in these salts mean that unless there is a fair bit of water present they don't completely dissolve. This means it is less likely you'll over salt steak even if it's caked in crystals.

Table salt will dissolve with far less water present and will, therefore, get absorbed more easily into the meat. 

Also the lower density means you can liberality sprinkle Kosher/Sea/Rock salt on things and even if it does all dissolve you've actualy added less salt than you would think. It looks like a lot but 1g of Kosher/Sea/Rock salt takes up a lot more space than 1g of table salt.

3367,3367,5374,How can I tell if a downloaded ISO is complete?,"I just ran into a nasty problem with an ISO download from Microsoft.  I successfully burnt it to a rewritable DVD, and copied the contents to the local hard drive on another machine, but when I went to run them they were corrupt.  It turns out the download had been truncated.

Now, OK, sometimes that happens - but it surprised me that the truncated file (which was only slightly more than 60% of the actual ISO) burnt successfully and seemed to be presenting me with a sensible file system, to the extent that I could (apparently) successfully copy the files.

So, is there some way I could have tested the file to see if it was complete or not?  The MS web site did not provide any information about the expected size, so I'm looking for a generic solution: given an ISO file which may or may not be truncated, is there some way to tell?  Do commonly used CD/DVD (data) formats include any embedded information about how much data is supposed to be on the disk, or even better, some kind of CRC?

A solution that detects most truncated images will be accepted, it doesn't need to be perfect.  (I'd prefer something that doesn't give false positives, though.)

[Addendum: a comparison of the disk burnt with the truncated image with the files extracted from the full image suggests that chunks of the data from many of the files were replaced with random information, perhaps from the contents of a previous burn to the same rewritable disk.]

This is a production database. If I shrink it will it cause downtime or lock the database?
In SQL Server Management Studio you have two options for shrink, database or files. Given my situation what would be the best option?
is there a rule on the percentage of free space a DB should have?


Even reading the tag description of shrink makes me not want to do it. Is there another way?
",jackncoke,https://dba.stackexchange.com/users/66232,"you have good reason to be concerned as DB shrinks in SQL Server often ""suck"".  Paul Randal, the head of the Storage Engine in SQL 2005 stated, ShrinkDB is written very poorly.  It will find empty space by taking the data at the very end and put it in the very beginning and keep doing this until it has free space at the 'end' of the DB files.  At this point it can then release the space from SQL Server and give it back to the OS.  You are effectively reversing your database files thus you will see massive fragmentation usually.  You can read about his views on this blog post or on this MCM Internals Video

As with everything, you really must test these in your environment first.  A better way of doing it is to move data to a different filegroup. You can do a online index rebuild with the clustered index and then reindex in the new filegroup.  Then you can drop the old one and release the space and have almost no fragmentation.  Note this will take about 120% extra space while it's working through it.  The problem with this is that you need even additional free space which it looks like you might not have.  This is an enterprise feature.

If free space is at that much of a premium, then you might have to bite the bullet and slowly shrink the DB a small chunk at a time to avoid long running processes.  Note that your data will be heavily fragmented and you will want to reindex everything again.  Note that after reindexing everything, you will then balloon up your used space a bit and go back to having additional free space.  See Brent's advice here.

As far as how much free space is good for you, is a matter of how much you can afford fragmentation and file growth activities.  With IFI enabled, the file growth is almost instant but you still get fragmentation.  A good rule of thumb is to preallocate as much as space as you think you'll need, or monitor the growth and adjust in chunks periodically if you have to.  This keeps physical fragmentation down.

Also log file growth is a lot more important.  Additional log files can cause VLF fragmentation.  This makes your restores a lot slower and can affect checkpoint/truncates.  Here's some performance risks you take with a fragmented log.  Do a DBCC LOGINFO(); on each database.  Try to keep the number around 50ish per Kim Tripp, but if you see hundreds, you have fragmentation issues which means your log files had to grow to support operations.  A good way to see what your log file should be per Paul Randal is to just let it grow for a week and reindex.  That could be a good point, perhaps you can throw a bit more free space on there just in case.  Make sure your logs are not fragmented with DBCC LOGINFO(); again and if they are, it means they grew a lot.  Shrink and re-expand the log file using this method.

I assume that this is some kind of difference between the awk that ships with OS X and mawk from Linux. Removing the string concatenation in the print gets the awk program to work on both platforms, but I would prefer to keep the prefix and surfix. How do I write an awk program that splits a file on a separator into multiple numbered parts and works on both platforms?

4520,4520,7162,"Is it safe to disable cache flushing on a SSD with ""power loss protection""?","I have an Intel 320 SSD which is supposedly able to flush its cache during a power loss.

From Storage Review:


  Rarely seen in a consumer SSD, Intel uses an array of capacitors to
  make sure data gets saved to the drive in the event of an unsafe
  shutdown as the result of power loss.


From Intel:


  The Intel SSD 320 Series contains hardware- and firmware-based
  power-loss data protection features. The SSD includes a power-fail
  detection circuit, which  sends a signal to the ASIC controller in the
  SSD indicating there is an imminent drop in power level. Triggered
  by this, SSD firmware disconnects the input power from the SSD.
  
  The SSD then relies on its on-board power-loss protection capacitance
  to provide enough energy for  the SSD firmware to move data from the
  transfer buffer and other temporary buffers to the NAND.


Does it mean I can safely turn off ""Windows write-cache buffer flushing""? My primary motivation is to improve performance, although I'm aware that this might not make a big change for desktop workload.

3322,3322,5302,Why did Voldemort assume that no-one knew about Room of Hidden Things?,"Voldemort hid one of his Horcruxes inside Hogwarts. It seemed to be relying on security through obscurity as far as protecting it. But as we know, it ended up not being so secure because it wasn't so obscure - Harry Potter knew about the Room of Hidden Things.

My question is, the way Rowling describes this hints at the fact that Riddle had an assumption that very few people would ever stumble upon that room. *WHY???



First, let's show Harry's theory on what Voldemort was thinking, how and why:

Here's Harry understanding Voldemort's thinking in HP7 once he figured out where the Diadem was (bold emphasis mine):


  Tom Riddle, who confided in no one and operated alone, might have been arrogant
  enough to assume that he, and only he, had penetrated the deepest mysteries of
  Hogwarts Castle. Of course, Dumbledore and Flitwick, those model pupils, had never
  set foot in that particular place, but he, Harry, had strayed off the beaten track in his
  time at school – here at least was a secret area he and Voldemort knew, that
  Dumbledore had never discovered –


...and later on, with Harry explains the location to Ron/Hermione:


  “He hid it exactly where I had my old Potions book, where everyone’s been hiding stuff for centuries. He thought he was the only one to find it. Come on.”
  
  “And he never realized anyone could get in?” said Ron, his voice echoing in the silence.
  “He thought he was the only one,” said Harry.


.



Yet, from available evidence, that seems to be a completely wrong assumption, even at Voldemort's time. 

Let's examine that last quote again, with emphasis on other info available:


  “He hid it exactly where I had my old Potions book, where everyone’s been hiding stuff for centuries.” ...
  
  ...
  
  “And he never realized anyone could get in?” said Ron, his voice echoing in the silence.
  “He thought he was the only one,” said Harry. “Too bad for him I’ve had to hide stuff in
  my time... this way,” he added. “I think it’s down here... “ 
  
  They sped off up adjacent aisles; Harry could hear the others’ footsteps echoing through the towering piles of junk, of bottles, hats, crates, chairs, books, weapons, broomsticks, bats...


.

OK, so if there's a truckload (or train-load, by the description) of stuff in that room, isn't the only reasonable conclusion: ""the room is a fairly popular destination with plenty of people who've found their way there in the past, and therefore, likely, plenty who will in the future""? 

Doesn't matter what your arrogance level is, the evidence seems to point to only one conclusion - it's quite fine as a place to temporarily bury your dirt so teachers won't tag you for your misdeeds, but this is NOT the place to hide something that you want permanently safe! 

So why did Voldemort make such a moronic mistake?
",DVK-on-Ahch-To,https://scifi.stackexchange.com/users/976,"It's the room of requirement. Voldemort required a room to hide his item in. Where better to hide a small, reasonably nondescript item than in a pile of junk? If not then it's possible when he hid it it wasn't full of junk; Harry required a room full of all of the small, nondescript items that may have been the diadem. Yes he knew what it was but maybe not specifically enough to single it out.

The room also has a habit of overdoing things, like when Dumbledore needs the loo and finds tens of chamberpots there, when one would do: 


  ""Only this morning, for instance, I took a wrong turning on the way to the bathroom and found myself in a beautifully proportioned room I have never seen before, containing a really rather magnificent collection of chamber pots. When I went back to investigate more closely, I discovered that the room had vanished. But I must keep an eye out for it. Possibly it is only accessible at five-thirty in the morning. Or it may only appear at the quarter moon - or when the seeker has an exceptionally full bladder.""

Downloads and installs updates for all installed packages - as long as it doesn't bother dependencies (install new packages, remove old ones or crosses a repo source (switch a package from one repo to another)).

where $a_{ij}\in\mathbb R$.

I would like to find a presentation of the group $\Gamma=G\cap\mathrm{GL}_n\mathbb Z$.

The entries on the superdiagonal play a crucial role, in that the $n-1$ matrices with a single $1$ on the superdiagonal ($1$s on the diagonal and $0$s elsewhere) generate all of $\Gamma$.

Trying to write down a presentation, I would start by choosing $n-1$ generators, $a_{12},\dotsc,a_{n-1,n}$ (named after the matrix entries). It is also clear that we need commutation relations, like
$$
[\cdots[[[a_{12},a_{23}],[a_{23},a_{34}]],\ldots]\cdots]=\cdots=e.
$$
(If $n=3$, this would just be $[[a_{12},a_{23}],a_{12}]=[[a_{12},a_{23}],a_{23}]=e$.)
I am just not sure, though, if I explicitly need to require that, say,
$$
[a_{12},a_{34}]=e,
$$
which seems to be directly related to the embedding I am thinking of. I would like a presentation in which any generators can be mapped to any of the matrices with a $1$ in the $(i,i+1)$ position. Is this possible?

3401,3401,5423,Mechanical Equivalent of Heat,"Recently I have been looking up James Joule's experiment regarding the mechanical equivalent of heat.  After viewing some drawings of the apparatus, I assumed that the lines holding the weights would have to be attached to the drum.  They would then be allowed to fall completely through a certain distance until the lines were at full length and the mechanical motion of the fluid would have to be allowed to continue to flow, causing the weights to be pulled up a bit and drop again, oscillating up and down until the motion stopped and all of the mechanical energy from the weights would be transferred into the fluid.

However, upon watching some videos, (this video is about 14 minutes long; but, if you advance to about 5 min 30 sec, it will show the experiment in question.) I noticed that the weights were allowed to be stopped by a level surface (an external force) instead of doing what I have described above.  To me, this means the weights were still in motion and, therefore, still had KE that was not transferred into the fluid.  

Of course, the weights are moving very slowly, much more slowly than if they had been allowed to free-fall through the distance; so, their kinetic energy is very small compared to the potential energy they lost, meaning the vast majority of the potential energy was transferred into the fluid and into other, small energy losses.

Should I assume the speeds of the weights were small enough to ignore the KE in the weights?

The assumption seems to be that the potential energy lost by the falling weights was all transferred into the fluid.  However, in the experiments, the lines have to be wound back up and the weights dropped several times in order to make a measurable difference in temperature.  Each time the weights fall, they are stopped by an external force, meaning they have kinetic energy that is not transferred into the fluid after falling through a measured distance.  It seems to me that some of the potential energy from the weights is transferred into the fluid; but, some of it is transferred into the kinetic energy of the weights falling.
",Michael E. Mall,https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/24443,"Watching the video$\, \!^{*}$ I'd estimate the relevant dropping height $h$ and dropping speed $v$ (close to reaching the ground, and probably nearly constant for much of the drop) conveniently at about

Thus

$W_{pot}/m = g ~ h \approx$ 10 m^2/s^2

[Additional remark: 
Joule himself would have easily been able to calculate and account for this,  of course (and likely he did); and more precisely, too, based on measuring values of $h$ and $v$ of his actual setup.]

3030,3030,4829,What creates this strange flare and how to prevent it?,"I shot at a concert for the first time. The pictures were pretty good for the capability of my equipment, but on some shots, the light has a very strange flare. It isn't the usual rays, but some soft, non-symmetric form which I find quite strange, and, on most shots, distracting. 



On this image, you can see it just above Gino's head and also behind his back, to the right of the mic stand. I am not sure if the slight blue lines on the left side of the picture (they form a triangle aimed at Chris's head, maybe not visible on all monitors) are part of the problem or if they come from a different light source. 

What makes them appear, and how do I avoid them? 

I shot with a D90 with a 18-200 lens, no filters or hoods attached. The settings were quite strained (iso 3200, often at max length and max aperture for the length. This specific picture is 1/125, f 5.3, 95 mm).

2292,2292,3652,What is the variance of a Polya Gamma distribution?,"I have a simple application that needs the variance of a Polya Gamma distribution (I know the mean since I found it here- http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.0310). 

This paper says that there is a closed form solution for the variance, but I am not really a mathematician and cannot calculate it.

In short, does anyone know the closed form solution for the variance of the Polya Gamma distribution.

I would be very grateful.
",Roland Baddeley,https://stats.stackexchange.com/users/60155,"In equation (6), the paper obtains the Laplace transform of these distributions as

$$\phi(t) = \prod_{k=1}^\infty \left(1 + \frac{t}{d_k}
\right)^{-b};\ d_k = 2\left(k-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 \pi^2 + c^2/2$$

where $b\gt 0$ and $c\in \mathbb R$ are the parameters.  Taking logarithms yields 

$$\psi(t) = \frac{d}{dt}\phi(t) = \sum_{k=1}^\infty -b \log\left(1 + \frac{t}{d_k}\right).$$

This is a cumulant generating function (for imaginary values of $t$, at any rate) whose Taylor series around $t=0$ begins

$$\psi(t) = -\mu_1^\prime t + \frac{1}{2!} \left( \mu_2^\prime - \mu_1^{\prime \,2} \right)t^2 + \cdots$$

with $\mu_j^\prime$ representing the raw moment of order $j$: thus, the negative of the coefficient of $t$ is the mean and twice ($=2!$) the coefficient of $t^2$ is the variance.  The summation formula for $\psi$ can be expanded term-by-term and collected in common powers of $t$ to produce

$$\psi(t) = \sum_{k=1}^\infty -b \left(\frac{t}{d_k} + \frac{t^2}{2 d_k^2} + \cdots\right) = -b\sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{d_k} t - b\sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{2d_k^2} t^2 + \cdots.$$

Such sums, whose terms are the reciprocals of quadratic (and higher) functions of the integral index $k$, are straightforward to evaluate using the Weierstrass Factorization Theorem and yield

$$\mu_1^\prime = \frac{b }{2 c}\tanh \left(c/2\right);\ \mu_2^\prime - \mu_1^{\prime\,2} = \frac{b }{4 c^3}(\sinh (c) - c) \text{sech}^2\left(c/2\right).$$

The former agrees with the mean reported in the paper (adding some confidence to the overall correctness of this approach) while the latter answers the question: it is a closed form expression for the variance.  (These series can be continued in higher powers of $t$ to develop closed formulas for any cumulants, from which higher moments can be extracted.)

Partial contour plots show that the signs of the results (at least) are correct.

$$\phi(t) = \prod_{k=1}^\infty \left(1 + \frac{t}{d_k}
\right)^{-b};\ d_k = 2\left(k-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 \pi^2 + c^2/2$$

where $b\gt 0$ and $c\in \mathbb R$ are the parameters.  Taking logarithms yields 

$$\psi(t) = \frac{d}{dt}\phi(t) = \sum_{k=1}^\infty -b \log\left(1 + \frac{t}{d_k}\right).$$

This is a cumulant generating function (for imaginary values of $t$, at any rate) whose Taylor series around $t=0$ begins

$$\psi(t) = -\mu_1^\prime t + \frac{1}{2!} \left( \mu_2^\prime - \mu_1^{\prime \,2} \right)t^2 + \cdots$$

with $\mu_j^\prime$ representing the raw moment of order $j$: thus, the negative of the coefficient of $t$ is the mean and twice ($=2!$) the coefficient of $t^2$ is the variance.  The summation formula for $\psi$ can be expanded term-by-term and collected in common powers of $t$ to produce

$$\psi(t) = \sum_{k=1}^\infty -b \left(\frac{t}{d_k} + \frac{t^2}{2 d_k^2} + \cdots\right) = -b\sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{d_k} t - b\sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{2d_k^2} t^2 + \cdots.$$

Such sums, whose terms are the reciprocals of quadratic (and higher) functions of the integral index $k$, are straightforward to evaluate using the Weierstrass Factorization Theorem and yield

$$\mu_1^\prime = \frac{b }{2 c}\tanh \left(c/2\right);\ \mu_2^\prime - \mu_1^{\prime\,2} = \frac{b }{4 c^3}(\sinh (c) - c) \text{sech}^2\left(c/2\right).$$

The former agrees with the mean reported in the paper (adding some confidence to the overall correctness of this approach) while the latter answers the question: it is a closed form expression for the variance.  (These series can be continued in higher powers of $t$ to develop closed formulas for any cumulants, from which higher moments can be extracted.)

Partial contour plots show that the signs of the results (at least) are correct.



Nothing is shown along the $b$ axis (where $c=0$) because these formulas are not defined for $c=0$.  However, the plots make it clear that the formulas can be extended to continuous functions along that axis by taking the limits as $c\to 0$.  They give $b/4$ for the mean and $b/24$ for the variance.

In Nautilis, when I click on ""Properties"" and select the ""Audio"" tab, it shows ""Year: Unknown"". In Rhythmbox, it does the same when selecting the file ""Properties"" and says it's ""Unknown"". When I use EasyTag though, it works fine and shows the Year field set properly. I've also tried using eyeD3 to try both ID3 v1.x, v2.3 and v2.4, but they all show ""Unknown"".

One other observation was when I changed the year from ""Unknown"" to ""2013"" in Rhythmbox, and then closed Rhythmbox, Nautilis still showed ""Unknown"" for the year.

Is there something more to setting the Year field on ID3 tags that I'm missing, or is this just some subtlety between how different programs interpret the tags?

The pictures were pretty good for the capability of my equipment, but on some shots, the light has a very strange flare. It isn't the usual rays, but some soft, non-symmetric form which I find quite strange, and, on most shots, distracting. 



On this image, you can see it just above Gino's head and also behind his back, to the right of the mic stand. I am not sure if the slight blue lines on the left side of the picture (they form a triangle aimed at Chris's head, maybe not visible on all monitors) are part of the problem or if they come from a different light source. 

What makes them appear, and how do I avoid them? 

I shot with a D90 with a 18-200 lens, no filters or hoods attached. The settings were quite strained (iso 3200, often at max length and max aperture for the length. This specific picture is 1/125, f 5.3, 95 mm).

You are misunderstanding it. The microwave is required to send the d-mail, not to receive it. 

Basically, the d-mail functions exactly as a normal text message that you would send to someone. The only difference (apart from the size limit) is that when you send a normal message, it will arrive in some time after being sent. The d-mail, on the contrary, will arrive in some time before being sent. It can be sent to any phone (or a pager), the only requirement is obviously that you need to know the phone number.

Does anyone have a hint on how to pass the alias through?

In this case, I have a bunch of options for perl when I'm debugging:

alias pd='perl -Ilib -I/home/myuser/lib -d'


Sometimes, I have to debug my tools as root, so, instead of running:

pd ./mytool --some params


I need to run it under sudo.  I've tried many ways:

sudo eval $(alias pd)\; pd ./mytool --some params
sudo $(alias pd)\; pd ./mytool --some params
sudo bash -c ""$(alias pd)\; pd ./mytool --some params""
sudo bash -c ""$(alias pd); pd ./mytool --some params""

sudo bash -c eval\ ""'$(alias pd)\; pd ./mytool --some params'""


I was hoping for a nice, concise way to ensure that my current pd alias was fully used (in case I need to tweak it later), though some of my attempts weren't concise at all.

I’m not a professional and I won’t need something very expensive in the first place and this seems like a good choice. My only experience with drawing until now was been pen and paper.

Did a short search on the forum and found couple of tips and advises about installing this thing. I guess I’ll try those when I’ll have the tablet in my hands. 
I just have a couple of questions before buying it:

For people who are using it with Ubuntu, would you recommend something else in this price range?. From my little google research there are pretty good reviews for this model but I’m open to suggestions.

Does anyone have a complete set of instructions for installing it(meaning something that will help me use all its features?

What app do you use for it, I have two or three apps that came with gnome but if there is something better you recommend I would like to hear about it?

3493,3493,5573,How can I build a switching circuit that scales several 12v signals down to <5v?,"Let me start off by saying that I know just enough about electronics to be dangerous (how to solder, follow a simple schematic, and check for connectivity problems and usually figure out what each wire is for).

I've installed a cruise control kit in my car, and I want to use a set of Honda steering wheel controls instead of the stock controls from the kit.  The cruise kit controls are expecting 12 volts, but I'm not comfortable running any more than 5 volts through the small steering wheel wires next to the airbag wiring.  I'd prefer even less, like 2-3 volts.

So I need to build a switching circuit that will provide the 12 volt signals to the cruise kit.  I was thinking of keeping it solid-state, since I don't know of any relays that will switch on 2-3 volts.  However, if there's a good reason to use relays then I can.

Here's a rough drawing of what I need:



How can I get started with this project?
",jnylen,https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/1610,"Airbag requires about 6V only to set it off, so setting 5V as your ceiling is probably pushing it, I think I remember it needed less than 200mA, so a fuse is actually a waste of time, if not a bad placebo. I only know this because I once helped build an airbag tester to be used for Volkswagen and BMW on the Uitenhage plant in South Africa, AND had to wait patiently while everyone still messed about with antistatic gear (which I thought was overkill, but I may be wrong). The trouble with relays or switches, is that they need to have a good bit of juice running through the contacts, else they do not make good contact (they are designed to actually arc, and in low current applications, a small ceramic is used to sometimes make a tiny spark to weld the contacts together). DC is also not that great, since the arc carries metal with it. 

So a transistor switching (boosting) circuit (which you have designed) is also getting my vote, you can use the transistors to drive a 12V relay (small one), ro regulators needed, and since car battery is 13.5V and the darlington-style circuit (which you drew) often looses just over a volt anyway. The voltage (and needed current) for the BASE of the darlington is going to be low enough to be safe. Just remember to place a diode across the relay coil for back EMF taking your transistors out.

5582,5582,8862,Mechanic says not to use top three/bottom two gears or the chain will throw,"I just bought a BTwin Fit 5, all stock, fresh from the distributor, Decathlon. Took it for light pacing at the store and things seemed OK. About 100 metres out the door, I shift up to the top end of the range, pedalling firmly but not hard, and it promptly throws the chain to the outside.

Returning to the store, the mechanic puts the chain back on, adjusts the tension on the derailleurs and tells me not to use the top three or bottom two gears (i.e., the 3 highest resistance and two lowest resistance shift positions in the drive train's range), or the chain will throw again. I asked why, but unfortunately, I'm a foreigner and don't speak the local language well enough to understand any of his explanation. Please note I definitely did not misunderstand the bit about not using the gears; this was crystal clear. 

Wild speculations on what he may have said about the reasons for this:


Chain tension or play due to the lateral shift between the inner and outer gears of the front and rear cassettes when shifting
Chain length
Something about the derailleurs


Again, there's a substantial language barrier and I have zero confidence in my understanding of what he said about why I shouldn't use those gears.

If you're not familiar with Decathlon, it's a sports department/box/super store. Definitely not a high end or dedicated bike shop. The house mechanic struck me as less than an expert, to put it gently. I've definitely read some reviews online griping about the inability of Decathlon staff to correctly set up the drive trains of new bikes. However, it's important to understand that this quality of expertise is representative of (or better than) that of every shop within an hour's travel.

This advice seems utterly mad to me. What on earth could be the reasoning behind this? What can I do about it? Aside from the obvious of taking it to a better mechanic, as that presents substantial difficulty for me on a number of fronts. The bike shifts without a problem, including before the throw. I did test out every gear during my test ride. I haven't yet experimented with trying to reproduce the problem yet; I'll do so in the next few days most likely.

The bike has a Shimano Sora groupset and Shimano Deore shifters. I'm an experienced rider but no mechanic; I haven't done anything beyond basic maintenance myself. I can provide additional pictures and am game to make relatively minor adjustments, but even just clearly nailing down the issue would be considerably useful.







Additional pictures, shifted to big-big.

2673,2673,4258,How does Charlie deduce Myra is Mrs Kieslowski?,"In Seven Psychopaths Charlie (Woody Harrelson) comes to the hospital to find Mrs Kieslowski. He finds a patient- who we know is Myra Kieslowski- but wrongly assumes that because she is black it cannot be her. He then tells her how he is looking for Mrs Kieslowski because her husband has stolen his dog.

In the course of the subsequent conversation, he comes to realise that she is the woman he's looking for. But I can't understand how.

Here's the discussion between Charlie and Moyra.


  Myra: I'm sure Mr. Kieslowski will take good care of your dog and get
  it back to you safe. He always seems like a sweet man when he comes
  in.
  
  Charlie: He come visit her a lot?
  
  Myra: Every day-
  
  Charlie: What kind of times every day?
  
  Myra: Different times, you know. And not every day. He misses a day
  now and then.
  
  Charlie: Oh. yeah? He been in today?
  
  Myra: Yeah. He came in earlier this morning, about 10:00 or so.
  
  Charlie: So the Polack married a n*gger, huh?


How did Charlie deduce this, from the conversation? 

Was it just the fact that Myra seemed too eager to convince him that Charlie had already missed Mr Kieslowski's visit and was wasting his time waiting? In which case, why did she say he visited every day? 
",Urbycoz,https://movies.stackexchange.com/users/4573,"The dialogue you cite actually comes after Myra sees Hans through her window and after she already talked a little bit with Charlie about Mrs Kieslowski. She was quite sure she could drag the whole situation out a bit, just playing her roommate and waiting what happens. But once she saw Hans walking to the hospital to visit her, she became increasingly nervous, knowing that Charlie was looking for him and the time ran short.

And nervous as she got, she suddenly brought the conversation to Mr. Kieslowski herself, which is where your quoted dialogue starts. And I think this is exactly the point where Charlie at least starts to get suspicious about her. I think this can be perceived in his behaviour, since after she said that, he suddenly starts to stop his little playing around with the wheelchair he sits in and turns around to look straight at her, getting nearer and nearer to her. And at this point he starts to interrogate her a bit more about Mr Kieslowski and his visiting times. Maybe he already guessed it at this point or he just had a suspicion. But it surely didn't help Myra that she got increasingly nervous and started beating around the bush with stuff like ""Different times, you know, not every day"" (after previously saying a pretty definite ""Every day"").

So to sum up, I would say at the point Myra brought the conversation to Mr Kieslowki (so at the start of your quoted dialogue section) Charlie definitely got suspicous about her and his supicion was manifested by her nervous behaviour during the further conversation. Maybe he even wasn't 100% sure before his ""n--ger"" comment. But he was at least sufficiently sure enough and Myra certainly didn't deny it.

2393,2393,3820,Unix C++: get time at a different zone,"I'm trying to get the time in a different timezone (PST) using C++.

In your original code, you have to worry about normalizing the time structure after changing the hour offset.  You can do that with the mktime() function.  Here's a program based on the function in the question, which is pure C and avoids the problems of returning a pointer to a local variable (and the #define ending with a semi-colon):

#include &lt;assert.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

    char t_buff[32];

    timeinfo = gmtime(&amp;rawtime);
    timeinfo-&gt;tm_hour = timeinfo-&gt;tm_hour + PST;

    time_t pst_time = mktime(timeinfo);
    assert(pst_time != (time_t)-1);
    int len = strftime(t_buff, sizeof(t_buff), ""%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"", timeinfo);

Clearly, a better interface would pass the UTC time value and the time zone offset (in hours and minutes) as arguments.  Despite the fact that my computer runs in US/Pacific (or America/Los_Angeles) time zone by default, I tested with TZ set to various values (including US/Eastern, IST-05:30) and got the correct values out; I'm reasonably convinced based on past experience that the calculation is correct.

I have another program that attempts to dissect whether the -1 returned from mktime() is because of an error or because the converted time corresponds to (time_t)-1:

2982,2982,4749,Mechanic Troubles And A Small Watery Oil Leak,"My car is a 2005 BMW 525i E60 with about 180,000km on the clock. It has been well looked after and serviced. I don't get dealer services, but go to a mechanic who has always been good and uses the same oils and genuine parts that BMW use. He used to be a BMW tech for about 25 years before going out on his own and is considerably cheaper.

Before we proceed, I apologise for the long story and hope you can bear with me. Make yourself a tea or coffee before you read this. I greatly appreciate any help anyone has to offer.

The story begins about 2 weeks ago when I took my car to the mechanic for a service. I was experiencing issues where the car was sluggy and I had an oil leak, simple enough I thought.

The mechanic called me and said they discovered a couple of inches of the fuel line beneath the car had been crushed (the hose is metal bent at weird angles and whatnot) and brake lines had also been squashed basically flat. The lines were squashed by a loose chunk of concrete coming off of a driveway. They called BMW and they were quoted $1300 AUD and a 3 week wait as the lines had to come from Germany.

They phoned around and were able to find second hand lines for about $400. They fitted the new lines and discovered the source of the leak was actually the oil filter, at first they thought the mount was cracked, but the car just needed a new oil filter. They also discovered a faulty part (a thermostat they had only replaced not even a year ago) still under warranty that they replaced. An engine mount near the alternator was also replaced, I recall they mentioned having to remove the alternator and whatnot to get to it.

After spending $2200 AUD on the repairs (a little more than I was expecting), I picked the car up and for a day it was perfect. It had a new-found sense of performance, was smoother than ever. Then the second day rolled around and my fiance calls me to tell me the car was blowing white smoke.

She picked me up and the car would pour out copious amounts of white smoke when taking off from lights, going up hills, etc. It wasn't a small amount either, it was literally clouds. It didn't have a sweet smell, more of a fume smell. The car was also idling rough and driving pretty rough as well, wasn't overly lacking power though.

I know what you are thinking and yes, it was my first thought too: the head gasket is blown and coolant and oil were mixing together. I had a sinking feeling in my stomach.

After the car had cooled down, I checked the oil and coolant. The oil was pretty much empty, it was below the minimum mark and the coolant was also a quarter down. Looking at the mechanic invoice it said they used about 6 litres of synthetic oil, where did it go I wondered. I checked the coolant and it was clean, I checked the oil and it was clean. I've seen what a blown head gasket looks like this wasn't looking the case. The oil had vanished, and some of the coolant as well, but it didn't appear as though the two were mixing.

Every time the car was started from a stationery position, it would blow lots of white smoke as it did when the car was being driven. Moisture getting into the engine somewhere seemed to be the most likely cause.

Because it was a late Friday evening and the mechanic workshop wasn't open until Monday, I decided to carefully fill the oil and coolant back up, I had some demineralised water and I also had some synthetic motor oil on hand. I filled the oil to just a little below the minimum mark and the coolant back to the full mark. I would call the mechanic on Monday and do some observational testing over the weekend.

As soon as I topped up both fluids, I started the car and no white smoke. I let it run for about 15 minutes. I turned it off, checked fluids and they were still full. The oil still appeared to be clean. I drove the car around the block and the white smoke was still gone. This was a good sign, but also a sign perhaps they forgot to top up the oil they charged me for, had it done damage I wondered?

The next morning I started the car and a puff of white smoke emerged and then cleared. Driving it however seemed to pose no problem, the white smoke would only appear after the car had been turned off and sitting for quite a while and first started. I checked the fluids and the oil was fine, the coolant had gone down a really tiny bit. Because I always park my car on a drip tray I noticed there was a water like oil substance on the tray, it wasn't a large amount, but enough to make me take notice. The oil had not gone down which made it all the more weird, where was the oil like colour and substance coming from?

Sunday rolled around the subsequently the same thing. No oil loss, coolant had gone down a bit more, white smoke on initial start after sitting and then cleared. I was hopeful when I took it to the mechanic on Monday it would be resolved.

I took it to the mechanic finally, I told them how the oil was empty and I topped it up, I also explained the coolant loss and they got me to start the car. Because the cloud of white smoke only happens on start, they couldn't see it. They said they could see a tiny bit of exhaust smoke and then subsequently tried telling me because of the age of the car (it's a 2005) that it was most likely the valve stem seals.

They then sold me a bottle of what looked like water which they poured into the oil for softening up the valve stem seals and said to keep an eye on it. They said if I notice any troubles, to bring it back. I stupidly went along with it even after explaining the oil loss and coolant loss. They offered no possible explanation as to why the oil was empty, I assumed it wasn't topped up. 

All of these issues are new ones I didn't have before I took the car to them, why would the valve stem seals all of a sudden cause me an issue after coincidentally getting it looked over and work done?

A couple of days had passed and the white smoke issue had temporarily disappeared and I thought, oh, maybe they were right. Then I noticed the smoke had returned again on start, I checked the fluids again and the oil was clean and fine. There were no signs of oil in the coolant or coolant in the oil. I however had noticed the coolant had dropped to about the half way mark now and the watery like oil was still leaking onto the drip tray.

I called them up and they said to bring it back down, I was determined to get them to actually look at the car this time. It was raining and I parked in the car park. The mechanic dude came out and I explained the situation. He offered no possible explanation for the coolant loss. It was also coincidentally raining and has been for the past few days. He said the water from the rain would have washed whatever was leaking from underneath and to bring it back when it's not raining.

What is going on here? What are my rights? I feel so helpless and trapped at the moment. I feel as though they're trying to avoid looking at the car properly maybe because they know they're responsible and scared maybe they blew the head gasket which is an expensive job.

What should I say to them next time I see them to make sure it gets fixed and looked at without incurring cost upon myself? I know it's hard, but what are some potential issues that could be responsible for my symptoms? Coolant loss, not going into the oil and oil not going down.

1328,1328,2093,What does it mean to interpret the Bible literally?,"Here are some common definitions from a dictionary for ‘literal’:


Being in accordance with, conforming to, or upholding the exact or primary meaning of a word or words.
Word for word; verbatim: a literal translation.
Avoiding exaggeration, metaphor, or embellishment; factual; prosaic: a literal description; a literal mind.


So what does it mean then to ‘take the Bible literally?’ Which definition are we referring to when we say ‘I take the Bible literally?’
",Mike,https://christianity.stackexchange.com/users/1743,"The easiest example is that of Creation, the very first part of the Bible presented as historical fact. Some believe that the Creation story is more of a myth or legend, and never really happened. Some, on the other hand, will say that the word ""days"" used there doesn't mean ""days"", but rather refers to spans of thousands or millions of years, during which time the earth was actually evolving, not being created as the Bible says.

A literal interpreter, on the other hand, will take the story at face value, believing that in seven days (that is, periods of 24 hours), God made the earth and all that is in it. They won't believe that he used some sped-up evolution.  They will interpret ""created"" to mean that out of nothing, God made something just by speaking it in to being.

Some believe that the Creation story is more of a myth or legend, and never really happened. Some, on the other hand, will say that the word ""days"" used there doesn't mean ""days"", but rather refers to spans of thousands or millions of years, during which time the earth was actually evolving, not being created as the Bible says.

A literal interpreter, on the other hand, will take the story at face value, believing that in seven days (that is, periods of 24 hours), God made the earth and all that is in it. They won't believe that he used some sped-up evolution.  They will interpret ""created"" to mean that out of nothing, God made something just by speaking it in to being. That is a literal interpretation.

1561,1561,2449,"Any connection between akimbo, askance and atremble?","I came across akimbo and askance today and wondered if they were related, with the opening 'a' signifying something. Apparently not:


Akimbo — to stand ""with hands on hips and elbows projecting outwards"", from the C15 in kenebowe, ""literally: in keen bow, that is, in a sharp curve""
Askance — to look sideways, obliquely, especially with suspicion or doubt; origin obscure.


Other words take an 'a' prefix meaning a negative:





  a- or an- [Greek a- and an- un-, non-] 
  Negative, not (abiotic,
  acaulescent, acephalia, aphasia, asexual, atrophy, anorexia).
  
  But 'a' is also used as a prefix in words that are not negative, for example his knees were all atremble. What is the meaning of 'a-' here? Could it have connections with akimbo and askance?

",Mynamite,https://english.stackexchange.com/users/33153,"This is actually a matter of general reference that should be easily explained by consulting any dictionary worthy of being called such — and certainly can be found in The Dictionary, if one would but look.

But I will explain it anyway. :)

English has at least 6 different prefixes, a-. This, however, is not one of those six.  Rather, the one you see in knees all a-tremble is actually an old preposition that we no longer use, just as it is in here we come a-wassailing, in nine lords a leaping,  and in twice a day.  

It was a variant of the preposition on that lost its -n.  The OED explains in a prep. (which is just the 8th entry in the Dictionary):


  Variant of on prep. with loss of the final consonant -n, reflecting an unstressed pronunciation of the word in proclitic use; compare an, variant of on prep., and also o, variant of on prep.  Compare a- prefix3, away adv., aright adv.
  
  The loss of final -n  in this word occurs early in terms of the developments described at N n.  and perhaps began in fixed idioms where the word was felt to be almost a prefix; compare the parallel development represented by a- prefix3. A following consonant favoured the loss of final -n  (compare discussion at N n.) and so until the 17th cent. the word was often found in complementary distribution with an, variant of on prep., which was common before vowels (with variation between the two before following h-).
  
  The separate preposition a ceased to be used in standard English after about 1700, being replaced by the full on, in, or the various prepositions which represent them in modern idiom, surviving only in a few set uses from branch  II., such as to go a begging, to set a going  (occasionally, before a vowel or h-, in form an, after an, prevocalic variant of a adj.; compare quots. 1759, 1780 at sense 11b), and in temporal distributive phrases, as twice a day, once a year, where it had been early identified with the indefinite article (see a adj.4). It also survived in a large number of combinations, where it was treated as a prefix to the governed word, and the whole as a compound adverb. 


As I said, it’s in the Dictionary.

Were you to look there, you would also see that although there is some connection between askew and askance, and several other, less common words besides, the actual origin is obscure.  The Dictionary says of askance adv.2:


  There is a whole group of words of more or less obscure origin in ask-, containing askance, askant, askew, askie, askile, askoye, askoyne, (with which compare asklent adv., aslant adv., asquint adv.,) which are more or less closely connected in sense, and seem to have influenced one another in form. They appear mostly in the 16th or end of the 15th cent., and none of them can be certainly traced up to Old English; though they can nearly all be paralleled by words in various languages, evidence is wanting as to their actual origin and their relations to one another.

5501,5501,8729,Was there confirmed opposition to Willow's relationship in Buffy season 5?,"In season five of Buffy the Vampire Slayer 


   Tara and Willow pursue a romantic relationship


There's lots of hugging and smiling and talking about their feelings, but up to the sixth episode, they do not kiss.  Was there studio/PR/political objection to the nature of this relationship?  How much?  What was the nature of it- was it deemed too controversial, inappropriate for younger viewers, were executives worried that it would perform poorly? 
",Adele C,https://scifi.stackexchange.com/users/3576,"According to The Strange And Incredible Saga Of Willow and Tara On ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"", there was initially at least some backlash from some fans about the relationship.


  The storyline received a great deal of attention in the press and sparked a controversy that divided the show’s most loyal fan base. In fact, Amber Benson who played Tara experienced first hand just how nasty the fans could get. She would visit the Buffy posting boards on the web on a regular basis and discover that negative comments were not only being made about the Willow/Tara relationship in general, but that the fans were targeting both the character of Tara as well as Amber Benson herself. “It was just so surreal to have people using my name and Tara’s name interchangeably and saying nasty things about both,” she said in the October 2000 issue of the English Science Fiction/horror magazine Dreamwatch. Benson also went on to say in the interview that ” it hurt for people to make nasty comments about Willow and Tara’s relationship and about my weight and what I looked like as a whole. Whether someone says that your ugly to your face or on a posting board, it still hurts horribly. I mean, you wouldn’t just go over to Joe Blow and say, ‘I think you’re a fat, ugly sexual pervert.” Almost immediately websites showing their support for Benson began popping up all over the web . “I have gotten so many supportive letters from fans,” Benson said. They have been so kind, she said. “they make me feel better about everything , especially when they share their experiences. They make me realize that I am not alone. We are all beautiful no matter what we look like on the outside.”


The article also goes on to explain why there was no on-screen kiss between Willow and Tara until season 6.


  Hannigan also went on to talk in the interview about how the WB network would not allow an onscreen kiss between the two actresses ” In America we’ve not been allowed to have the kiss on screen. As actors, we sometimes get the squished down version of reactions, so it could be that The Powers That Be are freaking, but to us it doesn’t seem like a big deal. The show goes out at 8:00 p.m., the first hour of prime time. If it went out at 9:00 p.m., we could probably show a kiss, but why bother ? I don’t think we need to see it. It’s just the annoying fact that we see Buffy and Riley having full--- on sex all day and all night (in Where The Wild Things Are.), but these two girls can’t even kiss ?”


The show moved from the WB to UPN after season 5, so apparently that network was a little bit more progressive-minded about the relationship.

Knots and holes do affect the strength of a joist but the three most important factors are: the dimensions of the lumber, the location of the hole, and the size of the hole. Best-case scenario is that you have a hole just big enough for the purpose needed, directly in the center of the joist. Worst-case scenario is that you have a hole that is too large and is located at the bottom of the beam (the tension face). As the article points out, a 1/2 inch hole in the tension face of a 2x10 joist can reduce the bending strength of the joist by as much as 9 percent!

3889,3889,6195,PostgreSQL bytea vs smallint[],"I'm looking to import large (100Mb -- 1 GB) multi-channel time-series data into a PostgreSQL database. The data comes from EDF format files that chunks the data into ""records"" or ""epochs"" of typically a few seconds each. Each epoch's record holds the signals for each channel of data as sequential arrays of short integers.

I'm mandated to store the files within the database, in the worst case as BLOBs. Given that, I'd like to investigate options that would allow me to do something more with the data within the database, such as facilitating queries based upon the signal data.

My initial plan is to store the data as one row per epoch record. What I'm trying to weigh up is whether to store the actual signal data as bytea or smallint[] (or even smallint[][]) types. Could anyone recommend one over the other? I'm interested in storage and access costs. Usage is likely to be insert once, read occasionally, update never. If one were more easily wrapped up as a custom type such that I could add functions for analysing of comparing records then so much the better.

No doubt I'm low on detail, so feel free to add comments on what you'd like me to clarify.
",beldaz,https://dba.stackexchange.com/users/13111,"In the absence of any answers I've explored the issue further myself.

It looks like user-defined functions can handle all base types, including bytea and smallint[], so this doesn't affect the choice of representation much.

I tried out several different representations on a PostgreSQL 9.4 server running locally on a Windows 7 laptop with a vanilla configuration. The relations to store that actual signal data were as follows.

Large Object for entire file

CREATE TABLE BlobFile (
    eeg_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    eeg_oid OID NOT NULL
);


SMALLINT array per channel

CREATE TABLE EpochChannelArray (
    eeg_id INT NOT NULL,
    epoch INT NOT NULL,
    channel INT,
    signal SMALLINT[] NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (eeg_id, epoch, channel)
);


BYTEA per channel in each epoch

CREATE TABLE EpochChannelBytea (
    eeg_id INT NOT NULL,
    epoch INT NOT NULL,
    channel INT,
    signal BYTEA NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (eeg_id, epoch, channel)
);


SMALLINT 2D array per epoch

CREATE TABLE EpochArray (
    eeg_id INT NOT NULL,
    epoch INT NOT NULL,
    signals SMALLINT[][] NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (eeg_id, epoch)
);


BYTEA array per epoch

CREATE TABLE EpochBytea (
    eeg_id INT NOT NULL,
    epoch INT NOT NULL,
    signals BYTEA NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (eeg_id, epoch)
);


I then imported a selection of EDF files into each of these relations via Java JDBC and compared the growth in database size after each upload. 

The files were:


File A: 2706 epochs of 16 channels, each channel 1024 samples (16385

File B: 11897 epochs of 18 channels, each channel 1024 samples (18432 samples per epoch), 418 MB
File C: 11746 epochs of 20 channels, each channel 64 to 1024 samples (17088 samples per epoch), 382 MB


In terms of storage cost, here's the size occupied in MB for each case:


Relative to the original file size, Large Objects were about 30-35% larger. By contrast, storing each epoch as either a BYTEA or SMALLINT[][] was less than 10% larger. Storing each channel as a separate tuple give a 40% increase, as either BYTEA or SMALLINT[], so not much worse than storing as a large object.

One thing I hadn't initially appreciated is that ""Multidimensional arrays must have matching extents for each dimension"" in PostgreSQL. This means that the SMALLINT[][] representation only works when all channels in an epoch have the same number of samples. Hence File C fails to work with the EpochArray relation.

In terms as access costs, I haven't played around with this, but at least in terms of inserting the data initially the fastest representation was EpochBytea and BlobFile, with EpochChannelArray the slowest, taking about 3 times as long as the first two.

The data comes from files in EDF format that divide the data into ""records"" or ""periods,"" typically a few seconds each. The record of each epoch saves the signal of each data channel as a sequence array of short integers.","In the absence of any answers I've explored the issue further myself.

It looks like user-defined functions can handle all base types, including bytea and smallint[], so this doesn't affect the choice of representation much.

I tried out several different representations on a PostgreSQL 9.4 server running locally on a Windows 7 laptop with a vanilla configuration. The relations to store that actual signal data were as follows.

Large Object for entire file

CREATE TABLE BlobFile (
    eeg_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    eeg_oid OID NOT NULL
);


SMALLINT array per channel

CREATE TABLE EpochChannelArray (
    eeg_id INT NOT NULL,
    epoch INT NOT NULL,
    channel INT,
    signal SMALLINT[] NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (eeg_id, epoch, channel)
);


BYTEA per channel in each epoch

CREATE TABLE EpochChannelBytea (
    eeg_id INT NOT NULL,
    epoch INT NOT NULL,
    channel INT,
    signal BYTEA NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (eeg_id, epoch, channel)
);


SMALLINT 2D array per epoch

CREATE TABLE EpochArray (
    eeg_id INT NOT NULL,
    epoch INT NOT NULL,
    signals SMALLINT[][] NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (eeg_id, epoch)
);


BYTEA array per epoch

CREATE TABLE EpochBytea (
    eeg_id INT NOT NULL,
    epoch INT NOT NULL,
    signals BYTEA NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (eeg_id, epoch)
);


I then imported a selection of EDF files into each of these relations via Java JDBC and compared the growth in database size after each upload. 

The files were:


File A: 2706 epochs of 16 channels, each channel 1024 samples (16385
samples per epoch), 85 MB
File B: 11897 epochs of 18 channels, each channel 1024 samples (18432 samples per epoch), 418 MB
File C: 11746 epochs of 20 channels, each channel 64 to 1024 samples (17088 samples per epoch), 382 MB

",Thijser,https://robotics.stackexchange.com/users/7226,"I experimented a bit and here's what I think happens.

When you run

$ rostopic echo /questions


The /questions topic doesn't exist before you run the program. Maybe you cheat it by first running your programming, running this command and then running your program again, but this assertion is still true. So at the point when you run your program, rostopic is not subscribed to any topic.

I don't know internally how this is handled by roscore and rostopic, but somewhere along the line, this is what's happening as the observed behavior of rostopic:

forever

    /* establish connection */
    while not subscribed to topic
        try to subscribe
        if failed
            sleep a bit

    /* intercept messages */
    while topic still exists
        wait for message
        print message


This means that rostopic (or more likely roscore on its behalf) waits for a topic to become available and subscribes to it.  It then proceeds to print incoming messages.  If the topic becomes unavailable, rostopic (or again more likely roscore on its behalf) goes back to waiting for the topic to become available again.

That said, here's what happens when this runs in parallel with your code:

    rostopic                       you

  wait for topic
      sleep







  wait for topic
      sleep

                                  start
                                ros::init
                             advertise topic
                          publish first message


subscribe to topic
 wait for message
      sleep


As you can see, your program publishes its first message immediately after advertising the topic. The unsuspecting rostopic program is not yet aware of this advertisement so is not actually subscribed to the topic yet. You publish the first message before rostopic gets a chance to subscribe to the topic.

You can verify this simply by putting a relatively large sleep after you advertise the topics and before you publish to them, i.e. between nc.init() and nc.spin().



To address your real problem (as stated and responded in the comments), which is to understand when the node has started up and use this as a trigger for further actions, I'd advise to consider another strategy.

Generally, you would want to make sure a node is up to make sure the other nodes that depend on it can run correctly. However, this doesn't mean that the original node has to be run just before the depending nodes. It could in theory be run long before them, or since ROS doesn't run in real-time and as you have observed, the timing between when topics are advertised, subscribed and the messages going around are quite unpredictable. Add network to this and they are really unpredictable.

So instead, you could devise a mechanism to query whether your node is available or not. This is simply done with a ROS service. You would essentially do all the necessary startup and then put up a service that always returns true. Any node that needs to ensure this node is available before proceeding can poll this service and as soon as a call to this service succeeds, you know the node is running.

As an added bonus, this means that you don't have to take this node down (and all depending nodes) just because you need to restart one of the depending nodes.

3294,3294,5254,How can I tell if a downloaded ISO is complete?,"I just ran into a nasty problem with an ISO download from Microsoft.  I successfully burnt it to a rewritable DVD, and copied the contents to the local hard drive on another machine, but when I went to run them they were corrupt.  It turns out the download had been truncated.

Now, OK, sometimes that happens - but it surprised me that the truncated file (which was only slightly more than 60% of the actual ISO) burnt successfully and seemed to be presenting me with a sensible file system, to the extent that I could (apparently) successfully copy the files.

So, is there some way I could have tested the file to see if it was complete or not?  The MS web site did not provide any information about the expected size, so I'm looking for a generic solution: given an ISO file which may or may not be truncated, is there some way to tell?  Do commonly used CD/DVD (data) formats include any embedded information about how much data is supposed to be on the disk, or even better, some kind of CRC?

A solution that detects most truncated images will be accepted, it doesn't need to be perfect.  (I'd prefer something that doesn't give false positives, though.)

[Addendum: a comparison of the disk burnt with the truncated image with the files extracted from the full image suggests that chunks of the data from many of the files were replaced with random information, perhaps from the contents of a previous burn to the same rewritable disk.]

3119,3119,4969,Another instructor is pushing me out of the classroom right after my class ends,"I am a graduate student in math in my final year, and for several years have been teaching at my department as a lecturer. This semester, in the same lecture hall there is another lecture that starts 20 minutes after my class ends. It's taught by another instructor from my department. I usually have many students coming to office hours and there are also students asking questions immediately after lecture. Due to other activities, I cannot have office hours right after the lecture this semester and can only stay for about 15 minutes to answer questions.

Many times in the past I had a similar situation and never had any issues with it. This semester the instructor who is teaching right after often arrives 20-15 minutes before her class starts and tells me immediately that I have to go with my students somewhere else. 

I make sure to leave the blackboard clean and take all my stuff away from the instructor's desk before she arrives, but I do believe that I have a right to stay in the classroom after my lecture for at least 5-10 minutes. There is no vacant classroom around, and I don't have time to go with students to my office, which is in a different building.

Last time the instructor told me in front of my students that I don't understand ""simple things"" and that I am ""playing games"". When I was talking to one of my students, she stood very close to us and clearly demonstrated that she wanted us out. I tried to explain her that I couldn't go anywhere else due to my time constraints, but she didn't want to listen to me. I really don't understand what ""simple"" things she meant and what ""games"" I am playing. 

We leave the board clean. She doesn't need to set up a projector. She can still talk to her students before her class starts, if she wants to (even though it seems like her students don't ask her any questions before their class). So, I don't see how I cause any disruption. 

I had met this woman many times before this semester, but we never talked. I didn't see her talking to other instructors/students much, and she seems to be quite reserved and a bit neurotic. She doesn't want to have any conversation with me regarding the issue.

I felt really offended after last class when she said those things to me in front of my students. What would you do in my case? 

Added later: There are no official rules regarding classroom occupancy between classes. Instructors are supposed to use common sense and be reasonable. For me using 50% of the break time seems reasonable to answer questions after lecture seems reasonable. I agree that for some people it may not.

I don't block the entrance to the classroom. A few students from the next class who come earlier always go ahead and take their seats as soon as my students start leaving the room. I also had one of the students from the next class listening to my explanation to one of those after-class questions and asking me further questions before their class (which is the same class as I am teaching, just a different section). Maybe the instructor got jealous, I don't know.

The entrance to the classroom is from its front (not back), so I do stay in the front. But it is a big lecture hall, and there is a plenty of space in front of the room (the board itself consists of 8 huge panels).

Also, during my career as a grad.student who is also teaching for the department, I have had several observations from experienced professors who are considered to be great teachers at the department and are in charge of undergraduate teaching policy. In my evaluations the fact that there are always several students approaching me with questions after class considered as very positive, meaning that students find me approachable. 

Thank you everyone for answers.

You find you can support your students better by providing some time at the end of class, which they already attend, to support them rather than expecting them to schedule time out of their day to visit you during normal office hours.

744,744,1179,Why is a precoder necessary for DQPSK and what does it accomplish?,"I've implemented a soft-decoder for DQPSK using the wonderful answers I received here:

How to soft decode DQPSK?

To get the soft-decoder working properly I needed to precode the data I was sending out.  I implemented the precoder mentioned in this paper:

$I_k=\overline{u_k \oplus v_k}*(u_k \oplus I_{k-1})+(u_k \oplus v_k)*(v_k \oplus Q_{k-1})$
$Q_k=\overline{u_k \oplus v_k}*(v_k \oplus Q_{k-1})+(u_k \oplus v_k)*(u_k \oplus I_{k-1})$

I'd like to know why this precoder is necessary -- what does that complicated expression of XORs actually accomplish?  

Here's a table showing what the equation yields.  If ""to_encode"" is 00, the to_send symbol is the same as the previous (""prev"") symbol.  If the ""to_encode"" is 11, the to_send symbol is the previous symbol xor 11.  What is the meaning in other cases?

For example the line [ 1 0 ] [ 0 1 ] [ 1 1 ] in the question says that to encode $3 = $ [1 0]  when the previous symbol was $1 = $ [0 1], we send $1-3 = -2 \equiv 2 \bmod 4$ where $2 =$ [1 1].
As stated in the answers and comments
on the previous question, 


  Differential encoding for QPSK is not the same as differential 
  (binary) encoding of the I and Q bit streams separately.


So the precoding scheme is just differential encoding for QPSK.
As to why it is included in the system, it must be that the
channel characteristics and system requirements are such that 
coherent detection of the signal is not thought to be feasible, 
and so the receiver is being implemented 
is a differentially coherent detector for DQPSK (differentially encoded 
QPSK).  Note that coherent detection requires that the receiver
phase lock loop acquire (and track) the incoming carrier in 
both frequency and phase (including resolution of
the four-fold phase ambiguity) while for differentially coherent
detection, frequency acquisition and tracking suffices, so that
the receiver is simpler and more robust, though of course 
for a given SNR, the BER of the differentially coherent
receiver is higher than the BER of the coherent receiver.

For example the line [ 1 0 ] [ 0 1 ] [ 1 1 ] in the question says that to encode $3 = $ [1 0]  when the previous symbol was $1 = $ [0 1], we send $1-3 = -2 \equiv 2 \bmod 4$ where $2 =$ [1 1].
As stated in the answers and comments
on the previous question, 


  Differential encoding for QPSK is not the same as differential 
  (binary) encoding of the I and Q bit streams separately.


So the precoding scheme is just differential encoding for QPSK.
As to why it is included in the system, it must be that the
channel characteristics and system requirements are such that 
coherent detection of the signal is not thought to be feasible, 
and so the receiver is being implemented 
is a differentially coherent detector for DQPSK (differentially encoded 
QPSK).  Note that coherent detection requires that the receiver
phase lock loop acquire (and track) the incoming carrier in 
both frequency and phase (including resolution of
the four-fold phase ambiguity) while for differentially coherent
detection, frequency acquisition and tracking suffices, so that
the receiver is simpler and more robust, though of course 
for a given SNR, the BER of the differentially coherent
receiver is higher than the BER of the coherent receiver.

3990,3990,6368,How is the energy/eigenvalue gap plot drawn for adiabatic quantum computation?,"I was going through arXiv:quant-ph/0001106v1, the first paper by Farhi on adiabatic quantum computation.
 Equation 2.24 says, $$\tilde{H}(s) = (1-s)H_B + sH_P$$ which means the adiabatic evolution starts from the ground state of $H_B$ and slowly evolves until it arrives at the ground state of $H_P$. In section 3.1, the one qubit example has the adiabatic Hamiltonian as $$\tilde{H}(s) = \begin{pmatrix}
s &amp; \epsilon (1-s) \\ 
\epsilon (1-s) &amp; 1-s   
\end{pmatrix}$$
I don't see how the plot of Figure 1 is drawn. In figure 1, Farhi plotted eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian for s while the range for s was 0 to 1. The Hamiltonian is supposed to evolve according to the Schrodinger equation (eq 2.1), $$i \frac{d}{dt} |\Psi (t) \rangle = H(t) |\Psi (t) \rangle$$
Was this evolution solved to draw the plot? Or did Farhi derive the formula for eigenvalues in terms of s using just matrix math and plotted accordingly?
",Omar Shehab,https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/15688,"The latter. The reason is because it doesn't make a lot of sense to do the eigendecomposition of an approximated Hamiltonian, which is what you're doing when solving for the dynamics (your operator probably won't be Hermitian so your energies won't even be real). Doing the evolution gives you the final state probabilities, but it's not very good for analyzing the energy gap precisely.

So you just plug in the right $s$ values and find the eigenvalues of that $H(s)$, and plotting that gives you the eigenspectrum in Fig. 1.

6052,6052,9607,Best practice for avoiding module / theme / profile name clashes?,"We currently have our code managed such that each site has its own theme and install profile. 
These have naturally evolved in such a way that the names of these items (and their directories) tend to be the same. 

For example, one site's theme and profile are both called 'dennis'

This causes problems with feature servers, and (I'm suspecting) with Aegir.

Now... it's relatively easy to rename either of these (although, for various reasons it's noticeably easier to rename the profile). Is there any sort of best practice here, ie is it normal to call the theme dennis_theme, or the profile dennis_profile? Should I apply this convention to both, or just to one?

It also fixes the vectors $\vec{u}= \langle 1,1, 0 \rangle$ and $\vec{v} = \langle -1,1,-2 \rangle$ that are perpendicular to each other and to $\vec{n}$.  More generaly, $\vec{u}$ could be any vector whose dot product with $\vec{n}$ is zero (such vectors are easy to find) and $\vec{v} = \vec{n}\times\vec{u}$.

This technique can be used to derive Bubba's answer, although I used Mathematica to do the heavy lifting for me.

$$

However, seeing Bubba's answer reminded me wonderful and simple Householder reflections are. Just define the function $f:{\mathbb R}^n \rightarrow {\mathbb R}^n$ by $f(x)=\vec{x}-2\vec{n}(\vec{n}^T\vec{x})$, where $\vec{x}$ is a column vector and $\vec{n}$ is a unit column vector denoting your normal.  It's super simple to check that $f$ maps $\vec{n}$ to $-\vec{n}$:
$$f(\vec{n}) = \vec{n}-2\vec{n}(\vec{n}^T\vec{n}) = \vec{n}-2\vec{n}1=-\vec{n},$$
where $\vec{n}^T\vec{n}=1$, since $\vec{n}$ is a unit vector.  It's also super simple to see that any vector $\vec{x}$ perpendicular to $\vec{n}$ is fixed by $f$, since
$$f(\vec{x}) = \vec{x}-2\vec{n}(\vec{n}^T\vec{x}) = \vec{x}-2\vec{n}0=\vec{x}.$$

Factoring out the $\vec{x}$ from the definition of $f$, we see the matrix you need:
$$I-2\vec{n}\,\vec{n}^T.$$

Applying this to your situation, we get the same matrix as above.

4334,4334,6901,Brute force login attempt from spoofed IP's,"I see that many of my WordPress installs are being hit with 1000+ failed login attempts using non-existing 'admin' account name. The requests come from different IP's every time, and I see IP's such as 8.8.8.8 (google's public dns) as the origin of some of the login attempts.

I use WordFence to detect and block these attempts, but the block is based on IP, so it's not so efficient.

My question is:


Is it 'normal' for low profile WordPress sites to get these 'attacks'? I've notices an increase in the logs during the first days of 2013.
Is it something to worry about, and is it possible to detect/verify if a login request is coming from a spoofed IP?

And Guangzhou Evergrande FC challenges Bayern Munich on their newly released posters with this slogan: Where Amazing Happens. 



I am wondering if this slogan is a right expression. Amazing is an adjective without doubt, then how could it be used alone as a subject? I have thought this over and now I guess maybe it is acceptable using some simplified, less-grammatical expressions for news titles and slogans, isn't it? 
",dennylv,https://ell.stackexchange.com/users/2986,"The poster is correct.

This type of reframing of an adjective as a noun used in the English-speaking world, and is beloved by advertizers:


  A mouthful of ""awesome"" in every bite!


Tongue-in-cheek speech:


  Auditioner: Okay, can you portray the same character, but make him ... sad?
  
  Actor: Sorry, no, I don't do ""sad"". Unless it's ""cheesy sad""; I'm a comedian!
  
  Auditioner (to others): Did you hear that? We have a clown here (which I mean literally as well as pejoratively) who says he doesn't do ""sad"", unless it is ""cheesy sad"".


Another example:


  A: I went on a date with a really intelligent guy, but he intellectualized every topic we talked about.
  
  B: I hear you. Intelligent is good. Nerdy: not so much.


We probably accept this kind of thing by imagining the word to be completely outside of the syntax, as if wrapped in quotes (which is why I wrote all the examples that way).

The ability to use pieces of language as nouns is necessary, because it allows us to talk about language. We can say things like:


  A: Blurchmoop!
  
  B: What on Earth is ""blurchmoop?""


Or:


  ""up on"" is a different preposition from ""upon"".


We cannot stop ourselves from saying sentences like these because we don't know the lexical category of blurchmoop, or because ""up on"" isn't a noun, and so cannot serve as the subject to the verb ""is"".

A piece of quoted language can serve as a noun, or even a verb, to make these kinds of sentences work, and as a byproduct, it lets us say things like ""awesome lives here"" or ""I'm with stupid"".

Also note that ""amazing"" can in fact be regarded as simply the gerund form of ""to amaze"".  Thus, ""where amazing happens"" can be interpreted similarly to ""where cooking happens"". However, this is not the interpretation which jumps out at me; and if I wanted to convey that meaning, I would say, ""where amazement happens"". Because ""amazing"" is a common adjective, we do not use the gerund form ""amazing"" in contexts where it is not clear that it cannot possibly be the adjective, such as, ""He goes around amazing everyone with his skill"".  So if ""where amazing happens"" is used by someone with the intent of invoking the gerund meaning, patterned after ""where cooking happens"", that someone must not be a native speaker of English. By dumb luck, however, that someone has created a glib phrase suitable for an advertizement.

Another thing: ""the amazing"" is definitely a noun.


  Every morning, Bob the Contortionist does the amazing; he bends over backwards and bites his own left ankle.


The slogan in the poster could be expressed as:


  Where The Amazing Happens


Finally, check this out. There are some adjectives in English that serve as nouns also, such as various -ible and -able words: convertible, deductible, dirigible, ...

Something can be convertible, and we can have ""a convertible"" and ""the convertible"".

Now imagine if such a word were used for something uncountable. For instance, gases are like liquids, but they are compressible. What if we coined the word ""compressible"" as a way to say ""gas""? 

Then we could quite perfectly say something like this, without any article ""the"" or ""a"":


  This pipe is where compressible escapes from the tank.


Which is not so different from ""where amazing happens"". So maybe ""where amazing happens"" is not that far fetched; perhaps we do not have to resort to hypotheses about quoted material being treated as a noun.

379,379,597,PostGIS is rejecting an srid code for my projection. I've found a nearly identical projection w/ a legit srid. Will it work?,"My projection is this: NAD 1983 StatePlane North Carolina FIPS 3200 Feet, which has a proj4 string that looks like this:

Its SRID is 102719. I've tried to create a db column in PostGIS with an srid option for this projection, but its rejecting the srid, calling it invalid.

I've found a similar projection with a valid srid code, NAD83 / North Carolina (ftUS) (srid=2264), which has a proj4 string nearly identical to the above:

+proj=lcc +lat_1=36.16666666666666 +lat_2=34.33333333333334 +lat_0=33.75 +lon_0=-79 +x_0=609601.2192024384 +y_0=0 +ellps=GRS80 +datum=NAD83 +to_meter=0.3048006096012192 +no_defs 


As you can see, the only difference between these two is that the lat_1 and lat_2 degrees are swapped. They even use the same three degrees, only the first two are differently ordered.

Can I use this second projection?

3419,3419,5443,What is the the Ehrenfest-Oppenheimer rule on the statistics of composite systems?,"Ehrenfest 1931 gives an argument to the effect that the application of the spin-statistics theorem to composite systems is valid, but only as an approximation and under certain conditions. Unfortunately this article is behind a paywall. The abstract reads as follows:


  From Pauli's exclusion principle we derive the rule for the symmetry of the wave functions in the coordinates of the center of gravity of two similar stable clusters of electrons and protons, and justify the assumption that the clusters satisfy the Einstein-Bose or Fermi-Dirac statistics according to whether the number of particles in each cluster is even or odd. The rule is shown to become invalid only when the interaction between the clusters is large enough to disturb their internal motion.


The quaintness of the abstract is enhanced by the mysterious failure to mention neutrons -- this being explained by the fact that the neutron was not discovered experimentally until the following year. Pretty amusing that the American Physical Society still owns the copyright on a paper this old, one of whose authors was probably paid through my grandparents' and great-grandparents' income taxes.

Googling quickly turns up various loose verbal characterizations of this result, without proof. Can anyone supply an outline of how the argument works and possibly a more precise statement of what the result really is?

Some sources seem to refer to this as the Wigner-Ehrenfest-Oppenheimer (WEO) result or Ehrenfest-Oppenheimer-Bethe (EOB) rule. Historically, Feynman seems to have used this result to show that Cooper pairs were bosonic.

Although I've tagged this question as quantum field theory, and the spin-statistics theorem is relativistic, the 1931 date seems to indicate that this would have been a result in nonrelativistic quantum mechanics. This answer by akhmeteli sketches what seems to be a similar relativistic result from a book by Lipkin.

In the limit of low-energy experiments, the EO rule says the usual spin-statistics connection applies, and this seems extremely plausible. If not, then it would be too good to be true: we would be able to probe the composite structure of a system to arbitrarily high energies without having to build particle accelerators.

Bethe 1997 has the following argument:


  Consider now tightly bound composite objects like nuclei. It then makes sense to ask for the symmetry of the wavefunction of a system containing many identical objects of the same type, e.g., many He4 nuclei. This symmetry can be deduced by imagining that the interchange of two composites is carried out particle by particle. Each interchange of fermions changes the sign of the wavefunction. Hence the composite will be a fermion if and only if it contains an odd number of fermions[...]


Note the qualifier ""tightly bound,"" which implies a restriction to low-energy experiments. The abstract of Ehrenfest 1931 seems to say that this is a necessary assumption, but it is never used in Bethe and Jackiw's argument, and this suggests that their argument is an oversimplification.

Fujita 2009 recaps the Bethe-Jackiw argument, but then says:


  We shall see later that these arguments are incomplete. We note that Feynman used these arguments to deduce that Cooper pairs [5] (pairons) are bosonic [6]. The symmetry of the many-particle wavefunction and the quantum statistics for elementary particles are one-to-one [1]. [...] But no one-to-one correspondence exists for composites since composites, by construction, have extra degrees of freedom. Wavefunctions and second-quantized operators are important auxiliary quantum variables, but they are not observables in Dirac's sense [1]. We must examine the observable occupation numbers for the study of the quantum statistics of composites. In the present chapter we shall show that EOB's rule applies to the Center-of-Mass (CM) motion of composites.


Unfortunately I only have access to Fujita through a keyhole, so I can't see what the references are or any of the details that they promise in this beginning-of-chapter preview.

The historical context is interesting. This was before the neutron was discovered experimentally, so they thought nuclei were made out of protons and electrons. What we would today describe as a nucleus with mass number $A$ and atomic number $Z$, they would describe as a system consisting of $m$ protons plus $n$ electrons bound inside the nucleus, where $m=A$ and $n=A-Z$. (These $n$ electrons are in addition to the $m$ electrons that are outside the nucleus.) This model gets the statistics of a nucleus wrong when $N$ is odd, and the discrepancy had shown up in the spectroscopy of rotational bands of symmetric diatomic molecules such as $\text{N}_2$.

Regardless of whether you use the archaic model of the nucleus or a modern one, you're dealing with two species of fermions inside the nucleus. This leads to a lot of complications in the notation and equations, which I think is not really crucial to the content of what people would today describe as the Ehrenfest-Oppenheimer rule. I think all the interesting issues can be seen when there is only one species of fundamental fermion present, so that simplified version is what I'll outline here.

The argument, if I'm understanding it properly, seems to be as follows. You have two identical composite systems, which if not interacting would be described by internal quantum numbers $\sigma$ and $\tau$ and quantum numbers $s$ and $t$ describing their center-of-mass motions. Under interchange of the members of the two clusters, the wavefunction $|F\rangle=|st,\sigma\tau\rangle$ representing them has to pick up a phase $\theta=(-1)^k$. We can make such a wavefunction out of a Slater determinant. We then fairly trivially obtain --

The Ehrenfest-Oppenheimer rule: If the internal states of the two clusters are the same, $\sigma=\tau$, then under interchange of the centers of mass $s$ and $t$, the total wavefunction picks up a phase $\theta$.

If we now turn on an interaction between the two clusters, the E-O rule is no longer exact, and the meat of the paper is to show the conditions under which it is a sufficient approximation. The wavefunction F is no longer a stationary state. However, the set of such wavefunctions still represents a complete basis, so we can write the actual physical state $|\phi\rangle$ as a superposition of the F's. This mixes the F's, and the mixing destroys the symmetry under interchange of $s$ and $t$. However, the mixing depends on matrix elements of the form

$$ \langle st,\sigma\tau | H | s't',\sigma'\tau' \rangle $$

where $\sigma\ne\sigma'$, $\tau\ne\tau'$, i.e., the internal states are different. The resulting mixing is then small when the energy scale of the interaction between the two clusters is small compared to the energy differences $E_\sigma-E_{\sigma'}$ for $\sigma\ne\sigma'$. This is, for example, an excellent approximation for the nuclei in a diatomic molecule.

5365,5365,8520,Java ServiceLoader with multiple Classloaders,"What are the best practices for using ServiceLoader in an Environment with multiple ClassLoaders? The documentation recommends to create and save a single service instance at initialization:

private static ServiceLoader&lt;CodecSet&gt; codecSetLoader = ServiceLoader.load(CodecSet.class);


This would initialize the ServiceLoader using the current context classloader. Now suppose this snippet is contained in a class loaded using a shared classloader in a web container and multiple web applications want to define their own service implementations. These would not get picked up in the above code, it might even be possible that the loader gets initialized using the first webapps context classloader and provide the wrong implementation to other users.

Always creating a new ServiceLoader seems wasteful performance wise since it has to enumerate and parse service files each time. Edit: This can even be a big performance problem as shown in this answer regarding java's XPath implementation.

How do other libraries handle this? Do they cache the implementations per classloader, do they reparse their configuration everytime or do they simply ignore this problem and only work for one classloader?
",Jörn Horstmann,https://stackoverflow.com/users/139595,"This question seem to be more complicated than I first anticipated. As I see
it, there are 3 possible strategies for dealing with ServiceLoaders.


Use a static ServiceLoader instance and only support loading classes from
the same classloader as the one holding the ServiceLoader reference. This
would work when


The service configuration and implementation are in a shared classloader
and all child classloaders are using the same implementation. The example
in the documentation is geared towards theis use case.

Or
Configuration and implementation are put into each child classloader and
deployed along each webapp in WEB-INF/lib.


In this scenario it is not possible to deploy the service in a shared classloader
and let each webapp choose its own service implementation.
Initialize the ServiceLoader on each access passing the context classloader of
the current thread as the second parameter. This approach is taken be the JAXP
and JAXB apis, although they are using their own FactoryFinder implementation
instead of ServiceLoader. So it is possible to bundle a xml parser with a webapp
and have it automatically get picked up for example by DocumentBuilderFactory#newInstance.

This lookup has a performance impact, but in the case of xml parsing
the time to look up the implementation is small compared to the time needed to
actually parse a xml document. In the library I'm envisioning the factory
itself is pretty simple so the lookup time would dominate the performance.
Somehow cache the implementation class with the context classloader as the key.
I'm not entirely sure if this is possible in all the above cases without
causing any memory leaks.

The document recommends that you create and save a single service instance at initialization:,"This question seem to be more complicated than I first anticipated. As I see
it, there are 3 possible strategies for dealing with ServiceLoaders.


Use a static ServiceLoader instance and only support loading classes from
the same classloader as the one holding the ServiceLoader reference. This
would work when


The service configuration and implementation are in a shared classloader
and all child classloaders are using the same implementation. The example
in the documentation is geared towards theis use case.

Or
Configuration and implementation are put into each child classloader and
deployed along each webapp in WEB-INF/lib.


In this scenario it is not possible to deploy the service in a shared classloader
and let each webapp choose its own service implementation.
Initialize the ServiceLoader on each access passing the context classloader of
the current thread as the second parameter. This approach is taken be the JAXP
and JAXB apis, although they are using their own FactoryFinder implementation
instead of ServiceLoader. So it is possible to bundle a xml parser with a webapp
and have it automatically get picked up for example by DocumentBuilderFactory#newInstance.

This lookup has a performance impact, but in the case of xml parsing
the time to look up the implementation is small compared to the time needed to
actually parse a xml document. In the library I'm envisioning the factory
itself is pretty simple so the lookup time would dominate the performance.
Somehow cache the implementation class with the context classloader as the key.
I'm not entirely sure if this is possible in all the above cases without
causing any memory leaks.


In conclusion, I will probably be ignoring this problem and require that the library

Explanation:

Right now this program accesses a file from a file manager that takes the selected files path and sets it to the 'mFilename' EditText field. The show PDF button listener below shows the String 'pdffilename' gets assigned the String contained in the 'mFilename' EditText field. The PdfViewerActivity is started and the String 'pdffilename' is passed as an Extra. In the onCreate() the intent is checked if null or not. This is where I think the change can/should be made. The String 'pdffilename' is assigned what you see below. What I want to do is store the PDF files in one of two ways... int the 'res/raw/example_folder/example.pdf' or in the assets folder. I want to assign 'pdffilename' programmatically with the path for where I am storing these PDF files. I have tried many different approaches all of which have either did not compile, caused errors, or caused a ""file: res/raw/example_folder/example.pdf does not exist!"".

So Basically...

2841,2841,4521,"Hebrew for ice - and other ""new"" words","After reading MB OC 301:17:65 (thanks, YDK!) I am baffled by a nagging question regarding Modern Hebrew and Biblical Hebrew. Eliezer Ben-Yehudah is known to have revitalized Hebrew, in part by taking Biblical and post-Biblical (often Mishnaic and/or Rabbinic) Hebrew words, and sometimes Aramaic words, and adapting them to modern uses. But there are words that are not new to the world, and certainly could not have been new to our ancestors, which he apparently adapted from the classical sources because he could not find evidence of them there but found similar words that could be made to apply. The example I'm trying to understand is the Hebrew word for ""ice"".

In the Mishnah Berurah above why did the M""B need to describe ice as ""water which has frozen""? Furthermore, why did he have to Hebraicize the Aramaic word for ""freeze""? Is there no classical Hebrew word for ""ice"" or even ""freeze""? According to http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0131.htm ""קֶרַח"" translates as ""frost"". According to http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/גלד the word ""גלד"" is Aramaic for ""freeze"" and Hebrew (presumably modern) for ""scab"". I have also seen elsewhere in my search today that ""גלד"" is also used in the context of congealing (I believe in Hebrew).

Why is it that there's a bazillion different types of screws? Why can't we just always use one standard screw type? Are there advantages/disadvantages to the different types? Are there times when one type is preferred over another?

Help me understand why there isn't one screw to rule them all.
",Doug T.,https://diy.stackexchange.com/users/321,"First, I really like Eric's answer for practical reasons.  But there is another side to screw head diversity:  Security.

In the end, it's usually a temporary measure.  Once a company invents a new screw, some third party will start selling tools to remove them.  But for a time, any new screw design means the only people who can open your parts are ""certified"" workshops you've given tools to.  Personally I see this a lot in electronic equipment, where the original manufacturer wants some aspect of design kept private or doesn't want after-market mods made to things they sell.  Nintendo is particularly active in inventing new screws.

Examples of security screws include 3-prong Torx variants, and Allen heads with a raised dot in the middle of the screw head to stop standard Allen wrenches from fitting.

But there is another side to screw head diversity:  Security.

In the end, it's usually a temporary measure.  Once a company invents a new screw, some third party will start selling tools to remove them.  But for a time, any new screw design means the only people who can open your parts are ""certified"" workshops you've given tools to.  Personally I see this a lot in electronic equipment, where the original manufacturer wants some aspect of design kept private or doesn't want after-market mods made to things they sell.  Nintendo is particularly active in inventing new screws.

Examples of security screws include 3-prong Torx variants, and Allen heads with a raised dot in the middle of the screw head to stop standard Allen wrenches from fitting.

4986,4986,7940,Paying for mortgage points vs investing that money,"First time home buyer here.

So I've been reading about points and how an up-front payment can save you money in the long term.  At first, the numbers seem pretty convincing.  For example, pay $5000 upfront for a whopping saving of $20,000 over 30 years.  

... But if you took that $5000 and invested it, wouldn't you get a lot more than that over 30 years, even at a modest return rate of 6-7%?  Suddenly points seem worthless.

Is my math wrong?  Is there some other advantage regarding points that I'm missing?

The recommended range for the flash isn't more than about 100mm, past that, its usefulness is limited. Using the integrated diffusion panel allows extended wide-angle coverage to 14mm.

It wouldn't hurt to have a better flash than the integrated one but it all depends on what you'll be shooting. With the 15-55mm lens i'd expect the integrated flash to do good enough.

For corporate aircraft, this is a common occurrence and there have indeed been attempts to utilise these legs. A quick search on Google for empty legs turns up plenty of results. I came across two companies called flyvictor and returnjet that offered a bunch of flights from all spots in Europe.

Another similar possibility is getting a ticket for an extra seat on corporate jets that are not 'ferry flights' but simply have extra capacity. This article (""How to fly on a private jet for under $200 per person"") might interest you.

Note:


They are 'opportunist' in nature. There is no guarantee a flight will turn up for your desired route, and/or there will be a return flight.
The company will always try and sell a flight like a normal charter if possible.




Commercial Aircraft

For commercial airlines, ferry flights are avoided as far as possible. They are (in principle) nothing but money down the drain. You will encounter ferry flights:


When you need to move the aircraft for maintence. 


British Airways run a facility in Cardiff for maintaining among others their huge fleet of Boeing 747s.
Austrian Airlines run a facility in Bratislava, requiring a 20-minute hop for aircraft due for maintence from Vienna. 

When stuff messes up, most notably breakdowns. For instance, an mechanical breakdown at a remote airport followed by ferrying the aircraft back once repaired.


The issue is that:


These flights are often at strange and/or irregular times.
Occasionally crewed by only cockpit crew and no flight attendants.


As such, there is little incentive for airlines to let passengers along even (if it may legally possible). The cost, time, paperwork and extra staff would most probably not pay off for the low number of passengers that could be expected.

4941,4941,7867,Why do different pain killers have different effects on people?,"I've noticed some pain killers working great for me, while others have no effect.

Works for me


Aspirin
APC &dagger;
Naproxen


Doesn't work for me


Paracetamol
Diclofenac
Tramadol


I doubt there is much of a placebo effect at work, since most of these either did or did not work when I first took them, without having expectations either way.

Whenever I have a head ache, I take an APC. I suspect it's actually the aspirin in there that does the job, since when I take just paracetamol, it doesn't do squat. As a kid I got children's aspirin, which worked.

I once had a severe back ache. I was prescribed diclofenac (a heavier variant than the over the counter one), which didn't work. I was then prescribed tramadol &mdash; same results. I then tried naproxen, which worked rightaway.

Why do some pain killers work while others don't?

Is there an underlying mechanism, that explains why some of these work while others don't? Does that predict if pain killers that I haven't used yet will work?

Please note that I'm not looking for medical advice on which pain killers to take; I'm just curious about how my body interacts with the various ones.



&dagger;: the one consisting of aspirin, paracetamol, and caffeine, not the one containing phenaticin. Think Excedrin.

Drug action is a complex process consisting of many steps. Let's take a simple example: A systemic direct inhibitor of a kinase. This drug would need to*:


Be absorbed into your bloodstream
Remain in your bloodstream for sufficient time
Be absorbed into the tissue
Be able to bind the target protein


1 can fail due to interaction with other concurrently taken drugs or food, or simply genetic factors affecting the particular functioning of the gut mucosa. 2 can fail because the kidneys are too good at eliminating it, or the liver is metabolizing it too agressively (both also subject to modulation by other drugs, foods and genetic factors). 3 can fail because the transports in the cells aren't working as rapidly, or represent an allele less likely to take in the drug, or are modulated by other drugs/foods. The tissue can also have efflux pumps or enzymes that break down the drug. 4 can fail because the drug was designed for a specific allele of that kinase, but you happen to have a different allele, which has a slightly different structure that is no longer targeted by this drug.

Then you have a host of physiological variables, and addiction/tolerance.

Apparently the most common genetic reason by far for variable drug sensitivity is the specific set of CYP genes you have. CYP enzymes are abundant in the liver and chemically process various molecules (including drugs).

Besides this, an interesting set of specific examples used to be available from 23andme. I'm not sure if they still provide this after the FDA ban on health information.

",Yossi Gil,https://tex.stackexchange.com/users/3391,"The MWE example presented contains some conceptual errors.

The most relevant one, I think, is that you wish to reference nodes through their text and not through their name. That's what I read in:

\node(b)  [draw,rectangle,text=olive] at (3,0) {there};

The \path syntax should contain a and b, not here and there.

Second, here the late options are used in the wrong manner: once the path is ended, that's it, you can't append stuff anymore. So, in measuring south you are willing to insert path rather than append after command.

It sounds more consonant in the treble clef above middle C and more dissonant in the bass clef. However the proportions of the frequencies are exactly the same. This doesn't make any sense that it is more dissonant in the bass while the proportions are the same. Frequency proportions being the same should suggest the same amount of dissonance in every octave.

So why are dissonant intervals and chords more dissonant in the bass clef and more consonant in the treble clef? 
",Caters,https://music.stackexchange.com/users/9749,"In general, smaller intervals do not sound as pleasing in a bass register as they do in a treble register. This is a general effect that occurs regardless of whether you play a consonance or a dissonance, although it is more noticeable with dissonances.

What happens is that the overtones of the bass notes end up having more noticeable clashes between them, and those clashes are more audible because they are lower in pitch. When you are in a higher register, the clashing overtones occur at a much higher, and therefore less noticeable range.

One way to get around this is to use a more open voicing. For example, instead of playing C-E-G#, try playing C-G#-E. Unfortunately, that's a tenth, and not playable for many left hands.

The problem is that Mathematica can't calculate the last integral for any arbitrary $n$, although it can, correctly, calculate its value for hardcoded $n$s. Like $n=1,2,...$.

My question is:
Do you have any idea on how I could calculate it, perhaps by rewriting it a bit, or by using some other trick? In case it helps, the result should be $n^2\pi^2$.

Note: Actually it can be calculated with Cauchy's residue theorem, but I'd like to avoid taking that route, if possible. Though, if it can't be done otherwise, I will post a solution with residual calculation so that this question has an answer.

4438,4438,7046,Mathematics of a leading signal for a sine wave,"Taken from elsewhere on the web : -

""The derivative of a sine function is

d SIN(ω*t) / dt = ω * COS(ω t)
where ω = angular frequency = 2 π *frequency

and this derivative leads the original function by 90
degrees (a quarter period) because a cosine wave leads a sine wave by
90 degrees. This derivative is also different in amplitude from
the original sine wave because the cosine wave is multiplied by the
angular frequency. If we take the simple difference of equally spaced successive points of the sine wave (i.e. 20 points in a 20 period sine wave, 21 points in a 21 period sine wave etc.) we can cause that difference to have the same amplitude as the sine wave if we “normalize” the difference. Normalization is done by multiplying the difference by (1/ω). In the case the sine wave the angular frequency is 2*Pi divided by the period of the sine wave therefore the amplitude normalization factor is

Normalizer = Period / (2*π)

Using the normalizer, this difference function of sine wave now has the same amplitude as the sine wave and leads it by 90 degrees in phase (a quarter cycle). The amount of phase lead can be reduced with a little vector arithmetic. Vector addition of the sine wave and difference function results in a vector that leads the sine wave by only 45 degrees. Since this vector forms the hypotenuse of a right angled triangle, it is also larger than the sine wave by a factor of 1.414. We simply divide the sum by 1.414 to achieve the
correct amplitude for our leading signal.

In summary, we create a leading signal by taking the
difference of equally spaced successive samples of a sine wave; multiply that difference by Period/(2*π); add that product to the sine wave; and divide the sum by 1.414.""

I would like to use this approach to create a leading signal for a sine wave which always has a set constant lead e.g. the above approach gives a 2.5 point lead for a 20 period sine wave but will give a 5 point lead for a 40 period sine wave. Since I will always know the period and the difference between successive points of the sine wave, how can I adjust the vector arithmetic so that the lead will always be a constant 2.5 points (or constant 3.5 points, whatever?) irrespective of the sine wave period?

I'm mainly wondering about the header. Is it bad to keep a more mobile like design (meaning slide menus, e.t.c.) on desktop, or should I utilize more of the space that mobile would not have?
",Tinfoilboy,https://ux.stackexchange.com/users/47826,"First off all, I appreciate that you seem to design your responsive web with a mobile-first approach (that's how I perceive it anyway).

As Imperative has already stated, consistency is generally a good thing. However, the mobile-sized interface might still be come through as consistent with the desktop-sized ditto even though they don't share the exact same navigation pattern. For instance branding elements, graphical profile, copy, artwork and information architecture might keep it together just fine. Especially important is that the IA is, at least, very similar for the users to find their way around the site. When the content is grouped and structured the same way, a user that is familiar with one of the platforms but new to the second will know what to look for and have a hunch of how too, which helps a lot. 

The off-canvas drawer menu is (obviously) a solution that partially solves a common mobile interface problem: the deficit of real estate. But that's a problem that rarely applies when it comes to desktop interfaces. Consistency is valuable, but should you be consistent between your own interfaces, or with the standards for the respective platforms they're being used in?

Off-canvas drawer for mobile:  


Access to all top level navigation items in one place 
Robust in a sense that new items can be added in infinity (can be a curse too:)
Menu button is in a convenient position (even though it's usually in the ""hard"" corner)


Off-canvas for desktop: 


I guess Fitt's law still applies, and the expedition up the north-western corner of the screen can actually be quite long. A drop in efficiency?
You don't always want to fill the entire width with content as the user can use a very wide screen on a PC, which can make the positioning of the menu and its button really awkward, and actually even hard to see. 
A button in the corner can interfere with hot corners, or rather, the other way around. 
An extra click, that could have been avoided, is added to reach a menu item.
The menu items are obscured until the user has visited the menu, when they could have been displayed directly.

",mikmak,https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/users/14306,"No, that's the correct behavior of make oldconfig command.

It picks up the available .config, in this case belonging to an older kernel version, and produces a new .config file making the proper corrections where possible and asking to the user whenever new and empty entries are found.

As you can see in your screenshot, the make oldconfig command is giving itself the proper [Y/n/m] answers until it's able to do so. When it encounters the CONFIG_ARPD line and it needs to embed/disable it (the module option is not given for this entry), the script finds that the entry is present in the kernel you want to compile but not in the .config you supplied. Given that the script has no clue of what to do, it asks to the user.

Now the problem is: what answers should I give to the make oldconfig command? Unfortunately there is no simple, algorithmic answer to this question and this is why the Linux kernel compilation is still artisanry. As a general rule of thumb, apart of googling for the simbol name (e.g. what is CONFIG_ARPD?), whenever you encounter a new driver that you never heard of, it's safe to say [m] because modules almost always just increase your kernel size, giving (almost always) no other performance hit until they're actually loaded and used. Conversely, if you say CONFIG_NETFILTER=y or even worst CONFIG_SMP=y you must know that just for enabling one of this (huge) key-features, your Linux kernel will be slower compared to a UP (UniProcessor == non-SMP) kernel with Netfilter disabled, because this kernel entries translate one-to-one to large #ifdef blocks that are enabled, compiled and executed.

5541,5541,8802,Do delegates defy OOP,"I'm trying to understand OOP so I can write better OOP code and one thing which keeps coming up is this concept of a delegate (using .NET).

160,160,253,Using nofollow when crosslinking my own sites,"I have 20 sites in the same domain, different niches and I want to interlink them for USER EXPERIENCE. I want to know from someone who tested this:

Will using a nofollow attribute for the links keep the sites safe from google link scheme penalties?
",webmasters,https://webmasters.stackexchange.com/users/7392,"Nofollow SHOULD help from a pure outbound/inbound link perspective, but I haven't tested this personally.  If Google isn't seeing site B sending site A links, you should be good.

But I think there's more to it than just blindly saying if StackExchange is doing it, there isn't a problem if you do link them all to each other.  I think you have to weigh multiple factors, three of which are the type (of content) of sites in your network, their subject matter, and the number of links created.  Is all the content created by you?  Is it an aggregator site?  Is it a Blogger site with copy and pastes from other sites, with nothing but Adsense on it?  If the content is original, you're better off, but I don't think completely safe from penalties.  As Aurelio De Rosa mentioned above, linking sites with similar subject matter will be more beneficial than just linking all 20 very different sites together.  And if we're only talking about a small percentage of your overall inbound links, it probably won't hurt.

I'm facing a similar issue with my network of sites (all related to one industry) that you're trying to avoid.  It's made up of 6 sites, of which 4 are included in the footer of every page on those 4 sites.  After Googles April/May algorithm update, we saw a dramatic decrease in keyword rankings and actually dropped off the first 10 pages completely for a couple of them (after being on the first page).  We  received warnings from Google that our page exhibited ""unnatural inbound links"", of which 2 of the 4 sites I mentioned numbered 350K+ inbound links.  One of those sites is a news aggregator, all others are UGC and original content.  After making changes and submitting a couple reconsideration requests, we're still seeing the warnings.  Our next test is the nofollow approach you suggested.  We'll start by reducing those 350k links by some percentage and hope for something positive from Google.

5158,5158,8199,What is the case for interpreting the Genesis creation account literally?,"I think we can all agree that the entire Bible is not meant to be taken literally.  Consider the Song of Solomon (what would his lover look like if we take it literally?) or the book of Revelation.

So I would like to understand the case for believing the Genesis creation account, among all Biblical texts, is one that is intended to be interpreted literally. I'm not interested in scientific evidence for a young-earth in these answers. I'm interested in Biblical or historical reasons why this text, as a whole (as opposed to individual words), should be considered literal.

I would also discourage answers that address specific words in the Genesis account (such as the Hebrew 'yom'), but if that is the strongest evidence you have, then I won't consider it an invalid answer.
",Flimzy,https://christianity.stackexchange.com/users/20,"No textual reason for interpreting Genesis figuratively

Whenever we ask why we should take something in the Bible as literal, we must start by asking ask why we should not take it as literal.  Does the text give us any reason to interpret it as being figurative?  In the book of Revelation, and other places where mortal man is given a glimpse of eternity, descriptions employ the use of comparison quite frequently.  It was like this or had the appearance of that.  The Genesis account employs no such language.  

(By the way, the assumption that the Song of Solomon is figuratively is certainly debatable.)

The Order of Genesis

In fact, the Genesis account is written as if it were an actual account with a very logical order.  There are six distinct units in which creative works take place.  Each of these units is described as a day, with an evening and a morning.  (The Jewish and Muslim traditions still follow this pattern by marking sundown as the beginning of the next day.)

Genesis 1:2 identifies the nature of the earth:


  The earth was without form and void, and darkness was over the
  face of the deep. And the Spirit of God was hovering over the face of
  the waters.  Genesis 1:2 ESV


I have heard this original state of ""without form and void"" paraphrased as unformed and unfilled.  The first three days of Genesis are dedicated to forming while the second three days are dedicated to filling.  What is formed on the first day is filled on the 4th days, whatever is formed on the 2nd day is filled on the 5th, and so forth.  So, there are specific divisions that represent a very orderly process, which aligns better with an actual record rather than a figurative story.

Confirmation of Scripture

As Warren noted, other places in Scripture affirm the six days of creation.


  Six days you shall labor and do all your work, but the seventh day is
  a sabbath of the LORD your God .. For in six days the LORD made the
  heavens and the earth, the sea and all that is in them, and rested on
  the seventh day.  Exodus 20:8-11 NASB


Problems with figurative interpretations

Finally, the figurative interpretation breaks down.  If a days is a billion years, then how did flowers get pollinated when there were no bees in existence for another billion years?  Also, if the sixth day is a billion years from Adam, then we have not yet reached the 7th day of God's rest, since we have a genealogy from Adam that is roughly 6,000 years.  Fictitious characters do not have genealogies.  No one can trace his lineage back to Elmer Fudd or Pecos Bill, yet the Bible details a genealogy from Adam to Jesus Himself.

What reason is there to take it as figurative?

So, we might ask, from where does anyone get the notion that the Genesis account ought to be taken figuratively.  Quite simply, it comes from teachings based on a portion of scientific inquiry that purports irrefutable evidence of an old earth.  

It is fairly easy to see that a literal interpretation of Genesis does not fit with a very old earth.  The assumption is made, for whatever reason, that it must be the irrefutable scientific evidence that is correct.  The question, then, is what to do with Genesis, and this is answered by reinterpreting it figuratively.

The main problem with this is the assumption of the truthfulness regarding the selective data that purports irrefutable evidence of an old earth.  The problems and inconsistencies in the evidence are not given to the general public, but appear to be deliberately withheld.  Neither are the lines of scientific evidence that point to a young earth given to the general public.  To be truly scientific, all the evidence and all the data should be made available to all students.  Theological assumptions made by individual scientist, whether they be Theistic or Atheistic, should be withheld.  True science has no ax to grind other than the truth it seeks to find, so it should welcome all inquiry and debate.

Conclusion

So, the Genesis account does not give any indication of requiring figurative interpretation.  It actually details a very logical and orderly creation.  Other places in Scripture reference the six days of creation.  Finally, the figurative interpretation doesn't make any sense.

So, the Genesis account does not give any indication of requiring figurative interpretation.  It actually details a very logical and orderly creation.  Other places in Scripture reference the six days of creation.  Finally, the figurative interpretation doesn't make any sense.

3994,3994,6376,How can I get a PieChart to be colored as I wish?,"How to use the value of a funtion[label] to assign color to a piece of the pie?

(edited after answer of kguler )
My dude is how to control the colors in ranges of a function of [labels]

In this way I can show:
1.- the percentage of Data(labels), using pieces of pie and
2.- the value f of labels, with range colors (similar to TemperatureMap but customized)



------ Original Post ------

I want to use a ""gradient"" or ""a reduce (5-6) list of colors""(similar to DarkRainbow with a little colors)?

I was trying with ColorData and ColorDataFunction ( here you can see that I obtain errors with the same code as the reference doc ) but I have no succes!!

percent = {12, 18, 24, 46}
labels = {1, 9, 15, 22}
f = {8, 7, 1, 4}
PieChart[percent, ChartLabels -&gt; labels, ImageSize -&gt; 200, PlotLabel -&gt; ""Test-Grad"",  ChartStyle -&gt; ColorData[""TemperatureMap"" {0, 8}]]
PieChart[percent, ChartLabels -&gt; labels, ImageSize -&gt; 200, PlotLabel -&gt; ""Test-Comic"", ChartStyle -&gt; ColorData[9, ""ColorList""]]

 ColorFunction -&gt; ColorData[""DarkRainbow""]]




Note there is no color scheme called ""gradient"" - there is a class of schemes called gradients, you can use ColorData[""Gradients""] to see the particular named schemes.

If you want more control over colors assigned, point ColorFunction to your own function that does whatever is needed to the data and returns the appropriate color(s).

1520,1520,2390,Idolatry in churches allowed?,"It is very frequent to see idols of Jesus or any biblical entities in  a Church , So is such idolatry allowed by  the bible,considering the following verses?


  ""You must not make for yourself an idol of any kind or an image of anything in the heavens or on the earth or in the sea"".
  Exodus 20:4


History tells us that:


  sometimes objects that God instructed to be made were turned into
  idols by the Israelites. The Book of Numbers contains a narrative in
  which God instructed Moses to make a bronze snake as part of
  addressing a plague of venomous snakes that had broken out among the
  Israelites as a punishment for sin. The bronze snake is mentioned
  again in 2 Kings 18; however, rather than remaining a memorial of
  God's providence, it became an idol that the people named and
  worshiped. Thus the bronze snake was destroyed in King Hezekiah's
  reforms.


More specifically in India I see Christians carry idols of Jesus and other biblical  entities with them kiss them and revere them too. Infact they allow the Hindus in the Church and let them perform worship in their way(Like putting incense sticks, offering flowers , foodstuff to the Idol of Jesus etc) as shown below a very common view in India. I studied in a Christian school for 10 years and i am yet to see Christians not doing these things.

I have seen the same on TV and in videos of people venerating the Idol of biblical entities.


",JesusBoughtIslam,https://christianity.stackexchange.com/users/3812,"The whole iconoclastic controversy has raged for thousands of years. In a nutshell, iconoclasts are taking your position, whereas iconodules maintain the position that what Christians do is venerate not worship these images. Muslims obviously are strict iconoclasts, and thus reject any depiction whatsoever. 

Over the centuries, Christian thought has alternated on what artistic representations are. When Cromwell took Power in the 1650s, for example, they went all Iconoclast and started smashing all the icons they could find, not altogether unlike the rebels in Mali or the Taliban in Afghanistan who blew up the Bamuyan Buddhas. 

The Seventh Ecumenical Council in particular weighed in on this, however, declaring that representations of Christ do not infringe on the person of Christ and are thus not idols. Unlike Hinduism where there is a spectrum  of attitude towards what one is doing with, say, a lingam,  there is official ruling, accepted by ""all"" of the  worlds  Christians (at least  by   Catholics, Protestants and orthodox ) that declares this is veneration and not Latreia.  

St. John of Damascus says:


  Concerning the charge of idolatry: Icons are not idols but symbols, therefore when an Orthodox venerates an icon, he is not guilty of idolatry. He is not worshipping the symbol, but merely venerating it. Such veneration is not directed toward wood, or paint or stone, but towards the person depicted. Therefore relative honor is shown to material objects, but worship is due to God alone.
  
  We do not make obeisance to the nature of wood, but we revere and do obeisance to Him who was crucified on the Cross...

Does actual practice sometimes get this wrong? Sure. The nature of syncretism is such that in some cultures, practices bleed across beliefs.

5140,5140,8173,Can a Floating Action Button morph be reverted?,"There are two specific examples in the Android Floating Action Button guidelines that explain how the button can morph into either new buttons, or a toolbar. 


  If the hallmark of the app is adding file types, a floating action
  button can morph into related actions after it is first touched.





  If a floating action button morphs into a toolbar, that toolbar should
  contain related actions. In this example, the button lets the user
  select the media type to add.




After the button has morphed, how does the user revert back to the previous single button mode?

As I understand it, the rest of the UI is not blocked after these buttons have morphed, so it's not clear how the user can hide the new buttons or revert the morphed shape if they decide not to go through with the new action.

Update

This is more commentary than anything else: I just took a look at Drive to find implementation examples and found an Bottom sheet instead of a FAB morph.

2853,2853,4542,"iPhone dock connector problems, with and without accessories","I started to experience problems with my iPhone that seem to be related to the dock connector.

Upon plugging my iPhone into my (officially supported) car stereo, I started to get the message  ""This accessory is not supported by iPhone"" on the screen.  Didn't think much of it as I only use it for charging purposes, and that still worked so I ignored it.  Then I bought a small ANT+ dongle, which is a little accessory you plug into the dock connector to allow your phone to receive data from various health/fitness devices like heart rate monitor, and cycle sensors etc.  It produces the same error message every time I plug it in, and the apps that use the dongle will not recognise it.

The dongle does officially support my hardware and OS level. I've checked that it is not broken by plugging it into an iPhone 5, an iPad 3 and an iPod of some description, none of which showed the error.  The supported apps find the device on the iPad, the iPhone 5 does not have the apps installed but offers to do so as soon as I plug it in, so I know the dongle is working correctly.

In addition to the above, when nothing is plugged into the dock connector, it still occassionally thinks that something is, resulting in a muted phone.  When it's in this state I am not able to hear anything or change any volume settings (music playback or ringer volume) with the physical keys. Going into the Music app shows that it thinks it's outputting the music to the dock connector.

Why is this accessory not working on my iPhone, and how can I get it working?  What causes my iPhone to think that it's docked when it isn't?
",stuffe,https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/9495,"@stuffe came up with a couple of correct solutions based on traditional wisdom, but failed to realize the depth to which Apple will go to obfuscate problems from the user.  It appears that there is a software setpoint for current (or power since the voltage is supposed to be the fixed) below which this state is triggered.

The message: ""This accessory may not be supported"", is due to insufficient power.

I am sure there is/was an Apple engineer could tell you exactly what current threshold triggers it (probable reasoning is adverse affect on battery life), but that is really irrelevant. Here are some things that you can do to correct it.


Clean connections.  Crud on connectors act as an insulator, reducing
the amount of current flow.
If its a usb cable, plug it in to something with a higher current (amps/milliamps) or power (watts/milliwatts) rating.*
Turn off, power saving features that may reduce power to usb ports. (if it stops after X minutes this is probably the reason)
Make sure your usb adapter outputs sufficient Volts (indicated by it only charging to XX% before you get the message)
Use a usb port closer to your laptop's the power supply (They often
handle more current than easier to access ones)
If you have one, you can try a powered usb hub (good ones are better
with high powered devices)
If none of that works, try a known working cable from a someone.
If that doesn't work you may have an issue with the connector in the
phone itself.


Usb power adapters should have the design voltage and current printed on them; however, this is the ""design"" rating.  Not all of them actually perform to spec in real life and it is not uncommon for components to weaken or fail over time, but still have some output.



Footnote:

I have an ASUS laptop running Linux and it has an easy to access usb port on the right  hand side near the front that doesn't output quite enough power.  Combined with a bit of connector corrosion, the only way it would charge was if I held it down fairly tightly on the charging base.  As soon as I would let go, I would get ""This accessory may not be supported"".  Simply switching it to the usb port near my power connector (in a less convenient location) was sufficient.  This tells me that it likely has nothing to do with any ""device"" specifics and since I have no iApps installed, those are ruled out too.  The only difference is the power output.  I will probably eventually need to clean my connections, but for now I'm good.

It's probably in errno.h and strerror.h depending on how far they have gotten from their BSD roots (just add something like ELOWPWR and ""This accessory has insufficient power for charging."" respectively).

730,730,1162,"GIN/GiST Full Text searches through openlayers, geoserver and postgres","I have a a web app that automatically maps recent tweets and allows you to search for certain keywords. it uses Postgres for the database, geoserver as the server, and openlayers as the cartographic library. Right now tweet keywords are done using the ILIKE query.

This works pretty well if the keyword i'm looking for is a commonly used word, like 'love' , 'friend', 'OMG', etc. but less common words like ""geospatial"" need to search through a lot more data in order to find the last n instances of the word. This is dead slow.

To combat my slowness I'm building a GIN index on my tweet field in postgres. Two days later and i'm still waiting for the index to complete. Once it's built though, I'll try a few queries using SQL view parameters and hopefully this will dramatically speed things up.

Even if this approach works though, it's not going to be all that useful if the index takes so long to create -- the maintenance of it will not be able to keep up will the incoming flood of data. I think I will try out the GiST index next and see how long it takes as I understand it is much faster to this build index. 

Beyond this, what can I do next? Do options like Solr work with Geoserver?? Are there any common approaches to this type of problem and data size/rate?

To refresh the battery turn off all power saving functions (especially standby/hibernate) and unplug the power. Let the battery drain - sometimes running a DVD can help speed this along.

566,566,889,Tripod Head for GigaPan Epic Pro,"I get massively confused when it comes to tripod heads screw sizes blah de blah, so excuse the possible simplicity of this question. I have a GigaPan Epic Pro and a Manfrotto 475B Pro Geared Tripod. I also have a 2 way tilt head that came with my Monopod which I am currently using as the head for this tripod as well. 

Problem is that this head doesn't seem the most stable to place the massive GigaPan unit on with a Nikon D4 and a 400mm lens (all in all a damn heavy setup!). The GigaPan unit has what I call the 'normal' screw (or is it a thread?) which is the same one you get in the bottom of almost every camera known to man these days (like I said, I'm useless when it comes to this stuff). The tripod has the 'big' screw (thread?) that the heads screw in to. This is all pretty normal. Here are my questions;

1- What are these screws/threads actually called, I've seen 1/4 inch and 3/8 inch thrown around a lot and I'd guess that 1/4 inch is the 'normal' one and the 3/8 the 'big' one?

2 - For the GigaPan I'd ideally place it straight onto the 'big' screw, obviously this is not possible, but would this Manfrotto 120 3/8 to 1/4 inch Adaptor be pretty much what I am after.

These might seem very simple questions but trust me, I consider myself a pretty decent photographer but when it comes to this I really struggle to get my head around it.

Thanks!

The GigaPan Epic Pro has the standard 1/4-20 tripod screw at the bottom. You can read more about that here: Is there a standard tripod mount? 

My assumption is that GigaPan included this standard screw so you can mount the camera to a non proprietary setup. If they chose any other screw, they would either have to engage head manufacturers to develop custom quick release brackets, or create their own heads. 

I know that one option you brought up would be to mount legs directly to the GigaPan. I think that this might cause you issues.

1681,1681,2656,Calculating pH of diprotic and amphoteric solutions,"I am trying to understand this problem and its corresponding solution (complete solution not shown)





First off, from the above one can see that the equilibrium constants when $\ce{H2ASO4-}$ donates and receives a proton are as follows:
\begin{aligned}
\ce{H2AsO4 &amp;&lt;=&gt; HAsO4^{2-} + H+} &amp; K_2 &amp;= 1.1 \cdot 10^{−7}\\
\ce{H2AsO4- + H+ &amp;&lt;=&gt; H3AsO4}    &amp; K_{-1} &amp;= 1.6 \cdot 10^{2}\\
\end{aligned}

However, if this is an amphoteric substance as the solution claims, shouldn't both $K_a$ values be comparable? It seems logical that if it is able to act as both an acid and a base, the equilibrium constants should at least be similar to each other. Instead, one is several order of magnitudes larger than the other? Why can this be true and $\ce{H2ASO4-}$ still be an amphoteric substance?



Next, how did they arrive at the statement


  We approximately have the equality relation: $$\ce{[H3AsO4]} = \ce{[HAsO4^{2−}]}$$


What is the evidence that shows this to be true? Isn't the $K_a$ value of the basic reaction ($1.6 \times 10^2$) much larger than that of the acidic reaction? Why should the concentrations be equal?



Finally, let's say you are calculating the pH for the diprotic substance $\ce{H2S}$, which undergoes the following diassociations:

$$\ce{H2S &lt;=&gt; H+ + HS-}$$
$$\ce{HS- &lt;=&gt; H+ + S^{2-}}$$

To find the pH you would assume that the first reaction is dominant, and that the effects of the second reaction consuming $\ce{HS-}$ are minimal, and then calculate the pH from there — right? 

However, why can't you treat $\ce{HS-}$ as an amphoteric substance (because it can both gain and lose a proton) and then calculate the pH as you would for an amphoteric substance (as seen in the image at the beginning)?
",1110101001,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/users/2142,"
  First, I have read that $\ce{H2AsO4-}$ is a amphiprotic substances in
  that the dominant reactivity is $$\ce{2H2AsO4- &lt;=&gt; H3AsO4 + HAsO4^{2-}}$$
  
  However, this also seems to be a polyprotic substance. 


The two terms - amphiprotic and polyprotic - aren't mutually exclusive. Amphiprotic substances can simply behave as both Bronsted-Lowry acids and bases in that they can both give up and release hydrogen protons. 

Polyprotic acids have multiple protons to donate. For example, phosphoric acid is triprotic.  

Often times amphiprotic substances will be polyprotic. By nature of being able to lose multiple protons, these substances are also able to gain multiple protons. 


  Why is one $K_a$ value so much larger than the other? If this were a
  amphoteric substance shouldn't the $K_a$ values for both be
  comparable?


Good observation. This lies with Coulomb's law. Think about it. A neutral molecule kicks off a hydrogen proton. Now you have the first conjugate base. The first conjugate base is negatively charged. It also attempts to kick off a proton. Which do you think is easier? Clearly the first process is. Remember that oppositely charged particles attract. This explains why $K_{a1}$ values for polyprotic molecular acids are generally significantly larger than corresponding $K_{a2}$ values. 

Just because the $K_a$ values differ by several orders of magnitude doesn't mean the ion/molecule can't be amphiprotic. 


  Next, I researched how to calculate the $\mathrm{pH}$ value for
  amphiprotic substances, and I found this page that details how to
  do so, and the end result is that the $\mathrm{pH} = \sqrt{K_1 K_2}$.
  Why is the $\mathrm{pH}$ independent of the concentrations?


First, amphiprotic substances don't have $\mathrm{pH}$ values by themselves. In solution, then yes. 


  Further, I also found another page that gets to the same result in a
  different manner. They start by saying:
  
  
    We approximately have the equality relation: $$\ce{[H3AsO4]} = \ce{[HAsO4^{2−}]}$$
  


Regarding the validity of the quoted statement: just note the main reaction stoichiometry. And the magnitude of the main reaction's K. The main K can be found through dividing the Ka of the reactant acid by the Ka of the product acid. 

\begin{aligned}
\ce{H2AsO4^{−} + H2AsO4^{−} &amp;&lt;=&gt; H3AsO4 + HAsO4^2-}\\
K_\mathrm{rxn} &amp;= \frac{K_a(\ce{H2AsO4^{−}})}{K_a(\ce{H3AsO4})}\\

  Next, why can't this method of calculating pH in amphoteric acids be
  used for diprotic acids? I found another page that details how to do
  so but even though the reactions are essentially similar to those for
  amphiprotic acids, the end result is different. Why does the same line
  of reasoning as used for deriving the formula for amphoteric
  substances fail for diprotic/polyprotic acids?


For diprotic acid, just keep $K$ value magnitudes in mind. This statement applies to diprotic and polyprotic acids:

974,974,1543,Where can I eat dishes that feature in western countries' Chinese restaurants?,"... apart from western countries like the Australia or the USA themselves.

During my visit to Taiwan, I wasn't able to find the dishes I'd typically encounter in a Chinese restaurant in Australia or the United States, such as sweet and sour pork, honey chicken, Mongolian lamb/beef, and fried ice cream.

I have two main theories on why this is. One is that Chinese restaurant food is totally made up, and has no similarity with food anywhere in the world. In which case, I'd better give up trying to find the right location. This seems to be the case with fried ice cream, which Wikipedia suggests is an artificial modern invention.

The other is that maybe I visited the wrong location. China is a big place, after all. Perhaps visiting another area, such as Inner Mongolia, would find me what I'm looking for, with dishes either the same as, or the un-modified version of what is served in western countries' Chinese restaurants.

The Wikipedia article on Chinese restaurant mentions:


  There has additionally been a consequential component of Chinese
  emigration of illegal origin, most notably Fuzhou people from Fujian
  Province and Wenzhounese from Zhejiang Province in Mainland China,
  specifically destined to work in Chinese restaurants in New York City,
  beginning in the 1980s.


As Fujian province is right next to Taiwan, and has had a major influence on it, it seems plausible that if some of the ""Chinese restaurant"" dishes were coming from Fujian, I would have seen them in Taiwan, but I didn't.

Where, if anywhere, can I find the dishes that feature in western countries' Chinese restaurants? Also, how should I identify the right kind of eatery in those countries?

2927,2927,4659,"Good travel games for two players, especially for playing on trains?","I would be interested to hear if anyone had recommendations for 2-player games that are particularly suitable for playing while travelling on trains.  (I ask this as someone who mostly enjoys games like Carcassonne, Power Grid, Agricola, Pandemic, etc. around the table at home.)  To be specific, the things that I think are important properties for these games are:


Needing minimal table space.  Most trains have a small table you could use, but not much more.
Being quiet to play, so that other passengers won't be disturbed.  For example, I imagine that games that involve repeatedly rolling dice wouldn't be appreciated.
Packing down small, so that they don't take up much luggage space.
Not requiring batteries or a power socket.  (I appreciate that an iPhone or a Nintendo DS for each player might be a good solution more generally, but it's not what I'm after in this case.)
Not being so delicate to arrange that motion from the train will unduly disrupt the play.


I think it would be best to recommend one game (or class of games) per answer, if that's appropriate, and explain why you think it's particularly suitable.  (Incidentally, I've read the guidance on good questions about game recommendations and hope this question meets the criteria.)

2803,2803,4468,Delete un-seen mesh with Blender,"I am wondering if there is a way to delete un-seen mesh with Blender. Here's an example. I have a cube, and it has 3 cubes inside of that cube.



Is there a way to delete the mesh inside of the cube without selecting the cubes manually? This would clear up lots of extra mesh and speed up my render engine. I am using Cycles, so if Cycles has an option to not render hidden meshes, that would be good too. (although deleting them would be better). A Python script would also do. :)

Thanks!

935,935,1485,"Good travel games for two players, especially for playing on trains?","I would be interested to hear if anyone had recommendations for 2-player games that are particularly suitable for playing while travelling on trains.  (I ask this as someone who mostly enjoys games like Carcassonne, Power Grid, Agricola, Pandemic, etc. around the table at home.)  To be specific, the things that I think are important properties for these games are:


Needing minimal table space.  Most trains have a small table you could use, but not much more.
Being quiet to play, so that other passengers won't be disturbed.  For example, I imagine that games that involve repeatedly rolling dice wouldn't be appreciated.
Packing down small, so that they don't take up much luggage space.
Not requiring batteries or a power socket.  (I appreciate that an iPhone or a Nintendo DS for each player might be a good solution more generally, but it's not what I'm after in this case.)
Not being so delicate to arrange that motion from the train will unduly disrupt the play.


I think it would be best to recommend one game (or class of games) per answer, if that's appropriate, and explain why you think it's particularly suitable.  (Incidentally, I've read the guidance on good questions about game recommendations and hope this question meets the criteria.)

Update: Thanks for so many excellent suggestions - we certainly won't be short of games for our next long train journey :)

Update 2: Unfortunately, I can't really playtest this many great games in any reasonable time period, so I'm going to accept the top-voted answer (Cribbage) and try out the others as soon as I can.  Thanks again...

1610,1610,2528,Why is it best to use a prime number as a mod in a hashing function?,"If I have a list of key values from 1 to 100 and I want to organize them in an array of 11 buckets, I've been taught to form a mod function

$$ H = k \bmod \ 11$$

Let's say I decided to be a bad boy and use a non-prime as my hashing function - take 12.
Using the Hashing function

$$ H = k \bmod \ 12$$

would result in a hash table with values $0, 12, 24 \dots $ in the first bucket, $1, 13, 25 \dots$ etc. in the second and so on.

If many of your keys have the form $a+k\cdot b$ and your hash function is $H(n)=n \bmod m$, then these keys go to a small subset of the buckets iff $b$ divides $n$. So you should minimize the number of such $b$, which can be achieved by choosing a prime.

1990,1990,3172,Is there a comprehensive life science techniques/methods database?,"There are so many techniques/methodologies in the life sciences that we can use to interrogate interesting questions. The thing is, most of us are completely unaware of the available methods we can employ. Rather, we go with the techniques we are familiar with or that are popular in our subdomains at the time. But that's pretty limiting.

So I'm wondering... we have databases for everything else... is there one for life sciences techniques/methods? Something like this could be immensely helpful in experimental planning. In particular, I think a comprehensive database would help scientists break outside of their spheres of familiarity and to employ less known (but potentially illuminating) methods to their questions.

I know there are journals that publish protocols and methods, but they are fragmented and don't encompass everything.

5979,5979,9480,Creating a Bridged Network Connection in Terminal,"Okay, I'm struggling a bit here. I'm not all that good with Terminal and sorting out network issues using it but I've managed to scrape by so far.

Without using Internet Sharing (because controlling that via Terminal as per my question here doesn't actually seem to work in Yosemite) how can I share my internet connection from one interface (lets say en0) to another (again, lets say en1)?

I kind of understand that Internet Sharing creates a bridge (usually called bridge100) and then uses bootpd (I think) to establish a DHCP server and NAT to route all traffic from 192.168.2.xxx (which is the bridged network) through to your primary network.

How can I get the same result without using the Sharing pref pane?

Now set up the clients with a fixed IP/netmask/Gateway (the internal IP-address of the briding machine)/DNS or properly set up a DHCP server on the bridging machine.

575,575,899,"When and why will an OS initialise memory to 0xCD, 0xDD, etc. on malloc/free/new/delete?","I know that the OS will sometimes initialise memory with certain patterns such as 0xCD and 0xDD.  What I want to know is when and why this happens.

When

Is this specific to the compiler used?

Do malloc/new and free/delete work in the same way with regard to this?

Is it platform specific?

Will it occur on other operating systems, such as Linux or VxWorks?

Why

My understanding is this only occurs in Win32 debug configuration, and it is used to detect memory overruns and to help the compiler catch exceptions.

Can you give any practical examples as to how this initialisation is useful?

I remember reading something (maybe in Code Complete 2) that it is good to initialise memory to a known pattern when allocating it, and certain patterns will trigger interrupts in Win32 which will result in exceptions showing in the debugger.

How portable is this?

IP restrictions means that your server will refuse to pursue connections which are tagged with the wrong IP address. This does not protect the data against eavesdroppers.

Let me take an analogy: suppose that your connections are good old letters, with a destination address, and a sender address. The envelopes are transparent.

But nobody guarantees that the sender address written on the envelope is genuine; sending a letter with a fake sender address is easy. Of course, if I, an attacker, send a letter with your address as alleged sender, I won't see the response (unless I plunder your mailbox).

3117,3117,4965,Shape of rotating rope (lasso problem?),"Let's take a wire or a rope. I usually do this with a chain or my scarf.

I fixate one end in my hand and apply rotation (by subtle movements of this endpoint like spinning a lasso). The rope gets into rotation and obtains certain bent shape:


Some part is missing because cellphone cameras ain't great for high-speed photos but I hope you can imagine all the scarf.

The question is: how can I calculate/predict this shape?

Although this problem doesn't seem that bizarre, I have never seen any solution. Nor I have found this question asked anywhere on internet... Must be because I just don't know how to formulate it without pictures.

Also by taking longer rope I get more than one bend:


I apoligize for the quality again. It is even harder to rotate this while taking picture. The form is not spiral, it is more like a shape in a plane that's rotating.

I'll be thankful for explanations, solutions, links or at least a correct formulation of this problem.
",Džuris,https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/12727,"It's an interesting problem. I've tried to study it neglecting the air friction, which is likely to be nonnegligible. So let's parametrize the rope of length $L$ by the vector $(z(l), r(l))$, with $l$ being the curviligne coordinate along the rope and $(z,r)$ the cylindrical coordinates of the rope (I've omitted $\theta$, which can be assumed to be constant in the rotating frame [see my comment below this post for a justification of this omission]). 
In the rotating frame, the potential energy of the rope is
$$E_p=\int_0^L \mu dl\left(gz-\frac12\Omega^2r^2\right)$$
and the definition of the curviligne integral gives the constraint $r&#39;^2+l&#39;^2=1$. So the problem can be translated into minimizing the following quantity :
$$\begin{align}
 \int_0^Ldl \mathcal L(z,r;z&#39;,r&#39;;l) &amp; &amp;
 \text{with } \mathcal L(z,r;z&#39;,r&#39;;l)=\mu gz - \tfrac12\mu\Omega^2r^2 - \lambda(z&#39;^2+r&#39;^2).
\end{align}$$
One should not forget (as I did in a first tentative answer) that the Lagrange multiplier $\lambda$ depends on $l$/
It is a standard Euler-Lagrange problem and its solution is given by
$$\begin{align}
 \frac{\partial\mathcal L}{\partial z}-\frac{d}{dl}\frac{\partial\mathcal L}{\partial z}&amp;=0&amp;
&amp;\text{and}&amp;
 \frac{\partial\mathcal L}{\partial r}-\frac{d}{dl}\frac{\partial\mathcal L}{\partial r}&amp;=0&amp;
\end{align}$$
The equation in $z$ becomes
$$\begin{align}
\mu g&amp;=-2\frac{d}{dl}(\lambda z&#39;)&amp;
\lambda z&#39;&amp;= -\tfrac12 \mu g(l-l_0),
\end{align}$$
where $l_0$ is an integration constant. For the optimal solution $z&#39;\le 0$, since replacing $z&#39; by -|z&#39;|$ can only decrease $\mathcal L$, ans we have $z&#39;=-\sqrt{1-r&#39;^2}$. One has therefore
$$\lambda=\frac{\mu g(l-l_0)}{2\sqrt{1-r&#39;^2}}$$.
The equation in $r$ is then
$$-\mu\Omega^2r=-2\frac{d}{dl}(\lambda r&#39;) =-\frac{d}{dl}\frac{\mu g(l-l_0)r&#39;}{\sqrt{1-r&#39;^2}}$$
We have then the following equation to integrate
$$0=\frac{\Omega^2}{g}r(1-r&#39;^2)^{3/2}-r&#39;(1-r&#39;^2)-(l-l_0)r&#39;&#39;.$$
I don't know how to integrate it analytically, but when $l-l_0&lt;0$, it seems that we can have oscillations.

Edited to add :

If one looks at the signs of $r&#39;$ and $r&#39;&#39;$ as function of $r$ and $r&#39;$ for a fixed $l$, one can quickly draw some arrows in phase space (i.e.) and see that the flow goes ""in circles"" when $l&lt;l_0$ and tends asymptotically to the curve $\frac{\Omega^2}{g}r=\frac{r&#39;}{\sqrt{1-r&#39;^2}}$ when $l&gt;l0$. So one can expect a finite number of oscillations of the rope. But the whole question is then how $l_0$ relates to the parameters of the system.

Edit: In the limit of almost vertical rope ($r'\ll1$), the equation becomes
$$0=\frac{\Omega^2}{g}r-r&#39;-(l-l_0)r&#39;&#39;$$

So where exactly lies the difference between those two sets of L-functions?
Thanks in advance.
",Sylvain JULIEN,https://mathoverflow.net/users/13625,"The essential answer has already been given but here are a few extra thoughts.

Artin L-functions are defined from a representation of a Galois group on a compex vector space, wheras Hasse--Weil (which are motivic) L-functions are defined by a Galois action on an l-adic one. In the former case, for topological reasons a complex representation of the infinite Galois group Gal$(\overline{\mathbb{Q}}/\mathbb{Q})$ factors through the Galois group of a finite extension $K/\mathbb{Q}$. This is not so for the $l$-adic representations. Hasse--Weil $L$-functions, much like Artin's, are expected to be the $L$-functions of cuspidal automorphic representations.

I notice you query the word ""cuspidal"" in your question. There are automorphic forms, such as Eisenstein series, which are not cuspidal. Basically this means there is a non-zero constant term in the Fourier expansion. This constant term is closely related to a pole of the $L$-function. To see this, all one needs is Mellin inversion and the residue theorem. Artin $L$-functions can be easily proved meromorphic, as a simple application of the Brauer induction theorem, but they are expected to moreover be holomorphic, and this is not known in generality. This holomorphy is crucial in the application of the so-called converse theorems which would give automorphy of Artin $L$-functions.

1027,1027,1618,Is there any significant ranking penalty for using 302 redirects to force HTTPS?,"We have a site with:


Decent ranking on certain targeted keywords.
An HTTPS-only policy, which uses 302 redirects to force clients onto the secure version of any URL.
Internal links using HTTPS, so there is no redirection.
Some, but not all, external links from other domains use HTTPS. The rest do not and will of course be subject to the 302.
Google is only indexing the HTTPS version of each URL. Even if you search specifically for the HTTP URL, only the HTTPS URL is shown in the results.


Will there be any significant, immediate ranking benefit to changing our site to use 301 redirects to enforce HTTPS? Are there any statements from Google, Matt Cutts or other authorities on this specific situation?

Based on my research the difference should be minimal since we are already well indexed, and our internal links are fine, so Google is not going to apply a sitewide penalty for the 302s, which are, in effect, only the first link in the chain.
",Jordan Rieger,https://webmasters.stackexchange.com/users/27841,"The problem with 302 redirects are that they are temporary, which often results in both pages being indexed in Google - The page you are redirecting from and the page you are redirecting to. If both pages are indexed in Google then that is problem as you have a duplicate page indexed.

  302 (Moved temporarily). This code is similar to a 301 in that for a GET or HEAD request, it
  automatically forwards the requestor to a different location, but you
  shouldn't use it to tell the Googlebot that a page or site has moved

So although you mention all your internal linking will use https, but external links inevitably will be with http, so Google is going to find some http links and 302 redirects, which could result in duplicate pages being indexed.

749,749,1185,"On surjections, idempotence and axiom of choice","The following assertion is trivial in ZFC, or even in much weaker theories. Is it also true in ZF?

(I couldn't find it in the Consequences site so far.)


  If $A$ is an infinite set such that $A$ can be mapped onto $A\times 2$ then $|A\times 2|=|A|$


The problem is that we cannot necessarily choose from every fiber of $f$, so we cannot construct an injection from $A$ to $f^{-1}(A\times\lbrace 0\rbrace)$, which will prove the assertion.

While I'm on the topic, is it possible for a D-finite set to have such property? It is possible for a D-finite set to be surjected onto a larger set than itself, but what about that large?
",Asaf Karagila,https://mathoverflow.net/users/7206,"The answer is no. 

First, I argue that it is consistent with ZF that a Dedekind
finite set $A$ can map onto $A\times 2$, and much more.

To see this, begin with any infinite Dedekind finite set $B\subset 2^\omega$, which is furthermore dense in the sense that any finite binary sequence has extensions in $B$. It is consistent with ZF that such a dense set $B$ exists, since in fact the usual symmetric-model arguments produce infinite Dedekind-finite sets that are dense.

Let $A$ consist of the finite non-repeating sequences from
$B$. Note that $A$ is still Dedekind finite, since any countably
infinite subset of $A$ can be used to produce a countably infinite
subset of $B$. Moreover, I claim that $A$ surjects onto
$A\times 2$ and indeed, onto $A^{{\lt}\omega}$. 

To see that $A$ surjects onto $A\times 2$, given $a=\langle b_0,\ldots,b_n\rangle\in A$, let $j$ be the first bit of $b_0$ and define $f(a)=(\langle b_1,\ldots,b_n\rangle,j)$. This is onto, since given any $(\langle b_1,\ldots,b_n\rangle,j)$, we just adjoin $b_0$ starting with digit $j$ to form $a=\langle b_0,\ldots b_n\rangle$, which maps to the original pair. 

For fun, let me show somewhat more, namely, that $A$ actually surjects onto $A^{{\lt}\omega}$. I shall define a function $f:A\to A^{{\lt}\omega}$ as follows. Suppose that we are given $a=\langle
b_0,\ldots,b_n\rangle\in A$. In order to define $f(a)$, we look at a certain finite initial segment of $b_0$, which we take to code a number $k$ and maps $\pi_i:n_i\to n$ for $i\lt k$. This can be coded in some canonical way, whose details are not important. (For example, perhaps $b_0$ starts with $k$ many $0$s, and after this there are $k$ blocks of $1$s, with the $i^{th}$ block of length $n_i$, and after this the bits are given to define the maps $\pi_i:n_i\to n$.) We use these maps to assemble $f(a)$ from the rest of the reals $b_1,\ldots,b_n$. Specifically, let $f(a)=\langle
\vec x_0,\ldots,\vec x_k\rangle\in A$, where $\vec x_i=\langle
b_{\pi_i(0)},\ldots,b_{\pi_i(n_i-1)}\rangle$. That is, each $\vec x_i$ enumerates a subset of $b_1,\ldots b_n$ in the order specified by $\pi_i$. In summary, a finite part of $b_0$ tells us how to assemble $f(a)$ according to a definite procedure from the other reals $b_1,\ldots,b_n$ appearing in $a$. (And if $b_0$ happens not to code things correctly, then we default to some constant value.) This defines $f:A\to A^{{\lt}\omega}$ without using the axiom of choice.
Furthermore, the map is surjective, since for any finite sequence
of injective tuples $\langle \vec x_0,\dots,\vec x_k\rangle$ from $B$, we may consider the reals appearing in those tuples and enumerate them $b_1,\ldots,b_n$, deleting repetitions, and then assemble a suitable $b_0$, using the fact that $B$ is dense in order to know that our desired collection of maps $\pi_i$ for $i\lt k$, which is coded by some finite binary sequence, can be extended to an element $b_0\in B$. It follows that $f(b_0,b_1,\ldots,b_n)$ is exactly the desired sequence of tuples. This surjectivity argument does not use the axiom of choice. 

In summary, $A$ surjects onto $A\times 2$ and even $A^{{\lt}\omega}$, but it is not bijective with $A\times 2$ or indeed with any superset of $A$, since it is Dedekind finite.

Thus, one cannot deduce in ZF that $A$ is bijective with $A\times 2$, just from knowing that it surjects onto $A\times 2$. This is true even when $A$ is a set of reals, since the example provided above has a bijection to a set of reals.

5551,5551,8818,"Good travel games for two players, especially for playing on trains?","I would be interested to hear if anyone had recommendations for 2-player games that are particularly suitable for playing while travelling on trains.  (I ask this as someone who mostly enjoys games like Carcassonne, Power Grid, Agricola, Pandemic, etc. around the table at home.)  To be specific, the things that I think are important properties for these games are:


Needing minimal table space.  Most trains have a small table you could use, but not much more.
Being quiet to play, so that other passengers won't be disturbed.  For example, I imagine that games that involve repeatedly rolling dice wouldn't be appreciated.
Packing down small, so that they don't take up much luggage space.
Not requiring batteries or a power socket.  (I appreciate that an iPhone or a Nintendo DS for each player might be a good solution more generally, but it's not what I'm after in this case.)
Not being so delicate to arrange that motion from the train will unduly disrupt the play.


I think it would be best to recommend one game (or class of games) per answer, if that's appropriate, and explain why you think it's particularly suitable.  (Incidentally, I've read the guidance on good questions about game recommendations and hope this question meets the criteria.)

Update: Thanks for so many excellent suggestions - we certainly won't be short of games for our next long train journey :)

Update 2: Unfortunately, I can't really playtest this many great games in any reasonable time period, so I'm going to accept the top-voted answer (Cribbage) and try out the others as soon as I can.  Thanks again...

4390,4390,6979,Need help with a subsets problem,"With the set $X=\{1,2,...,n\}$, How many subsets of $X$ contain $1$? How many subsets of $X$ don't contain $1$?

My work: 
I know a set with $n$ elements has $2^n$ subsets. The way I tackled this problem was to make a finite set like {1,2,3} and tried to make some generalization from it. I made a decision tree diagram to figure out the different subsets. 

If $1$ was contained in the subset, then the different subsets with $1$ would be:
$$\{1,2,3\},\{1,2\},\{1,3\},\{1\} $$ 
which made me think there are four subsets. $2^n = 4$ which means $n=2$ but there are 3 elements in here so I generalized it as:
$$2^{n-1}$$
where $n \ge 1$ such that $n \in N $ is how many subsets of X that contain $1$.

And for the subsets of $X$ that don't contain $1$, the answer should come out the same as the previous question because, again, if I were to make a finite set like $\{1,2,3\}$, then the subsets without $1$ would be:
$$\{2,3\}, \{2\}, \{3\},  \{\emptyset\}  $$

which is also, $$2^{n-1}$$
where $n \ge 1$ such that $n \in N $ is how many subsets of X that don't contain $1$.

110,110,178,How was the sword of Gryffindor pulled from the hat a second time?,"Spoilers follow, and this is from the books (not the movies)...

In The Chamber of Secrets:


   Harry retrieves Goderic Gryffindor's sword from the sorting hat during the confrontation with the basilisk. After this Dumbledore keeps hold of the sword in a glass case in his office. 


Then in The Deathly Hallows:


   Harry and Ron do a deal with Griphook to return Gryffindor's sword to the goblins after they have retrieved Hufflepuff's cup, planning to partially double cross him by holding on to it until all the horcruxes have been destroyed. However Griphook double crosses them first, and keeps hold of the sword.


Then, in the battle at the end of the book:


   Voldemort puts the sorting hat on Neville Longbottom's head and sets him on fire. Instead of burning Neville pulls Gryffindor's sword out of the sorting hat and beheads Nagini, destroying Voldemort's last horcrux.


However, if the sword could always be pulled out of the hat by someone sufficiently heroic then why the need to:


   Create a copy of the sword to fool Bellatrix Lestrange into thinking she had the real one in Gringott's vault? Why forge a copy and risk Snape placing it in the lake if it could always have been pulled from the sorting hat, regardless of where it was or how it was protected?


How was Gryffindor's sword pulled from the hat the second time? Surely it was beyond the reach of accio or any other charms once returned to its goblin creators?
",Keith,https://scifi.stackexchange.com/users/2154,"In Chamber of Secrets, page 320, chapter 17:


   A gleaming silver sword had APPEARED inside the hat... 


Also in CoS, page 334, chapter 18:


   ""Only a true Gryffindor could have PULLED that out of the hat, Harry"" (Dumbledore to Harry)


In Deathly Hallows, page 689, chapter 23:


   ""Now, Severus, the sword!  Do not forget that it must be taken under conditions of NEED and VALOR...""


(The emphasis is mine)

The short answer is that the magic of the sword and the hat worked together to provide the sword to Neville.

It appeared to him since Neville fulfilled all the qualities necessary for the sword to appear in the Sorting Hat:


true Gryffindor:  Sorting Hat put Neville in the house
need:  Neville needed to kill Nagini
valor:  definition of valor is ""strength of mind or spirit that enables a person to encounter danger with firmness"" (Merriam-Webster.com) and I think Neville demonstrated that numerous times

",qub1n,https://meta.stackexchange.com/users/244159,"Usually you do absolutely nothing. Since the ability to comment was introduced, comments have been considered 2nd class citizens, and have no edit history at all (so you can't see what was changed and when and by whom).  

There is virtually no capability to edit comments for regular users, the only exception being the original author of the comment can edit it at will for 5 minutes after it was posted.  You cannot edit anyone else's comment ever, regardless of reputation.

Moderators can edit comments, but this not a common practice and usually only done for serious issues (such as a useful comment that is very rude or offensive).  Small typos or grammar mistakes are often not changed, simply because it would be a full time job for a moderator to worry about cleaning things up.

The best thing to do if you encounter a typo in a comment that potentially can cause confusion is to leave your own comment and ask ""@bobLoblaw do you mean .....?"".

For the kinds of typos, I'm thinking of things such as:


Forgetting a ""not"" or other typo/omission that causes the comment to say something other than what you think it was intended to mean
A serious spelling mistake that changes the meaning of a post 
A significant typo in a code snippet that would have a different result than what is being intended.

Since the ability to comment was introduced, comments have been considered 2nd class citizens, and have no edit history at all (so you can't see what was changed and when and by whom).  

There is virtually no capability to edit comments for regular users, the only exception being the original author of the comment can edit it at will for 5 minutes after it was posted.  You cannot edit anyone else's comment ever, regardless of reputation.

Moderators can edit comments, but this not a common practice and usually only done for serious issues (such as a useful comment that is very rude or offensive).  Small typos or grammar mistakes are often not changed, simply because it would be a full time job for a moderator to worry about cleaning things up.

The best thing to do if you encounter a typo in a comment that potentially can cause confusion is to leave your own comment and ask ""@bobLoblaw do you mean .....?"".

For the kinds of typos, I'm thinking of things such as:


Forgetting a ""not"" or other typo/omission that causes the comment to say something other than what you think it was intended to mean
A serious spelling mistake that changes the meaning of a post 
A significant typo in a code snippet that would have a different result than what is being intended.

In SQL Server Management Studio you have two options for shrink, database or files. Given my situation what would be the best option?
is there a rule on the percentage of free space a DB should have?

3127,3127,4980,"Biscuit, dowel or simple braces for making unit top with inset lid and slim sides?","I've had 5 pieces of iroko machined for creating a top to my DIY TV lift, complete with a lid for the TV to pop up through:



The dimensions are based on the pre-existing cabinet, and the lid size needed for the TV to rise up. I was originally taking my cue from this YouTube video wherein he joins his (very long) pieces with biscuits; however now I have my pieces I'm concerned that:


The two sides are too slim to really hold the whole thing together with any strength (as I imagine I could only use one biscuit on each side);
The boards may be relatively slim (20mm) and as such need small biscuits or dowels, compounding point 1.


Bearing in mind that a) I'm a total novice, and b) I don't own a biscuit-cutter, I was wondering whether a far easier solution might be to use one or two 'braces' (apologies if this is not the correct term) running on the underside of the lid, on either side, joining the front and back pieces and spanning the shorter side pieces. These would be hidden inside the unit once the lid is in place, so it shouldn't affect the look.

Although the top isn't structural, it should still be solid and sound, and most likely need to at least bear the weight of a graceless cat who will hurl his body at any piece of furniture like a sack of potatoes.

TL;DR Illustrations

Biscuits:

Braces:

",indextwo,https://diy.stackexchange.com/users/12154,"Honestly for solid wood boards (hardwood in your case) just applying wood glue and clamping would provide more than sufficient strength to hold the weight of a cat. Simple glue joints are used to make table tops without additional fasteners. The strength of the glue joint is generally stronger than the wood itself and since your boards have already been machined they provide great gluing surfaces. Just don't clamp so hard you squeeze out all the glue.

20mm (a little more than 3/4"") is plenty thick to use most fastening systems including biscuits or dowels. Biscuits you need a special bicuit cutting tool which can be expensive. Dowels benefit from a jig to get them to line up properly. My personal choice is to use pocket screw holes for applications like this. 

A Kreg Mini jig will suffice for your needs as long as you have a power drill and only costs about $13 and you don't need expensive bar clamps as you would with glue alone but a face clamp would benefit to keep everything flush. You can also just use standard quick clamps though. I use mine frequently but there are more advanced models that make positioning easier. I have comparisons of the different Kreg Jig models on my site.

The way I would do it is to drill the pocket screw holes on the undersides of the boards using 3 screws on each side, 1 of which is screwed onto the long board. 2 screws per side would be adequate but I like to have some on the alternate board for glueups like this.

4053,4053,6470,Can symmetry be restored in high energy scattering?,"Suppose you have a field theory with a real scalar field $\phi$ and a potential term of the form $\lambda \phi^4 - \mu \phi^2$ that breaks the symmetry $\phi \to - \phi$ in the ground state. Is this symmetry restored in a scattering with high momentum transfer in any physically meaningful way? My problem is that there is no background field for which I could take a mean field approximation, so the usual argument for phase transitions does not work. 

One thing that came to my mind is that the potential will have higher order corrections, so maybe one could ask which way these corrections work in the limit $\Lambda \to \infty$, where $\Lambda$ is a UV scale? I know the first order correction for small $\phi$ does actually contribute to the breaking rather than to restoration, but then that doesn't seem to be the right limit for the scattering. If you don't know the answer I'd also be grateful for a reference. (Please do not point me to references that are for in-medium effects, nuclear matter etc, as I have plenty of these and it's not addressing my problem.)
",WIMP,https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/1458,"First of all, the vev of $\phi$ scales like a positive power of $\mu$ which has the units of mass. So all the effects of the symmetry breaking scale like a positive power of the mass scale $\mu$. At energies $E$ satisfying $E\gg \mu$, i.e. much higher than $\mu$, the value of $\mu$ itself as well as vev and other things may simply be neglected relatively to $E$: all the corrections from the symmetry breaking go to zero, relatively speaking.

In the UV, i.e. at short distances, the dimensionless couplings (and interactions) such as $\lambda$ are much more important than the positive-mass-dimension dimensionful couplings such as $\mu$.

It's still true that the high-energy theory wasn't exactly symmetric in the treatment above; it was just approximately symmetric. However, in fact, sometimes it is exactly symmetric under the sign flip of $\phi$. That's because the value of $\mu$ runs, as in the renormalization group, and in many interesting theories, $\mu$ actually switches the sign at energies exceeding some critical energy scale $E_0$. So the high energy theory may have a single symmetry-preserving minimum of the potential and the symmetry breaking may be a result of the flow to low energies.

It's legitimate you want to know the higher-loop corrections to the Higgs potential but the subtlety you should appreciate is that all these calculations proceed relatively to some renormalization (mass) scale. If the scale is low, the behavior of the theory at much higher energies may only be deduced by the (inverted) RG flows. However, the deduction of the short-distance theory from its long-distance effective field theory approximation is never exact; it's the high-energy theory that is the legitimate starting point and the low-energy physics is its consequence.

Is this symmetry restored in any physical way in the scattering of high momentum transfer? My problem is, without the background field, I can take the mean field approximation, so the usual phase transition doesn't work.","First of all, the vev of $\phi$ scales like a positive power of $\mu$ which has the units of mass. So all the effects of the symmetry breaking scale like a positive power of the mass scale $\mu$. At energies $E$ satisfying $E\gg \mu$, i.e. much higher than $\mu$, the value of $\mu$ itself as well as vev and other things may simply be neglected relatively to $E$: all the corrections from the symmetry breaking go to zero, relatively speaking.

In the UV, i.e. at short distances, the dimensionless couplings (and interactions) such as $\lambda$ are much more important than the positive-mass-dimension dimensionful couplings such as $\mu$.

5566,5566,8840,Why would analysts recommend buying companies with negative net income?,"Can anyone explain why some analysts recommend companies in the biopharmacy sector as a ""buy"" even though they have high R&amp;D costs and no real profit?

I followed three companies and I see the same story. The only positive number is income, and only in one case does it cover expenses after net borrowing. For the next four in a row, the net income the net income is below zero. 

Why are these companies a buy?
",hephestos,https://money.stackexchange.com/users/2031,"The biotechnology sector as a whole is a popular buy recommendation among some analysts these days for a few reasons. 


Some analysts feel that the high costs in R&amp;D, even without much profit, are a positive sign for growth because it means a company is working towards finding the next ""blockbuster drug"" or the next class of such drugs. There haven't been many new classes of blockbuster drugs since the development of SSRI's and statins, and many of the new drugs that have been developed have been tweaks to existing classes of drugs. Some analysts feel that ""it's about time"" for a new class of blockbuster drugs to hit the market. A new blockbuster drug means significant profits for the company that develops it; a new class of blockbuster drugs means significant profits for the whole industry. 
Since about 2009, the Food and Drug Administration has been more lenient in its approval of new drugs. This wave of new approvals has reduced R&amp;D costs for companies because they don't need to go back to the lab or earlier phases of clinical trials and continually tweak their drugs in order to gain approval. This has also made some analysts optimistic.
Genetic engineering is considered an up-and-coming field with potentially significant applications to the pharmaceutical industry. Advances in this field may increase profits for the pharm industry, but since biotech companies are often the ones producing the engineering equipment, research, etc. such advances could be a major source of revenue for the entire biotech industry. 
In the US and in the developed world as a whole, the elderly population is growing, and since people consume more medicine as they grow older, this could lead to higher profits for companies involved in the production of pharmaceuticals (which includes biotech companies, of course) in the long run. 
In the US, the passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act expanded insurance coverage, which gives more people the means to afford pharmaceuticals. Also, in general, people consume more healthcare services when they have insurance (this is called moral hazard), so some analysts expect that the expansion of insurance coverage will only lead to more profits for the pharmaceutical industry and biotechnology firms in general.
The global food crisis. As the climate changes, companies like Monsanto, which use various forms of genetic engineering to produce crop strains that can survive in increasingly hostile environments, look more and more appealing to places that need crops designed to grow in such environments. Any methods that could increase yields look increasingly popular, and biotechnology companies often market such methods. (As a side note, I know Monsanto is a contentious example, and there are a lot of misconceptions about ""genetically modified food"" and the genetic engineering methods they do, so I won't get into a debate about that). 
In general, technology is a popular subject right now. I've read analyst reports (from analysts that clearly don't follow the biotech sector) that base their forecasts for the biotech sector on the activities of companies like Dell, Zynga, HP, LinkedIn, Facebook, etc. Clearly, it's problematic when an analyst sees the word ""technology"" and automatically assumes that the biotech sector is responsive to the same factors as social media firms, hardware manufacturers, etc. This isn't to say that the biotech sector is completely isolated from this, but when I read a report that talks about Facebook's IPO being bad news for companies like Gilead Sciences without mentioning upcoming FDA decisions about Gilead's products or any biotech-specific factors, I'm not convinced the analyst has performed due diligence. 


I keep using the phrase ""some analysts"" because I want to stress that the opinions stated above aren't universal. Although they're popular, not everyone is so optimistic. Also, I don't want you to see these reasons and think that I'm making a buy recommendation, because I'm not. I'm not making a recommendation one way or another. 

I'm happy to clarify my answer too; I follow the biotechnology sector extensively. If you want to get a rough feel for the daily movements of the sector as a whole, a good place to start is IBB, the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology Index Fund. The four largest holdings are Regeneron, Gilead Sciences, Amgen, and Celgene, which are all big players in the industry (obviously). These are a little different from the big name pharma companies like Pfizer, Merck, Novartis, etc. but they're still considered pharma companies.

It's also worthwhile to follow the FDA press announcements. By the time the news is published there, it's probably already leaked or known to people in the industry (the biotech/pharm sectors are rife with accusations of insider trading), so you might not find trading opportunities, but it's important to get familiar with the information the releases contain if you want to know more about the industry. Volatility trades are always popular trades around FDA drug approvals.

4790,4790,7605,Lead Free Soldering and bad looking joints,"For years I've been soldering with normal Sn60Pb40 solder wire. But now I try to switch to lead free solder. In many forums over the internet I found the Amasan BF32-3 solder wire. It's a Sn95Ag4Cu solder wire with 3.5% flux. 

So I tried it and was very disappointed. Nearly every solder joint was looking different. Some of them were (partially) shiny; some (the most) of them were dull. And the worst thing was, that even with additional flux, the solder didn't flow like the leaded. So there is no way, I could solder fine pith SMD stuff with it.

I’m using a JBC soldering iron station with a C245-907 2.2mm chisel tip and tried different temperatures starting with 290°C to 360°C. The best results I get with about 315°C, with 350°C I got the worst results. I used the Amtech NC-559 Flux – the original, not the fake from china. 

Some other guys told me, that maybe the solder wire is not the best. That's why I'm looking for other soldering wires. But there are so many on market. Some with copper, some are Sn96.5Ag3.5 like the Amtech ASN96A3.5-0.50.

So can someone tell me, with what type of solder wire or what product I can get nice shiny solder joints. And yes, I now that dull joints were not a sign for a bad or even cold joint.

939,939,1489,Can I use Ubuntu to diagnose hard drive or RAM problems in Windows?,"This may be a crazy question, but here goes...

My brother suggested that I could somehow use either a Ubuntu Live Boot CD or Flash drive or Kubuntu as a way to diagnose issues I'm currently having with my laptop. I'm running Windows 7 and for some reason my laptop has suddenly started freezing during Windows start up. This started immediately after I began seeing the hard drive light remaining on and my computer running very, very slowly - even though when I checked Task Manager it said that no applications or unusual processes were running at the time and CPU usage was 0%. Strange, I know.

I've used the Restore disks 3 times already, thinking maybe it was a virus, even though I run Norton 360 and it found nothing upon a full system scan. But every time I end up with Windows failing to start up at all, or it getting stuck on the ""Windows Starting"" screen for at least 15-20 minutes before it starts.

I'm at a total loss here. I'm thinking it is either a Hard drive issue or perhaps a RAM issue, but I am a total moron when it comes to the operational aspect of computers. I don't know where to begin. My brother said that if I used a flash drive of Ubuntu or Kubuntu and tried to boot from there that I would know immediately if it was my Hard drive because it wouldn't operate. I don't understand that since it wouldn't be operating off my hard drive, it would be running from the CD/flash drive.

Does anyone have any clues on what I can do to check this out? I'm tempted to buy a new hard drive and RAM, but would hate to buy something I can't return if they aren't the issue.

I'm stuck...any help would be very appreciated. Thanks so much and have a wonderful weekend.

4702,4702,7455,AES using derived keys / IVs. Does it introduce a weakness?,"I'm looking for an efficient way to encrypt multiple fields in a database with AES using a single global key, used throughout a large web application.

Obviously in order to re-use this key, a unique random IV is required for each field that is to be encrypted.

I'd rather not introduce more fields to the database to store each of these IVs, so the programatic approach seems to be to derive these IVs some how.

I'm toying with using either:

key = sha256(global_key + table_name)
iv = sha256(column_name + primary_key)


Or even simply:

key = global_key
iv = sha256(table_name + column_name + primary_key)


I'm leaning towards the former to generate per-table keys.

I've already read that the IVs do not need to be kept secret. So I'm working on the assumption that a derived key or IV (even if the algorithm becomes known), is no more insecure than any other non-secret IV, as long as the original key remains secret.

The question is:

Is there a fatal flaw in my approach? Am I introducing any serious weaknesses that, in the event that an adversary obtains a copy of the database, would make it easier for them to retrieve the plaintext data?

I realise that is potentially soliciting one word answers.

Suggestions for alternate / better schemes very much welcomed, as well as references to existing works and how they implement similar scenarios.

The interface you are using to create the buffers IFeatureCursorBuffer2 creates buffers for selected features.  Your point that you create based upon the users button click is not a feature but a graphic which you are adding to the graphics container of the map. A Feature is essentially a row in a table or featureclass.

As you are adding your point as a graphic I assume the buffer you want to create will also end up as a graphic. Use the interface ITopologicalOperator and it's method Buffer to create a polygon then do as you did with your point, create a graphic element.

The MOSFET and the diode are going to be isolated from the heatsink. Should I connect the heatsink to the ground via two screws that are shown below?

Should I connect four mounting screws in the corners of the PCB to ground?

I tried to minimize the length of the critical traces but the heatsink didn't allow me too much. In addition to that, I kept the area of these critical traces that can act as an antenna to a minimum -only as big as to carry the currents. Also, I tried to keep output capacitors away from the heatsink as they are electrolytic and they should be away from the heatsink.

It would be great if you can draw the main current loops!





",abdullah kahraman,https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/5035,"Added:  Points raised are being addressed. Have left most in and tidied as example of things to consider and that have now been considered. Added PFET level shift comment at end.
  [This comment is for anyone following this - NOT as an edit trace]. 

You do seem to be trying and have a general grasp of what is needed but, no rudeness intended, the circuit shows several signs of very major lack of design. You need to think things through MUCH more carefully.Fine detail cannot be looked at until you get the basic circuit details correct. As shown it will not work AT ALL for several major reasons. 

Drive polarity wrong:    The IC is able to be configured as a buck converter but as shown the output drive is of the wrong polarity if you use a P Channel high side switch and of the wrong voltage swing if you use an N Channel high side switch - see below. If using a P Channel MOSFET (which would be normal here) the output drive needs an inverter in it. As shown it will not work.

Level translator needed in driver:       If you DO run the IC off a 12V supply (and Vdd max = 15V) then the inverting driver which you have not yet got also needs to level translate as the MOSFET is high side and gate drive needs to go to 30V or whatever for MOSFET turn off. While addressing that do also ensure that MOSFET Vgs max is not exceeded when driving.

FET is wrong type          The MOSFET is nice enough BUT is N Channel (as befits the incorrect topology that you are using). An N channel MOSFET COULD be used there but the gate would need to be driven above V+ rail and you would need a gate drive supply. The overwhelmingly usual thing to do would be to use a P Channel MOSFET as the switch

Output diode      The output diode is very nice but is ""overkill"". The high max voltage leads also to higher than necessary forward operating voltage. You can probably get a few % more efficiency end to end with a lower voltage Schottky.

At a glance without pouring over the details the IC looks competent and should be capable of good efficiency as a buck regulator. I'd expect 90-95% to be achievable once the circuit was correct. 



Driving high side PFET.

Vin max = 32 V (specified).
 Vdd Ic = 12V (user specified) or 15V abs max.

PFET will have a Vgs max. Above that you get magic smoke.
 As PFET source is connected to Vin+ the Vgs is measure relative to Vin+.
 PFET gate can be driven low BELOW Vin+ by Vgsmax - ideally a bit less.

FET's that are not logic FETS often have Vgsmax of 20 to 25V.
 Most FETs are totally ""enhanced"" (aka turned fully on) by the time they have Vgs = 12V - see curves for FET of choice.
 Let's set Vgs max actual   = -12V relative to Vin+.
 This means that when Vin+ = 32V, Vgs may range from about 32V (FET is off) to 32-12 = 20V (FET is hard on).

Have left most in and tidied as example of things to consider and that have now been considered. Added PFET level shift comment at end.
  [This comment is for anyone following this - NOT as an edit trace]. 

You do seem to be trying and have a general grasp of what is needed but, no rudeness intended, the circuit shows several signs of very major lack of design. You need to think things through MUCH more carefully.Fine detail cannot be looked at until you get the basic circuit details correct. As shown it will not work AT ALL for several major reasons. 

Drive polarity wrong:    The IC is able to be configured as a buck converter but as shown the output drive is of the wrong polarity if you use a P Channel high side switch and of the wrong voltage swing if you use an N Channel high side switch - see below. If using a P Channel MOSFET (which would be normal here) the output drive needs an inverter in it. As shown it will not work.

Level translator needed in driver:       If you DO run the IC off a 12V supply (and Vdd max = 15V) then the inverting driver which you have not yet got also needs to level translate as the MOSFET is high side and gate drive needs to go to 30V or whatever for MOSFET turn off. While addressing that do also ensure that MOSFET Vgs max is not exceeded when driving.

FET is wrong type          The MOSFET is nice enough BUT is N Channel (as befits the incorrect topology that you are using). An N channel MOSFET COULD be used there but the gate would need to be driven above V+ rail and you would need a gate drive supply. The overwhelmingly usual thing to do would be to use a P Channel MOSFET as the switch

Output diode      The output diode is very nice but is ""overkill"". The high max voltage leads also to higher than necessary forward operating voltage. You can probably get a few % more efficiency end to end with a lower voltage Schottky.

At a glance without pouring over the details the IC looks competent and should be capable of good efficiency as a buck regulator. I'd expect 90-95% to be achievable once the circuit was correct. 



Driving high side PFET.

Vin max = 32 V (specified).
 Vdd Ic = 12V (user specified) or 15V abs max.

PFET will have a Vgs max. Above that you get magic smoke.
 As PFET source is connected to Vin+ the Vgs is measure relative to Vin+.
 PFET gate can be driven low BELOW Vin+ by Vgsmax - ideally a bit less.

FET's that are not logic FETS often have Vgsmax of 20 to 25V.
 Most FETs are totally ""enhanced"" (aka turned fully on) by the time they have Vgs = 12V - see curves for FET of choice.
 Let's set Vgs max actual   = -12V relative to Vin+.
 This means that when Vin+ = 32V, Vgs may range from about 32V (FET is off) to 32-12 = 20V (FET is hard on).
 BUT available drive voltage at IC = 0-12V approx.
 So a level shifter is definitely needed.

4985,4985,7937,"How to find out the ""serviceability"" of a car?","One of my concerns before purchasing a car is how expensive repairs are going to be down the road. For example my car up until recently was a Volvo 850, and the air conditioner didn't work in it; the cost of getting it fixed was significantly higher than other cars because of the way the A/C unit is installed in the car, so I went on without air conditioning. Another example is the service light in the car - while the car had a standard OBD-II port which could read error messages, it required a special Volvo reader to reset the service light.

I know a lot of generalizations can be made about one make versus another, but those are obviously not allowed on this site (in fact, I hope this question is allowed at all...) - so that's not what I'm looking for. And I know there is a wide range of problems a car can encounter, and many of them are universal - replacing tires, for (a bad) example.

So, just like I can go to KBB and look up the recommended price of a car, is there someplace I can go to look up a make &amp; model of a car and see what proprietary, extra-expensive parts are in the car? Something that, for example, I could have put in the Volvo 850 and it would have told me about those above-mentioned peculiarities alongside undoubtedly a number of other proprietary bits that I didn't have problems with.

4029,4029,6431,"Good travel games for two players, especially for playing on trains?","I would be interested to hear if anyone had recommendations for 2-player games that are particularly suitable for playing while travelling on trains.  (I ask this as someone who mostly enjoys games like Carcassonne, Power Grid, Agricola, Pandemic, etc. around the table at home.)  To be specific, the things that I think are important properties for these games are:


Needing minimal table space.  Most trains have a small table you could use, but not much more.
Being quiet to play, so that other passengers won't be disturbed.  For example, I imagine that games that involve repeatedly rolling dice wouldn't be appreciated.
Packing down small, so that they don't take up much luggage space.
Not requiring batteries or a power socket.  (I appreciate that an iPhone or a Nintendo DS for each player might be a good solution more generally, but it's not what I'm after in this case.)
Not being so delicate to arrange that motion from the train will unduly disrupt the play.


I think it would be best to recommend one game (or class of games) per answer, if that's appropriate, and explain why you think it's particularly suitable.  (Incidentally, I've read the guidance on good questions about game recommendations and hope this question meets the criteria.)

Update: Thanks for so many excellent suggestions - we certainly won't be short of games for our next long train journey :)

668,668,1059,What is the case for interpreting the Genesis creation account literally?,"I think we can all agree that the entire Bible is not meant to be taken literally.  Consider the Song of Solomon (what would his lover look like if we take it literally?) or the book of Revelation.

So I would like to understand the case for believing the Genesis creation account, among all Biblical texts, is one that is intended to be interpreted literally. I'm not interested in scientific evidence for a young-earth in these answers. I'm interested in Biblical or historical reasons why this text, as a whole (as opposed to individual words), should be considered literal.

I would also discourage answers that address specific words in the Genesis account (such as the Hebrew 'yom'), but if that is the strongest evidence you have, then I won't consider it an invalid answer.

",Caius Eugene,https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/users/23581,"You may be confusing some details. A height map is simply a 2D array of data. Each point represents 3 pieces of information: an x and y location and a number to represent the height at that point. For a simpler example, lets look at a 1D array of data that creates some 2D terrain. Each data point here will contain an x location and a number to represent the height at that point:



Pretty simple right? It's just a regular old graph. As you can see, the numbers on the x axis go up by tens. We could easily change that to go up by 100's or by .01's. Same goes for the data displayed on the y axis. We can scale those values however we like.

Basically, it's just numbers until you decide how you're going to visually represent it. So, saying a height map of 64px by 64px is already one step beyond where we need to go. Since a grayscale image is just another way to display the same data as a 3D height map. The data to represent each is coming from the same place.

If I have a plane, such as 64 x 64 vertices, I need to create a gray-scale height map of 64px x 64px, so as to correctly displace the geometry of the plane?","You may be confusing some details. A height map is simply a 2D array of data. Each point represents 3 pieces of information: an x and y location and a number to represent the height at that point. For a simpler example, lets look at a 1D array of data that creates some 2D terrain. Each data point here will contain an x location and a number to represent the height at that point:



Pretty simple right? It's just a regular old graph. As you can see, the numbers on the x axis go up by tens. We could easily change that to go up by 100's or by .01's. Same goes for the data displayed on the y axis. We can scale those values however we like.

Basically, it's just numbers until you decide how you're going to visually represent it. So, saying a height map of 64px by 64px is already one step beyond where we need to go. Since a grayscale image is just another way to display the same data as a 3D height map. The data to represent each is coming from the same place.

I would like to find a presentation of the group $\Gamma=G\cap\mathrm{GL}_n\mathbb Z$.

The entries on the superdiagonal play a crucial role, in that the $n-1$ matrices with a single $1$ on the superdiagonal ($1$s on the diagonal and $0$s elsewhere) generate all of $\Gamma$.

Trying to write down a presentation, I would start by choosing $n-1$ generators, $a_{12},\dotsc,a_{n-1,n}$ (named after the matrix entries). It is also clear that we need commutation relations, like
$$
[\cdots[[[a_{12},a_{23}],[a_{23},a_{34}]],\ldots]\cdots]=\cdots=e.

(If $n=3$, this would just be $[[a_{12},a_{23}],a_{12}]=[[a_{12},a_{23}],a_{23}]=e$.)
I am just not sure, though, if I explicitly need to require that, say,
$$
[a_{12},a_{34}]=e,

Part of me fears that this is some sort of joke hacking attempt (I know of a USB device you plug into someones computer and it randomly moves their mouse and types on their keyboard), but there is nothing plugged into my machine and I just turned off the Wi-Fi and watched as this web page tried to close, the mouse right clicked twice, highlighted a word and clicked ""Paste and Match Style"" in the Chrome right-click menu.
Also as I've been typing (with my Wi-Fi turned off) the mouse has randomly been clicking inside this question and changing where I am typing.  

I just plugged in a USB mouse which seems to work fine but the trackpad is now nearly useless. I can't even move the mouse cursor more than a few centimeters with it.

Is this a common issue?
EDIT
I think it is dying actually. I can now click but not move at all with the trackpad, while a regular mouse works fine.
EDIT 2
And now it seems to be working again. I turned on the option for ""Ignore Trackpad when Mouse is plugged in"" under Universal Access. I cleaned the trackpad with rubbing alcohol, I whined and complained for a few minutes to my dog, turned off the ""Ignore Trackpad"" setting, unplugged the USB mouse, and the Trackpad appears to be working mostly normally.
If I run my finger across it at the top or bottom portion of the mouse, it works, but there is a line horizontally across it (almost exactly where a physical trackpad button would end on the old trackpads) that is ""dead"".  The mouse stops moving, or moves sluggishly when hitting that spot and that ""spot"" goes across the whole trackpad.
",James P. Wright,https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/4049,"This was driving me crazy, too.

My understanding is this only occurs in Win32 debug configuration, and it is used to detect memory overruns and to help the compiler catch exceptions.

Can you give any practical examples as to how this initialisation is useful?

I remember reading something (maybe in Code Complete 2) that it is good to initialise memory to a known pattern when allocating it, and certain patterns will trigger interrupts in Win32 which will result in exceptions showing in the debugger.

1273,1273,2004,Is it worth bringing a flash for a backpacking trip?,"I'm going on my honeymoon to Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam in June for 4 weeks.

I'll bring my Canon t3i + 15-55mm and a 55-250mm lens.

This will be my first travel like this and I definitely want to take some awesome pictures.

I don't have a Flash and I want to buy a Canon Speedlite 430EX when the time comes.

The question is... Is it Worth it to buy this flash for this kind of travel?
",Roberto,https://photo.stackexchange.com/users/16030,"The answer, as usual, is ""it depends"".  It depends on what kind of shots you hope to get, and how you plan to use your camera. Flash is beneficial for shots where there is not enough ambient light and the area to be lit is fairly small. It is also very useful when you need fill or to overcome extremely backlit subjects, such as when you must face the sun or a very bright window.

Flash can be useful indoors, in churches, museums and other such places. However, a flash will do very little to light an entire church, but might be useful for a statue or a few elements of detail you wish to capture. However, many places forbid flashes, as the cumulative light damages artifacts and artwork. So, instead of a flash for indoor travel photography, you would be better off with a tripod, and simply setting the camera on a slower shutter speed to capture your subject.

For fill light, a flash is really useful. Luckily, you have a built-in flash on your t3i, and this works reasonably well for fill. However, it is likely that the 55-250 lens might be long enough to block some of the flash. The 430EX will provide more light, and throw it further than your on-board, and it is positioned higher, so it will likely clear the lens. It also offers a separate focus light, that really aids in getting focus in low light situations. But frankly, a pocket flashlight, shining on your subject during focus does the same.  For fill light, a reflector is a must have, but any white object for reflecting works well in a pinch: t-shirt, magazine, piece of paper.

So, my recommendation is that for travel photography, forget the flash. Buy a tripod instead, put a small flashlight in your pocket, and carry something to use as a reflector.

6047,6047,9596,Another instructor is pushing me out of the classroom right after my class ends,"I am a graduate student in math in my final year, and for several years have been teaching at my department as a lecturer. This semester, in the same lecture hall there is another lecture that starts 20 minutes after my class ends. It's taught by another instructor from my department. I usually have many students coming to office hours and there are also students asking questions immediately after lecture. Due to other activities, I cannot have office hours right after the lecture this semester and can only stay for about 15 minutes to answer questions.

Many times in the past I had a similar situation and never had any issues with it. This semester the instructor who is teaching right after often arrives 20-15 minutes before her class starts and tells me immediately that I have to go with my students somewhere else. 

I make sure to leave the blackboard clean and take all my stuff away from the instructor's desk before she arrives, but I do believe that I have a right to stay in the classroom after my lecture for at least 5-10 minutes. There is no vacant classroom around, and I don't have time to go with students to my office, which is in a different building.

Last time the instructor told me in front of my students that I don't understand ""simple things"" and that I am ""playing games"". When I was talking to one of my students, she stood very close to us and clearly demonstrated that she wanted us out. I tried to explain her that I couldn't go anywhere else due to my time constraints, but she didn't want to listen to me. I really don't understand what ""simple"" things she meant and what ""games"" I am playing. 

We leave the board clean. She doesn't need to set up a projector. She can still talk to her students before her class starts, if she wants to (even though it seems like her students don't ask her any questions before their class). So, I don't see how I cause any disruption. 

I had met this woman many times before this semester, but we never talked. I didn't see her talking to other instructors/students much, and she seems to be quite reserved and a bit neurotic. She doesn't want to have any conversation with me regarding the issue.

I felt really offended after last class when she said those things to me in front of my students. What would you do in my case? 

Added later: There are no official rules regarding classroom occupancy between classes. Instructors are supposed to use common sense and be reasonable. For me using 50% of the break time seems reasonable to answer questions after lecture seems reasonable. I agree that for some people it may not.

I don't block the entrance to the classroom. A few students from the next class who come earlier always go ahead and take their seats as soon as my students start leaving the room. I also had one of the students from the next class listening to my explanation to one of those after-class questions and asking me further questions before their class (which is the same class as I am teaching, just a different section). Maybe the instructor got jealous, I don't know.

The entrance to the classroom is from its front (not back), so I do stay in the front. But it is a big lecture hall, and there is a plenty of space in front of the room (the board itself consists of 8 huge panels).

Also, during my career as a grad.student who is also teaching for the department, I have had several observations from experienced professors who are considered to be great teachers at the department and are in charge of undergraduate teaching policy. In my evaluations the fact that there are always several students approaching me with questions after class considered as very positive, meaning that students find me approachable. 

Thank you everyone for answers. 
",Lidd88,https://academia.stackexchange.com/users/31345,"I would like to provide two suggestions. The first one directly refers to your discussions with students:


  There is no vacant classroom around, and I don't have time to go with students to my office, which is in a different building.


If the questions really need to be answered immediately, you could simply take the discussion outside into the hallway. Surely, most of the students have to or want to leave, anyway, I presume, as they might have to move to different buildings themselves (?)

For anything else, you do not have to ""have office hours right after the lecture"", and you do not have to ""go with students to [your] office"". They are adults. Surely, your students can find out where your office is on their own and come there when you are free.

My second suggestion is related to whether you may stay around in the lecture room after your class:

It generally seems like the most corteous and natural thing to me that once the class has ended, one should try and leave the room as quickly as possible. Unless otherwise regulated by your organisation, I see no basis for the fundamental belief


  I have a right to stay in the classroom after my lecture for at least 5-10 minutes


... unless your departure actually takes that long (e.g. because you have to pack some elaborate experimental setups for a while). At the same time, however, I wouldn't concede the other lecturer any basic right to arrive in the classroom at least 5 - 10 minutes before the next lecture starts, unless some elaborate setup needs to be prepared for that lecture.

In other words: If you are entitled to stay for at least 5 to 10 minutes after your lecture has ended, I would argue that the next lecturer is just as entitled to claim the room for themselves at least 5 to 10 minutes before the next lecture starts.

With that said, it is usually well possible to stay around to answer such questions, though that does neither mean that the room will be reserved for you (the next lecture may already be under preparation), nor are you automatically the ""main party"" (in that you may block the ""lecturer's desk"" or any such central device, rather than cluster your discussion in a corner of the room to give the next people space).

4225,4225,6739,How to describe the differences in skewed data with same median but statistically different distribution?,"I am comparing length of stay after laparoscopic and open appendectomy in over 160000 patients. LOS is typically a skewed variable so I use the median and interquartile range and ranksum test to describe the result, which is 2, IQR 2-3 and 2, IQR 2-4, p&lt;0.0001. So there is a highly significant difference but it does not show that well in the median and IQR. 

The difference in length of stay is very small. This finding is a negative finding but still interesting as it goes against what most people think about LOS after laparoscopic appendectomy. That is why I want to report on the difference in LOS which is not evident if I only report median and IQR with p-value.

The arithmetic mean (3.1 vs 2.8 and a difference of 0.3 days) is not recommended as the distribution is skewed. I wonder if any other measure could be used like, geometric mean (2.5 vs 2.3, difference 0.2 days) or harmonic mean (2.1 vs 1.9 days, difference 0.2 days)?  When can I use geometric mean or harmonic mean? 

I am inclined to use the harmonic mean which comes closest to the median and gives a difference of 0.2 days. Is this incorrect?
",Roland,https://stats.stackexchange.com/users/21094,"If you want to describe the difference in distribution, perhaps something like a Q-Q plot, or a pair of kernel densities would be common tools, though I assume you have quite discrete looking distributions, in which case that may make something like a pair of barcharts/histograms or a pair of ECDFs better (if possible on a single display)

If you do go with looking at the difference in ECDF, the two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic would be the ideal ""measure"" of significance to go with that, since it's based on the biggest (vertical) difference in ECDF.

If you compare barplots(/histograms) for a discrete distribution, you might like to look at the kinds of measures of discrepancy indicated by smooth tests of goodness of fit (Neyman-Barton type tests), but where the statistic is adapted to two samples.

The actual answer to your question is this: It is far better to have a good letter from a faculty member who is relatively unknown than a bad letter from someone they recognize and respect.  In fact, the latter is probably the worst thing that could happen.

If it is already too late, i.e. you have asked Professor X, he's agreed, and you've sent him the material (which is probably an online link these days) then work hard to make writing the letter easy.  Put together the following information and send it fast:


Include your student number.
Remind him which of his classes you have taken, and when.
How did you distinguish yourself in those classes?
How would you describe yourself? What are your strengths? What are your weaknesses? He is going to have to answer those questions when he writes your reference, so the more details the better; but these must be things your referee knows himself.
What are some of your academic and nonacademic accomplishments that he may not remember?
What makes him particularly qualified to write a letter for you? That is, why should the recipient of the letter value it over a letter from someone else?

The actual answer to your question is this: It is far better to have a good letter from a faculty member who is relatively unknown than a bad letter from someone they recognize and respect.  In fact, the latter is probably the worst thing that could happen.

If it is already too late, i.e. you have asked Professor X, he's agreed, and you've sent him the material (which is probably an online link these days) then work hard to make writing the letter easy.  Put together the following information and send it fast:


Include your student number.
Remind him which of his classes you have taken, and when.
How did you distinguish yourself in those classes?
How would you describe yourself? What are your strengths? What are your weaknesses? He is going to have to answer those questions when he writes your reference, so the more details the better; but these must be things your referee knows himself.
What are some of your academic and nonacademic accomplishments that he may not remember?
What makes him particularly qualified to write a letter for you? That is, why should the recipient of the letter value it over a letter from someone else?


This goes in an email that says, ""Thank you very much for agreeing to write a reference for me on very short notice.  I hope the following will be of use to you when you write it.""

Then any singular cocycle (with integer coefficients) $\alpha$ representing the fundamental class of $X$ will push forward to a singular cocycle $\phi_{\ast}\alpha$ representing $d$ times the fundamental class of $M$.  Thus, $\frac{1}{d}\phi_{\ast}\alpha$ will be a cocycle (with rational coefficients) representing the fundamental class of $M$.

The prototypical examples are as follows:

On the other hand, if $M$ is a higher genus surface, then this strategy is obstructed by Euler characteristic.

You are quite right about the angle strain. Because orbital interactions are not optimal in this geometry. Consider $p$-orbitals, then a natural bond angle would be $\theta\in [90^\circ; 180^\circ]$.

In the cyclo propane $\ce{C3H6}$ - which you can also describe as trimethylene $\ce{(CH2)3}$ -   bonds have to be bent to overlap at all. A possible way of describing the bonding situation is regarding each $\ce{CH2}$ entity as $sp^2$ hybridised. Two of these orbitals are used for $\ce{C-H}$-bonds (not shown) and one forms an inner two-electron-three-centre $\sigma$ bond (left). Leaving $p$-orbitals to form some kind of degenerate $\pi$-like orbitals (middle, right). 



This very general approach can be derived from a Walsh diagram.

Especially the symmetrical orbital 8 resembles very well the schematics. A quite rigorous approach for this theory can also be found here.

It is noteworthy - as mentioned by ron - that there is no notable increase in electron density in the centre of the ring. This may be due to the fact that there are much more orbitals having nodes in the centre than there are without.



Now bromine is known to be easily polarised $\ce{{}^{\delta+}Br-Br^{\delta-}}$ and may intercept at any point of the ring causing a bond break and relaxation to a less strained structure. It will most likely attack at the the $\pi$ type orbitals since bromine is an electrophile. The mechanism is analogous to the addition of bromine to ethene, which is nicely described at chemguide.co.uk. The essential part is the attack of the bromine at the HOMO(s).



The ring opening reaction can be reversed by adding sodium.

However, when there are bromine radicals present (UV light) then substitution will occur:

It is noteworthy - as mentioned by ron - that there is no notable increase in electron density in the centre of the ring. This may be due to the fact that there are much more orbitals having nodes in the centre than there are without.



Now bromine is known to be easily polarised $\ce{{}^{\delta+}Br-Br^{\delta-}}$ and may intercept at any point of the ring causing a bond break and relaxation to a less strained structure. It will most likely attack at the the $\pi$ type orbitals since bromine is an electrophile. The mechanism is analogous to the addition of bromine to ethene, which is nicely described at chemguide.co.uk. The essential part is the attack of the bromine at the HOMO(s).



The ring opening reaction can be reversed by adding sodium.

However, when there are bromine radicals present (UV light) then substitution will occur:
\begin{aligned}\ce{
Br2 &amp;-&gt;[\ce{h\nu}] 2Br.\\
&amp;+(CH2)3 -&gt; (CH2)2(CHBr) + HBr
}\end{aligned}

4239,4239,6760,What is the difference between a telephoto lens and a zoom lens?,"Looking at the product page for Nikon lenses, I notice a distinction between telephoto lens and zoom lens.

What is the difference between the two?  Why would I want one over the other?  I wiki'd telephoto lens but remain confused about this distinction.

Please talk to me like I'm stupid. :) I am hoping for a completely lay explanation.  In particular, I'd like to understand in what situations I'd use a telephoto lens, and in what (other) situations I'd use a zoom lens.
",Kirk Woll,https://photo.stackexchange.com/users/4477,"Telephoto and zoom are two completely different things.  Zoom simply means that the focal length (apparent magnification) of the lens can be changed, ie, it looks like it can look at things either closer up or further away by adjusting it.  

Telephoto, roughly, means that the lens has a relatively narrow field of view, thus it can be used to look at things further away.

Telephoto lenses can be either zoom or prime.  Zoom means that they can change how far they are looking at or prime means they have a fixed amount of magnification and can't be altered.  (Like an old instant camera with no zoom, but with much better picture quality.)  The reason for using a prime is that they are a) cheaper and b) produce much, much higher quality images for the price.

Similarly, a zoom lens can be in any part of the focal length spectrum.  You can have a 17-40mm zoom, which is basically wide angle (and not at all telephoto) or you can have a 100-400 zoom, which is entirely telephoto.

Longer answer...

Dry out the laptop first

As Xavierjazz mentioned in a comment, make sure the laptop is completely dry before you try to use it.

The only way to be sure it is completely dry is to completely dismantle the laptop, wipe up any moisture you see, and allow all the components to dry for several days.  If you do not dry it, moisture could remain in place or wick further into the laptop and cause permanent damage.  You can use a vacuum to suck air out of crevices or low-velocity airflow from a fan, but do NOT use high-velocity air such as compressed air (which can push moisture further into crevices).  Although rice is widely recommended for drying out electronics, more recent studies have debunked its ability as a desiccant.

You might need to disconnect the built-in keyboard

If the keys are indeed stuck ""on"" then you may need to disconnect the laptop's keyboard cable from the motherboard in order to prevent the stuck keys from affecting the input from any other keyboard you try to use.  For example, if the laptop's Shift key is stuck ""on"" then anything you type on a different keyboard connected to the same laptop will be affected by the Shift key.

USB keyboard or iPad as a keyboard

Once you've gotten past that hurdle, the simplest solution is to use an USB keyboard.  However, you can also use a remote desktop app such as Splashtop, a keyboard app such as Air Keyboard, or any number of other apps that you can find by searching ""ipad as keyboard"" in Google.

&lt;util:list id=""sysEnableCheckUrlPatterns"" value-type=""java.lang.String""&gt;
    &lt;beans:value&gt;/module1/**&lt;/beans:value&gt;
    &lt;beans:value&gt;/module2/**&lt;/beans:value&gt;
&lt;/util:list&gt;


(2) Write an interceptor:

    public class SysEnableCheckInterceptor extends HandlerInterceptorAdapter {

    @Override
    public boolean preHandle(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response, Object handler)
            throws Exception {


            /* 
                If system enabled then return true. Otherwise return false (and optionally write something in response)

            */
    }
}


(3) Configure that interceptor. In 3.1 you can do it as follows:

    @Configuration
public class AppConfig extends WebMvcConfigurerAdapter {

    @Resource(name=""sysEnableCheckUrlPatterns"")
    /* or use @Autowired or @Inject if you like */
    private String[] sysEnableCheckUrlPatterns;

    @Override
    public void addInterceptors(InterceptorRegistry registry) {

    registry.addInterceptor(new SysEnableCheckInterceptor()).addPathPatterns(sysEnableCheckUrlPatterns);

    }

}

The problem is that Mathematica can't calculate the last integral for any arbitrary $n$, although it can, correctly, calculate its value for hardcoded $n$s. Like $n=1,2,...$.

My question is:
Do you have any idea on how I could calculate it, perhaps by rewriting it a bit, or by using some other trick? In case it helps, the result should be $n^2\pi^2$.

Note: Actually it can be calculated with Cauchy's residue theorem, but I'd like to avoid taking that route, if possible. Though, if it can't be done otherwise, I will post a solution with residual calculation so that this question has an answer.

Is there a more mathematica-y way to label these plots?

Why does FourierTransform converge while same integral manually written does not?

My listview is not responding  , i tried changing this

The activity is successfully running , but i am unable to listen for listclick events. 

How to correct this?
